I try to make reservations each time I go because the wait can get a little long when you don't, which we still experienced a bit of a wait on Friday when we went to which we decided to sit at the bar. I want to say it took around 40 mins after checking in to be seated but as mentioned we found a spot at the bar and just ate dinner there. \n\nThe ambiance is always so nice. I love the decor so much. It reminds me of Barcelona! :) \n\nI order almost the same thing each visit and every time it is tasty. Things I recommend: beef empanadas, garlic shrimp, meatballs, Brussels, broccolini, potato brava. All are fabulous! \n\nFor drinks: The sangrias are a must, we always have a pitcher of each version.",

The service was impeccable and our server was nice, even though his shift was ending. \n\nThe menu was a bit complicated to read and understand, I ended up choosing the potatoes with salsa and cheese over top. I thought it would be a little different (salsa and cheese) it was more like a tomato paste and thick mozzarella. It wasn't bad, just wasn't for me. \n\nMy problem was that I came there very hungry and I wasn't able to eat how I wanted, but I had an amazing time there with friends and the great service.",

The menu is pretty extensive and changes periodically, which is nice if you frequent -- you can still get the staples you love while also trying new dishes! They can mark up the menu for me to show what's vegan or can be made vegan (sometimes I still have to ask questions, but we get to an answer quickly), and there are plenty of options so I'm not limited to just one or two things.\n\nThey have fresh bread baked all throughout the day... to say it's UH-mazing is an understatement. I often fill up on the bread before my food even makes it to the table!!\n\nThe service is usually great and on the occasion when it's not, it's still good.\n\nThis location only has valet parking after 5pm. There is also a parking garage next door.\n\nThe ambiance is perfect for date night. They turn the lights down around 5/6pm and light a candle on each table.",

The Spicy Beef Empanadas were also very good. We shared a slice of Burnt Basque Cheesecake, which was the perfect finish for our little soir\u00e9e. Onto Hamilton at The Fox. We'll definitely go back to this eclectic restaurant and try some more options of their great cuisine... might try the happy hour next visit.",

I'm more of a sweet wine person and the sangrias were more on the bitter side. We then got our table and started with fried cauliflower and calamari. The fried cauliflower was really good! Definitely had a kick to it. \nThe calamari was okay. We didn't think it had much flavor to it, but it was cooked well. The charcuterie board we ordered was okay as well. Didn't pair with anything we had so of anything to eat the cheese and salami with. Last we had steak, it had a  great flavor and was cooked very well. We thought it came with different potatoes, but maybe we were confused.",

We pride ourselves on pairing great wines with great food and great cocktails. I would like to make sure you get that experience. I can be reached at ncleveland@barcelonawinebar.com.

I loved the black salt in the flor de sal as it was perfect with the sourness of the drink. The white sangria was also another table favorite. It was perfect for a warm day and with our dinner. \n\nAll the desserts we had were also great. I especially loved the crunchiness of the flan. Can't wait to come here again!",

I absolutely love the ability to grab little plates to try and share with friends and everything I've ever had here is delicious. They also offer larger plates that take about 45 minutes to an hour to come back but they're definitely worth the wait. We had the Chicken Pimientos last night and that sauce!!! I need the recipe! \n\nIt can get a little loud inside sometimes but they have outdoor seating as well. The patio is so lovely, especially now that the weather is cooling off! \n\nI'd also recommend coming here on your birthday because they do a fun little birthday drink for you (reference the video) and they share it with the table! \n\nTip: Valet Park! It's only $5 whereas the deck is $15 for 2 hours then an additional $5 for every hour you add on.",

Put the mushrooms on top- chefs kiss. Sooooo good together or separate.\n\nThe only item we didnt like was the bacon wrapped dates. Whatever cheese they used on the bottom of the plate just overpowered our taste buds. I wouldve gone with something more subtle. You couldnt even taste the date the cheese took over!\n\nGreat place with delicious tapas and drinks though!\nValet is fantastic considering parking in this area can get super pricey.",

So if you're in a large party or would like a table. I would recommend making a reservation. The wait would have been 30/45 mins for a table for two so we decided to sit at the bar. \n\nFor food we ordered the bacon wrapped dates, grilled chicken, fried cauliflower, and the crispy calamari. For drinks we got a Alebrijes cocktail and a Nectar sherry. \n\nOverall both the drinks and food was good and a decide portion size for tapas style dishes. Taking off one star because I thought the chicken could have been grilled a bit more and the sherry was super sweet! But I just charged that to those two things not really being for me, but someone else may like them. \n\nIf you're looking for a nap cap after a date night or a spot to connect with a small group of friends before you get into something else, I would definitely recommend here. \n\nOh! And if you drive valet park. It's only $5 and definitely worth it.",

The only thing is it can be tough doing tapas with big groups with different tastes, allergies, etc, but it's definitely doable - and fun! Just love the vibes here - I've closed it out a few too many times. \n\n*FOOD*  I always start with a charcuterie board. I like the jamm\u00f3n serrano (an aged thinly sliced ham - has a smokey taste to it that I love), soria chorizo (spicy chorizo sausage), drunken goat (goat cheese soaked in red wine - a MUST), and the manchego (your hard cheese, and I mean it's manchego, need I say more?). \n\nFor tapas, they're always changing the offerings but these are some of my trusty go-tos that will please the table. The patatas bravas are a must - and they're a guaranteed favorite for all of the table. The whipped sheep's cheese is delicious and comes with hard toasted bread. The croquetas are a must for cheese fans - they are basically a delicious ball of cheese with little bits of ham in it - hot and gooey in a crusted shell. If your table likes seafood, I recommend the grilled pulpo and mussels. \n\nRegardless, you can't go wrong here. Oh, and don't forget an espresso martini for dessert here. These espresso martinis are coffee-forward - and not solely coffee cream liqueur like other spots do it - so they're good stuff. \n\n*PARKING*  They have valet only right out front for a couple of bucks. \n\nThis place will be a guaranteed favorite once you try it.

Likewise, in the evenings, the lighting is dim to the point of having to hold up the menu to the light coming in from the windows to read it. \n\nI have likewise luke-warm feelings about the food, which I found to be very hit or miss:\n\nBurrata 2/5 - The very mild flavor of the cheese was drowned out by the rest of the plate. \n\nLamb Chops 5/5 - Well-seasoned and tasty, if a tad salty.\n\nMussels 5/5 - Some of the best I've had anywhere. \n\nWatermelon Salad - 4/5 Tasty, but a rather small portion for the price and ingredients.\n\nScallops - 4/5 Scallops themselves were perfectly prepared, toasty on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside, but the sauce was a poor choice of accompaniment. \n\nOverall, I can recommend it, but only just.",

The wine list is also on point and made more desirable by the inclusion of one of my favorites varietals, Tempranillo.\n\nBarcelona has a lavish indoor space along with an expansive bar with indoor/outdoor seating and a wide variety of artisan cocktails. I'm old so it's easier for me to find room a little earlier in the evening, but this is a hot spot and gets packed during prime time and on weekend evenings. If you enjoy food in a nice place, Barcelona should definitely be on your list. Valet parking is available, or you can park in the Interlock garage.",

The ambiance was amazing... giant fire in the outdoor fireplace the umbrellas situated perfectly so even though there was a lite drizzle we could still be outside to enjoy it! The staff went above and beyond even supplying little signs on the bar celebrating the newly married couple. The entire staff was terrific! We had over 100 in our party and they took our orders in stride offering their full menu of drinks. The bartenders were so good! Their specialty gin and tonics were a hit! \nI worked with Julie Clark prior to this event and she took care of making sure our night went off without a hitch. We had a delicious meat and cheese board, fresh bread, Spanish olives and almonds that were constantly being replenished.  If you are looking to host an event in Atlanta please give Julie a call because Barcelona Ironworks should be on the top of your list! .",

The menu and Vibe are all very similar. I would recommend getting three small plates per person for a full meal. I went with my parents in the afternoon. They were just switching from brunch menu. We got the octopus and the prawns. The octopus came with garbanzo beans and had a nice Char on the outside and was succulent in the middle. The prawns were really plain. It seemed like they were just boiled with some kind of chimichurri/ bacious oil. Can't recommend that one. The server was really nice and was able to make some recommendations.

The only dish that was a little lackluster was the happy hour steak tartar. It was just too many different flavors competing. What elevated the food and drink experience beyond expectations was the service. Eric, who I assume is part of management, went above and beyond to chat with us and make sure we were taken care of.

                "text": "I've been to the other location of Barcelona frequently, but this was my first time at this location. I enjoy this location because its just a few feet away from the Bellyard Hotel which has PuttShack, Velvet Taco and other eateries. Plus there's plenty of parking options. You can park/valet in the lot near the restaurant or park at the in the deck next door at the Interlock for hourly parking. There's also parking across the street in the garage near Little Trouble.\n\nThe service was good. Our server was extremely attentive and was great at suggesting recommendations for drinks. We ordered some tapas. The broccolini, jamon y manchego croquettes, spinach and chickpea cazuela. All were really delicious especially the spinach and chickpea cazuela. I am not a huge chickpea fan, but it was one of my favorites of the night.\n\nI also order the large meat plate with steak, chicken, pork and sausage. Overall, the meat was under seasoned. The chicken was the most flavorful.  We got the half order and there was enough for two people. \n\nAt this point, I feel like I've had just about all their tapas, but I can always try more on the menu. The sangria is always my go to and it never disappoints. I will definitely be back to this location.",

Give your car to valet for sure because the deck ended up being more expensive for me. \n\nWe had a reservation so it didn't take long to get seated. It's a tapas place so we ordered a bunch for the table. I would say my faves were the fried chicken, the empanadas and the patatas bravas. The portions r quite small if you're splitting with many people so order two of each if you're a group of 6 or more. \n\nThe service was a bit slow at some points and they had run out bread? But then we saw more bread on other tables. Food however was definitely 5 star quality.",

However, after checking in 3 times with the hostess and 2 hours AFTER our reservation time, we were seated. Every time I would ask the hostess, they would say 10 minutes or 15 minutes. People who checked in after were seated first and there were multiple empty tables. I understand shortness of staff but the table we were sat at was clean and ready 30-40 min before they sat us down. The food and drinks are good but expensive but although the staff is nice, the poor service will prevent me from going back here.",
