When they got to us, we were given a couple shots of whiskey on the house for our wait, and they said our beers we ordered with dinner were also on them. Much appreciated and they were fairly speedy getting food out to us. \n\nFood was great, the fish and chips was delicious. \n\nWe also ordered a couple beers after food, and they comped those as well, leaving us very happy with their thoughtfulness and generosity in spite of the wait. \n\nThe location is great, the outside patio had a great vibe and they kicked on the heaters as it dipped a little cooler. Great spot, highly recommend.",

From the atmosphere, to the food, to the service. Bravo. \n\nWe walked away talking about the food and even making a point to note that we must come back tomorrow for dessert and a drink to celebrate my cousins birthday. That grilled cheese is not just any old grilled cheese but an elevated experience, maybe a little dramatic but maybe even tear inducing. \n\nI walked away noting that this was comfort food done well and I felt comfortable and welcome. Brandon was a gem and he was extremely attentive. \n\nI don't normally give 5 star reviews because well it my first visit and I like to go a second time to make sure it wasn't a fluke.

The bar tenders were very attentive and helpful. We ordered a couple allagash white beers. I have to say that as a white ale lover it was one of the best beers I've had. We ordered the grilled cheese w/ tomato soup bisque, shrimp skewers, lamb skewers, mushroom skewers, and the sticky sesame wings. All was great. I especially liked the shrimp skewers that had the perfect amount of flavorful spice. We enjoyed our food so much we ended up ordering a fudgy pecan cookie. Wow! That cookie was the bomb! The filling of ganache was light and flavorful. I would definitely recommend this place.",

                "text": "It's not enough in this town to have a great bar anymore, the kitchen has to be great too. PH is a smallish, walk-in only spot in Eastlake at the corner of Hosea Williams and Second. It's a good location because you're all like \"Let's go to Oakhurst\" and then it's all like \"look at all this cool stuff before Oakhurst\" and then before long you're stuffing your face at PH.\n\nWife and I went on a date night, relying on the restaurant's current rep for serving American bistro-style small plates. We both had a bourbon mint punch (kind of Julepy) that was sweet enough to cut through the major hit of savory brought by our munchies, which were served adeptly and kitchen-hot. Got the shrimp skewers (great seasoning on these), lamb skewers, cold Asian noodles (spicy), buffalo cauliflower (good texture), and another shrimp skewer for good luck. All great quality stuff.\n\nWe sat on the patio which was pretty laid back and peaceful. The bar seats were packed inside, so I am led to believe that the real experience of PH is at those bar seats. We'll try for that next time and further explore the menu. Finally, the meal was actually a pretty good value. Multiple high quality small plates, two cocktails, and tip for less than 60 bucks. Can't beat that these days.",

The fries were crispy on the outside with yummy seasoning and soft on the inside, just how I like them. The parking can be found behind the building and then you can walk right up on the back patio. Dining is a little close quarters inside but plenty of room and heaters for outdoor seating. The only complaint I have is the portion for pricing (as the name was a bit deceiving, or perhaps it's right on point)... but it IS some quality food if you're ready to spend a little money!",

It was a bit cloudy/rainy that day so I could see how this place would fill up when the weather is better. The patio is covered and there are fans for the summer months. For drinks, we had the bourbon tea punch and an oopsie daisy. We ordered drinks at the same time that we ordered food. Our server was attentive without being too pushy. Everything came out around the same time and we could tell the drinks had been sitting around based on the condensation on the  glasses. Both were a little on the sweet side and didn't taste particularly strong, but were still good especially for the price. The fish and chips was interesting because it was fried fish nuggets as opposed to a larger filet. The real standout for me was the Italian grinder on focaccia sandwich. Wow! This was so well crafted and with the softest bread, and was just the right amount of spice. I would come back again and again just to eat that sandwich, and I'm not a huge sandwich person, especially when I go out for dinner. \n\nI also love the story behind this place - named after a rescue pit bull!",

They didn't skimp on the alcohol it was nice and balanced. It was a bourbon sour. The ambiance was laid back and other customers were very friendly as the seating on the patio was close.",

A sweet waitress that I didn't get her name brought homemade peanut butter cookie treats for the dogs.\n\nThe party peach cider was THE BOMB!\n\nHelpful hint, order the bread for the mussels to soak up the yummy wine garlic sauce and the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e of the day was lemon basil and was phenomenal.

I fell in love with all the food that graced my tongue.\nWhat I loved most, besides the food, is that the bartenders are real bartenders. My guy was able to pair my drinks with my appetizers. I asked him to fix me a drink that paired well with the watermelon salad (which was OMG Good, btw) and he made the best Hendricks Martini I ever had. The other appetizers I tried include the Cold Noodles, Baked Okra (no listed on the menu) and the Rice Krispy treat. \nAt this time the dinning tables are seated outside on the back patio. In door seating is located at the bar.",

We are happy to see they have started marking DF on items that are dairy free!\n\nIf we're just going for a bowl of fries and drinks, this place is great.

I was already annoyed trying to find a spot. Got in and no space on the patio. So we headed inside and found some tables on the other side of the bar. After that everything was fantastic, service was awesome, these guys are quick to help. Food, which is a lot of small plates that are kinda elevated, was absolutely on point and quick to table. I had skewered mushrooms (seasoned and charred perfectly) and the buffalo cauliflower (not the least bit wilted but at the same time cooked enough so they aren't hard). My wife had the wings with a chili sauce (bangin'), steak skewers (lil pricey for the amount of meat but still really tasty) and a basket of fries. And all this stuff was on it. They have great cocktails too. Highly recommend the Rose Gold Hoops. Even the dessert (the owner is a pastry chef btw) is on point, we got to try out the brown butter rice crispy treat which had just the right amount of brown butter taste without being obnoxious. This is definitely a five star place, plan on coming again soon.",

Families with children are seated in the parking lot, receive no service and are summoned with a megaphone to get their food. On our visit, we were the only family in the lot, yet the host still felt the need to use the megaphone to alert us our food was ready. I totally get it. People do need quiet spaces without young children. So just state clearly that children aren't allowed. Don't tell me there's a \"backyard\" where I can sit with my family. There's a parking lot below the main diners where you will eat and drink in paper vessels and be shouted at to pick up your food.",
