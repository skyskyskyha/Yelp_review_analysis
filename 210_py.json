                "text": "I tried Urban Wu on the recommendation of a new acquaintance who said it was a small hole in the wall, family style authentic Chinese restaurant. It was neither small or a hole in the wall. The restaurant is brand new and is located in a new shopping center surrounded by construction. It is so new that there isn't even a permanent sign up yet. Their only issue for locals might be there there is limited parking as there is large construction equipment taking up a sizable chunk of the parking lot. \n\nThe restaurant is modern and has some interesting design details, though it looked like the tables scratch up the newly painted accent wall. The restaurant is medium sized and can accommodate a couple of large groups. \n\nWe were the only patrons at just before 6 pm, but it stared to fill up. The staff was very nice and attentive. They must be really popular for to-go/carry out orders as they had a rack full of orders ready for pick up. \n\nWe had the fried chicken dumplings, the fish roll, shrimp fried rice and the fried ribs. Everything was delicious. \n\nThe sauce that comes with the dumplings was excellent. We got some hot chili oil and soy sauce for the fish rolls which was better than the clear sauce it came with. The ribs were crispy and a little dry, but had a tasty garlic topping. It was better with the hot chili oil. The friend rice was very good. I would definitely recommend them.",

Add 2 small spring rolls for 95cents. The food came quick as only one other table occupied and chef was not occupied.  It not a fancy place by any means but Im fine with that.",

I believe the Dry Pot Cauliflower was cooked with peppercorns, but they weren't hanging out perilously in the dish, perhaps for the sake of someone who might swallow one by mistake. This special has a sauce that is delectable and not all that spicy. My favorite dish at Urban Wu and one I have only encountered once before is Sichuan Jelly Noodle, thick slices of jelly made from mung beans and shredded cucumbers in chili sauce. I know it doesn't sound terribly appealing, but I was fantasizing about it the other day and whenever I am in this neighborhood, it's on my mind.",

Very casual - you can wear whatever you want.\n\nWe split appetizers and each got an entree. Here's what we got:\n- Veggie Spring Roll ($.95): Very mini!\n- Pan Fried Veggie Pot Stickers (8 for $9.95): Good! Cool presentation!\n- Sesame Chicken ($14.95): Large portion! Tasty!\n- Mongolian Beef ($14.95 + $2 for beef): Also large portion and also tasty!\n\nWe appreciated the big portions. We each had enough for a leftover meal. The service was super quick.

We love trying new Chinese spots and this one is definitely one we wont forget! \nWe ordered:\nKung Pao Chicken\nHouse Combo Lo Mein\nMongolian Beef\nGeneral Tso's Chicken\nDumplings\n\nEverything came out super fast and was piping hot. We loved everything! The amount of sauce to protein/veggie ration was spot on (I hate when stuff is drowning in sauce or loses it's crunch). The portions are great and everything was fresh. I love their take on the dumplings -- they're different than what I've ever had. I loved the crunch and the sauce. If I lived in this area I have no doubt this would be our go to for Chinese. The staff was so friendly!! We mentioned we were celebrating a birthday so they brought the birthday boy a shot (which ended up being a literal full glass of whiskey haha). So cheers to Urban Wu! You guys are doing it right and I can't wait to order some Chinese takeout next time in ATL!",

I almost always order the same things and those are always great. Once in awhile I try something new that's not great. For example the Lo Mein- not great here. My favorites are the chicken with chili and scallions and the sour cabbage and fish soup. I've tried most of their lunch specials and those are all good. I frequent order lunch for my team and we order from the lunch menu. It's a good portion but I do wish it came with an egg roll or something. You just get the entree and rice in a smaller portion than the regular menu. The food is really authentic, and the more Americanized dishes are made well. Always fresh and fast. \n\nWhere I would dock a half to one star is the service. It's often good. It's never great. When dining in, sometimes the water is frequently refilled and other times I have to flag someone down. And the food is spicy (that's what they're known for)! \n\nI absolutely recommend dining here if you want great Chinese food. Just know the service may be spotty and be prepared for authentic flavors.",

                "text": "If you know me, you know that my #1 thing to eat is dry hot pot. There's nothing on planet earth as delicious as this. Fight me.\n\nWe were driving all day from New Orleans on our way to the Northeast for the holidays. We planned on stopping in Atlanta for the night.\n\nNow, a vegan road trip inspires all kinds of feelings... from hungry and angry because you had to break down and get the tots at Sonic (OK, not so angry) to hungry and sugar silly because you grabbed licorice at the convenience store to extremely raging effing hungry, very much determined to eat an actual damn meal at a sit down restaurant. It had been 8 hours! I needed more than popcorn and sesame crackers to satisfy me.\n\nLuckily Yelp pointed me in the direction of Urban Wu on this frigidly cold night of 12/23. Always my savior, that Yelp. I took one look at the vegetarian menu (so many great options on there btw)  and saw a vegetable hot pot with tofu and ended my search.\n\nIt was on the later side of the evening and while the restaurant was empty, they were doing a booming take out business. It's a casual spot in a strip mall, but done up just fine... and they offer cocktails and wine. Yeah, I needed some of that before crashing for the night down the block. No, I wasn't driving. Maybe in spirit. Always in spirit. I'm a nervous passenger.\n\nEveryone in here is nice and welcoming, despite the later hour (9ish). I ordered my beloved hot pot as hot as possible (underlined), despite the usual dubious look that I always get when I order something raging hot. Yes, I'm an American girl who needs her food as hot as can be. And some sparkling wine that was cold and bubbly. \n\nAnd the verdict? This might be one of the best dry hot pots I have ever had! I didn't even have to specify veggies like at some places and it came out with tons of my favorite thing, lotus root. There was also cauliflower, a lot of tofu and carrots and bok choy and mushrooms and others. Besides that, they listened to my plea and it was perfectly super hot! \n\nMy husband and I barely spoke as we devoured everything. At the end, we vowed to make this our Christmas road trip tradition... even if upon our millionth hour of the drive back home this week we vowed to never make that drive again. With the promise of Urban Wu, come December 2023, we may even ignore the prospect of a long winter road trip!",

But needed just a little more salt for my taste. \n\nThe Dan Dan noodles were fair to above average but had a little too much soup. \n\nThe cumin lamb was the best dish of the meal! Seasoned with just the right amount of cumin to give it its signature aroma without being overly salty or sweet. \n\nThe soup dumpling (chicken) were a little disappointing.

I explored the offerings in Atlanta and this popped up as one of the premier options.\n\nThe location itself is in a semi quiet strip mall and adjacent to the busy streets. When you walk in the service is friendly and fast. We got soup dumplings, fragrant lamb, crispy beef, and Sichuan spicy chicken. The food itself is solid, it has the classic numbing sensation. My biggest gripe is with the prices and value overall. The food is solid though the medium sized portions are not appropriate for the large price. I appreciate the local Sichuan flavors in Atlanta though I do not think this is the best way to experience it.",

There wouldn't have been a problem with the one I got tonight - it was loaded...and I ate more than my share, in his memory! I tried the hot and sour soup, as well. It required no \"doctoring\" to launch it into the ranks of my two BuHi faves; from La Mei Zi, and Xin's in Duluth.\n\nEven though I ordered delivery, the dishes were HOT and SPICY and DELICIOUS when they arrived.\n\nI'm still a Buford Highway girl.

Since that time I've dined infrequently at the restaurant, and outside of occasional poor Asian restaurant service, it's amazing.\n\nUrban Wu has a menu packed with Sichuan specialities and some lao wai/typical Buckhead crowd dishes. I'm sure they do a perfectly great job with these dishes, but don't go to Urban Wu for that.\n\nInstead, look under Chef's Specialty and/or Classic Sichuan and Hunan Cuisine. You honestly can't go wrong with any of these selections. My personal favorites include: C12 Pork Intestine with Sour Cabbage and Hot Spicy Chili and T10 Cumin Lamb.\n\nHow spicy are the dishes? Everybody's palette is different. For this spicy food junky, I find the items of a reasonable spice level. For some of my friends with more sensitive palettes, they find the food pretty spicy, but the good kind of spicy. There's no novelty heat here, simply great flavors.\n\nService is usually passable here. You don't go into a Chinese restaurant, especially an authentic Chinese restaurant, and expect good service. Still, it's never pleasant to have bad service. During a recent visit, the two front of house employees sat down in the middle of the dining room and were too busy watching TikTok videos to serve their tables. This was downright infuriating because the food is spicy and they need to keep refilling water. \n\nOccasional poor service does not change the fact that this is a five star restaurant. This is probably the best Chinese restaurant in Metro Atlanta. It's certainly one of my favorite spots.",

                "text": "Came here with a group of seven on a Saturday evening. One of the people in the party is vegan, and this place is vegan and vegetarian-friendly. They were able to accommodate our large party with no problem. They seated us and provided us with a menu. The servers were also very helpful and able to answer questions about the menu. All the staff in the restaurant were wearing masks, and the tables are socially distanced. \n\nIt seems like this place gets a lot of business through DoorDash, take out, or Grub Hub. They were very busy fulfilling orders, but they did not neglect customers dining in. \n\nThe food came out for the group around the same time, which was great. I ordered the broccoli with shrimp, and I substituted the white rice for the egg fried rice, which was $1 extra. The rice was delicious, as well as the broccoli with shrimp. They were both very well seasoned. The sauce over the broccoli with broccoli was delicious too. This place reminded me of authentic Chinese food. I did have some of the orange chicken. It was also very tasty. The only thing I did not like about it was the orange peeling pieces in it. I also tried the spring rolls. They do not have egg rolls, but the spring rolls were not the cold kind they were fried. Those were very good. \n\nOverall, the service and food were really good. The prices were great, and there was plenty of parking in the parking lot. I recommend this place, and I would come back.",

On occasion when I'm craving Szechuan Chinese food I'll come here if I don't feel like venturing to Buford highway or Duluth.\n\nThis place is also on a number of food delivery platforms such as Uber eats and door dash. I've tried a number of dishes here primarily the hot numbing fish pot, dried fried cumin lamb, spicy fish fillet and stir fried vegetables. It's consistent and tasty. \n\nCompared to Buford highway and Duluth I do find the portion sizes to be a tad bit smaller. I normally like ordering a couple dishes with friends and dine family style.",

The server who originally greeted us ushered us to a 8 seater table jn the middle of the restaurant (all the other tables are 4 seater) - which was great - because we all wanted to order a ton of food and share. There were two other tables occupied. \n\nBut as soon as we sat down, a young lady came up to us and loudly said that since we were a smaller party, we would have to pay an 18% surcharge for sitting at the big table. After we were seated. Not 18% gratuity, that is not what she said. She said 18% surcharge. Never heard of that before. Also - no excuse me,  no nothing...so abrasive.\n\nWe agreed to move to a 4 seater table and have an extra chair stuck in. The lady in question then proceeded to stand at the ushers table and glare at us. Now we are south Asian, but half of us speak Chinese and those that do, felt uncomfortable enough to tell her she was rude. We left.",

I'm glad that R and I came here tonight, because we had some delicious food!\n\nParking is plentiful, and the free parking lot is right in front of the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is small, and there is no outdoor dining.  Indoor dining is allowed, but most people either order their food as take out or contact a food delivery service to drop off their food at their home.\n\nAfter seeing that no customers were eating inside, R and I decided that we were going to eat in the restaurant, and picked a table in the corner away from anyone else who could possibly eat there.  We were lucky and didn't have to worry about being exposed because no other customers ate inside while we were there, and we got there at around 6:20 pm on a Monday evening (MLK Jr Holiday).  All of the employees that we saw wore face masks, and every person who came to pick up take out food also wore face masks.  The servers were nice and efficient.\n\nAfter looking through the menu, and there are a lot of menu items on the 5 page menu, I ordered the Kung Pao chicken dinner entree which came with a bowl of white steamed rice, and R ordered the Mongolian Beef dinner entree and that also came with a bowl of white steamed rice.  R also ordered Xiao Long Bao (pork soup dumplings).  After food arrived, we decided to share the entrees and the soup dumplings.\n\nI thought the food was delicious!  The Kung Pao chicken had a slightly sweet and spicy flavor, and the bite size pieces of chicken were tender.  The Mongolian beef was tender and had lots of flavor.  The two entrees were soooo good!.  The soup dumplings were good and the dipping sauce was slightly salty and tangy, but I thought the dumpling wrap was a little too thick.\n\nOverall a delicious dinner.  I'm glad didn't have to worry about social distancing, since there weren't any other customers eating in the restaurant while we were there.",

The soup is one of the top 10 on my list.  First nite, I order hot & sour soup, Singapre noodles, and the Mongolian beef.  The beef was tender and I love the spicy taste of it.  I even asked for extra hot oil.  Second nite, I ordered yes again, Hot & sour soup, that's how much I love their hot & sour soup especially their crunchy noodles for the soup.  Pan Fried Pork Dumpling & Hunan Shrimp.  Everything was really good. I love spicy food, everything I can taste 'Wok hay' and good flavor.",

Their hot and sour soup was delicious as well.\n\nI was so happy with the level of spice . . . you can get any level you like and when they say spicy, they mean spicy!  So good and seems authentic.

The service was great and the food was quality.   I was a little worried to get take out because I just knew it wouldn't be up to par but boy was i wrong. All I do is get take out now because I know the food will be  fresh. I swear I can't say I've ever had a bad experience.\nSome of my favorite dishes are:\nFish in chili oil \nChicken with three kinds of mushrooms\nHoney roasted tofu\nFried eggplant\nBeef lo mein\nMongolian beef\nAnd bang bang shrimp. \n\nYou really can't miss with any of those dishes.",

If you are wanting a more authentic Sichuan and Hunan food experience, this is the place. You MUST try the Ben Ben Beef appetizer - it is served cold, so don't be surprised,  but the flavors are incredible.  The Hunan and Shan City Chicken were also excellent and came with sticky rice.",

We decided to order a couple of things and just share and I'm so glad that we did because everything was delicious. The one thing I didn't really care for was the bang bang shrimp. They weren't bad but it's just not what I'm used to when I usually get bang bang shrimp and I was disappointed in the portion size for the price. The house fried rice is a must get it was so good that's what really filled me and my friend up. The dumplings were great 10 out of 10. The cocktail oh my goodness was delicious it is the Hawaiian punch and it had several different rounds in it so 10 out of 10. I will definitely come back to this spot and have.",
