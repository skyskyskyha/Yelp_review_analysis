                "text": "Are you a snob? Do you stick your pinky out when you hold your glass? If so do not come here. Highland tap is an Atlanta institution. It has a below 4 score on Yelp yet on every nite you go the place is slammed. Why? It's an outdated as hell restaurant, a time capsule into the 90s. I always tell my friends it is impossible to have a bad time at Highland Tap.\n\nWent on a Man Date and we both had the time of our lives. One got the Rib Eye, the other got the prime rib. We cut it in half and shared. I've been coming here for 15 years and first shot at the prime rib. Y'all, it's the best I've ever had. We sat at the bar, and the bar tender asked us if we have ever been. I told her Highland Tap is my happy place. I got my dirty martini with Blue cheese stuffed olives and smiled away. \n\nBottom line, food snobs stay away. This is a locals spot, who absolutely adore this place.",

You'll be surrounded by stacked stone walls. The bar area isn't exacty as cute as the dining room but that didn't matter to us. We ended up in a dining room with lights and huge stone fireplace. Very cozy. \n\nFood was good. we split the artichoke dip which  was a decent size for an app. My husband got a burger and onion rings. Burger was good. He finished it but was STUFFED. Counld't finish his onion rings but I tired them and they were very good. Thick cut - not super skinny.  I got the Checken sandwhich fried, I had them add pimento cheese (no added cost) and it was very good. Highly reccomend. It was humongous. Like the bun was half the size of the chunk of chicken and I will say I would have liked more pimento cheese but I would absolutely order again. I got my go to French 75, it was good, but very lemony. I had them add some st. germain to my secind one and it was better for me (In like sweet/floral)\n\nFor desert we wanted the bread pudding but it sold out before we could order desert (so if you want that say it up front) so we split a slice of red velvet which was very moist. Not too much icing, but not outstanding. \n\nServer was very friendly and attentive but not overbearing.\n\nWe would definitely come back and would bring friends here for an unassuming night.",

I got a reservation for a Saturday evening and the staff was really nice even though we were a little late which I thought was really nice. \n\nWe got seated and got some beers to drink quickly which was awesome. Our waiter was great! To start, we got the spinach and artichoke dip and the complimentary bread. The dip was delicious and amazing with the little bread crispy and the brown bread was also fresh and warm!\n\nFor the main, we got the meatloaf, steak sandwich and the center cut fillets. Everything was delicious and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals! I thought the steak sandwich was a great deal and all the sides were awesome. This is a great place to bring anyone for dinner and can't wait to come back again.",

Came with a lot of little toasts for both dishes but we easily ate it all with the seven of us. I saw some tables with bread but we were not offered any.\n\nFor my entree, I got the 10 oz prime rib and garlic spinach. It was perfectly cooked medium rare and had so much flavor. I really enjoyed it and would recommend. It seems like they are known for this dish as many people on other tables were ordering it too.\n\nDrinks were okay - maybe stick to beer and not cocktails.\n\nService was decent but we were told that we could only split the check six ways and evenly when we were ready to pay. When we made the phone reservation, they told us that they could only split the check evenly for parties over six (we had seven). For some reason, our waitress told us we could only split it SIX ways with seven people. A bit hard as we were all expensing the meal.",

The rest of my party wasn't there yet so I have to wait around a little bit and they said that I could go and they wouldn't give away my seat, because they had already seen me. So they're at least going to work with me and they were really nice about it because they saw me there. Super friendly by the way.\n\nWhen you come in, you got to enter through a door that goes basically to a basement. Which you really don't expect. There's a bar right next to it that I thought it was initially but it was not! You going downstairs and there's a full restaurant and bar down there. Aside from the delay in seating, everything was good. The venue was a little bit dark, but it adds to the Ambiance of it.\n\nAll the service was good. You sit out and they give you bread and butter. The menu is about two pages, so it's not overwhelming, but everybody there was willing to explain the menu and answer any questions that you needed to have answered.\n\nI ended up getting the rib eye, which was pretty good. It could have been seasoned a little bit better, but it was still good. It was very tender so I give it points for that. It was a really nice size as well. I had it with the asparagus which came with hollandaise sauce. Definitely worth a try for sure.\n\nI would come back again, for another cut of steak probably. I will say, that the horseradish sauce that came with the prime rib was actually something that went really well with the ribeye. Typically I don't like sauces on my steak, but it needed a little extra, and that was just the perfect thing! So that was a good combination. Yes I would go back again.",

My friend and I overall had a decent experience, the place is definitely cool and the food was pretty good. I wasn't that big of a fan of their patty melt but the drinks and fries were good and the ribs my friend had were awesome.\n\nThe negative side of our experience was that Kory was very much so not convinced my friend and I were of drinking age- lol. I understand we may look young but there is a way to be polite about things. she's 22 and I was there for my 23rd birthday. How many 19 year olds do you know try to go to bars with fakes at 3:30/4pm on a Friday ordering one drink with food- .\n\nWhen we were looking at the drink menu before giving us a minute to decide Kory said \"BY THE WAY we'll have to see your IDs if you order any drinks\" ... ok yeah duh? He comes back, we order a drink each, he meticulously looks at our in-state IDs. I thought the fun time was over until he came back with the drinks. When he sees me reaching over to slide mine closer to me he says \"oh be careful, it's filled to the top.\" . As if I can't be trusted to move a glass that's clearly full. My friend and I were respectful to him and gave him a normal tip even though to me- that interaction was offensive as I greatly do not appreciate being treated as a child since I'm a hardworking adult. Maybe he'll learn someday that just because a patron is 20-30 years your junior doesn't mean you can treat them like they're 5 years old. \n\nClearly Kory hit a sore spot with me huh? Highland's is probably a pretty good place in general. Without that experience pissing me off this would probably be a 4 or 5 star review so take that as you will.",

So after he snatched the bifold as if we were keeping him too late;  the manager dede came in and cussed at us for allegedly stealing Martinis, and yanked glassware and a knife out of my boyfriends hand for no reason. He ended up with an injury, then told us how everything we were doing is illegal, and we should be embarrassed of ourselves.

It's downstairs with stone walls and dark interior, a beautifully painted mural on other walls, warm reds and old candle lamps on the tables. The service is always on point. Their cocktails are great... try the dirty martini! They give you a sidecar so it's almost two martinis you get. Monday nights they have a prime rib special that is so good for less than $20. The escargot appetizer is also delicious. Ohhh and the beet with goat cheese salad is amazing - I make it at home now too. Superb! The only thing I don't rave about here are their mashed sweet potatoes, they have too much seasoning. They taste like a spicy pumpkin pie, I enjoy flavor but not THAT much. My husband always orders their greens (he says they are the best he's ever had) - I'm not a greens gal so I'll just take his word for it. We go often, I love the Highlands. We always take our out of town guests here too when they visit cause it is always a big hit.",

                "text": "TIP: There's limited on-street parking in the front, and a steep, narrow staircase to the restaurant below. There's valet parking in the rear, which is at restaurant level. \n\nFamily friends recommended this place and said that the Prime Rib was stellar, so we thought we'd give it a try for Sunday brunch. Overall, I thought our experience was only okay. First, they didn't offer the Prime Rib on the lunch menu, so we really didn't get to test their claim. Service was good, but the food was average. There were some hits, but more misses. Restaurant d\u00e9cor is dark and English tavern like, which I thought was a great atmosphere.\n\nFOOD: Several of us tried Eggs Benedicts, the Traditional Bene ($13), Crab Cake Bene ($22), and the Surf & Turf Bene ($23), all with a side of Grits or Mardi Gras potatoes. The benedicts were all outstanding, as were the Jalape\u00f1o Grits, but the Mardi Gras potatoes were a little on the dry side. We also split an Iceberg Wedge Salad ($10), which was good, but nothing special. Same with the Tap's Patty Melt ($14). The Prime Rib Hash & Shirred Eggs ($15) was dry, the meat well done, and not very flavorful. Finally, we had the Tap Egg Platter ($12) which was okay, but the biscuit was dry, and the side of Sausage & Gravy ($8) was bland and watery.\n\nI would like to go back and actually try the Prime Rib, and I think the bar would be a fun place to hang out. At this point, it's hard to say I'd highly recommend Highland Tap, but I'd say it's probably worth giving it a try and judging for yourself.",

They're located in Virginia Highlands in the same building as Fontaine's , La Tavola etc. Valet parking is available in the rear of the building. Don't be thrown off by the retro decor, this place is a gem.\n\nThe first time I went, it was with a group and everyone really enjoyed everything. This time, my mom and I were in the area and decided to stop in. There was no wait and we were seated immediately. They have really good drinks! I wanted to get the apricot whiskey sour that I had previously, but they were out of some of the ingredients. We ended up getting a cocktail called \"get behind the mule\" which is basically a blood orange Moscow mule. It was very refreshing and they don't skimp on the liquor. The calamari was really delicious. My mom got the ribs with collard greens and I had the crab cakes with asparagus and mashed potatoes. While the crab cakes had more breading than I prefer, they were tasty and the vegetables were good. \n\nEach time I've visited and have been welcomed by the staff and received great customer service.",

However, our server was attentive and fast. The ambience is more casual, which we like. \n\nWe ordered the Oyster Rockefeller, escargot and french onion soup for appetizer. The oysters and escargot were delicious. We cannot say the same about the french onion soup. The first few bites were good but then it started tasting sweet and cinnamonny, tastes we were not familiar with in this soup. It left a weird after taste.\n\nFor the main entree, we ordered 32oz prime rib to share with mashed sweet potatoes. The prime rib was the star of the whole meal, especially with the au jus and horse radish. I would order a different side next time as the mashed sweet potation was borderline too soft and too sweet. \n\nFor drink, we had the espresso martini (recommended by our waiter) and it was delicious! \n\nWould recommend this place and we would return for more prime rib and espresso martini.",

This place was in a triangle corner, unpretentious looking, and you had to go down!\n\nWe did and were we surprised!  Old dark wood paneling, a sunken bar, booths, and a dining area on the side.  We went for a booth.  Great friendly cordial service! Great special drinks! Great bar food!\nGreat prices!\n\nWe had their martini, which is served with a remaining pour, and a regular bourbon and 7.  We had the pretzel and other snacks.  The atmosphere was cheery and dynamic.  The fact that it has no windows escaped us.  Everyone is a regular.  You can tell.  It's one of those places.  A secret neighborhood gem that's an institution.\n\nWe definitely want to go back.  I've recommended it to everyone.  I'm surprised many locals have never been!

You have to climb down stairs upon entry through the front door, so be mindful or you might miss it. They had a large beer and cocktail menu, but I came for the french onion soup. I enjoyed it! Had the perfect amount of bread/onion/broth/cheese on top. A friends got the artichoke and spinach dip which was just alright to me, nothing to write home about. My other friends got steaks and they all enjoyed those as well. Parking can be a challenge to find, there's only street parking available or valet lots I believe. I was able to circle the block and find something on the street. Can't wait to come back and try more food when I have a bigger appetite.",

The atmosphere is very pub-like...dark, a little dated, customer emphasis on the bar but the food was such a great surprise. \n\nFirst, let me start with the drinks...they're strong! For food, we ordered the oysters and spinach artichoke dip. The dip was good, nothing over the top but it was a good dip and the toast rounds they serve with it are perfectly toasted and seasoned. The oysters were cooked really well. I'm a texture person and I don't usually like oysters but these had enough firmness to make it pleasant to eat.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the braised lamb shank. I was happy it was a really good sized shank; I wasn't even able to finish it. Despite the size, the meat was really tender and well-seasoned. The jus was really good but I wish they added a little more mashed potatoes to soak up all that ju. The next day, I woke up and continued to eat the lamb. I'll be back for this lamb for sure!",

The greens had a sweet/ smokey flavor to it (I l like greens that are made with vinegar) which caught me by suprise.\n\nNice place\nNice food\nRecommend this place!",

It was truly one of the best prime ribs I've ever had. \n\nThe other dish I ordered was the Chicken Marsala- it was delicious on a different level.. hahahaaha....very tender and flavorful. Usually chicken breasts don't cook that well but this was over the top and I'll be definitely going back for it. \n\nIt was snowing a little when we started with the main course and the view from where I was sitting was mesmerizing. I had their Christmas tree and wreath on one side, amazing food in front of me and there was snow on the other side. What else can you ask for on a Christmas Eve? \n\nThere were plenty of street parking available right infront of the restaurant so that made life easy. \n\nLastly, my wallet didn't cry when I saw the check because the food turned out to be pretty reasonable.",

Our waiter (and the cook) went above and beyond to accommodate us and were super friendly and knowledgeable. And the food and drinks were both great! The highland skillet really hit the spot after a long day.",

                "text": "So let me start off by saying the service was great! When I arrived, they had just wrapped up brunch, so we sat at the bar and had drinks until they reopened for food. Drinks were tasty, and one of the bartenders was in a really good mood. Upon making it to our table. We got the escargot and the spinach dip as appetizers and then we got the prime rib with the mushrooms and later ordered six oysters. I was not a fan of the food at all. I can tell that it was fresh, but it was just something about it all that was lacking flavor. The escargot was very basic. The escargot crust had no real tasting notes and the  escargot itself just tasted bland like they boiled in water and put it under the puffs. The spinach dip was a good texture, and the baguettes that came with it were nice and crispy, but there was  something missing. The prime rib was a nice texture as well but to me it also didn't have any significant tasting notes, so I was glad that they brought out the sauces with it. Lastly, I had six oysters, as they were the special.  Whomever had shucked them. I guess they wasted all of the oyster liquor out of them so they were a little dry and sticking to the shell. I am a Oyster person, so it was not the best experience and for $18 I was not happy. Overall I'm not sure I'd be back, but if I do come back, maybe I'll try a regular steak and see what that taste like.",
