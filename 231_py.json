The crispy cod tasted decent but lacked seasoning and everything else completely lacked seasoning as well so it was just bland all around. \n\nThe staff was super friendly and the ambiance was really nice but everything else was very subpar! My entire meal was about $21 and it was $21 I wish I had back.\n\nParking is also plentiful but expensive but that's what happens when you're in colony square.

                "text": "As promised, returned to Brown Bag Seafood this week after having an AMAZING experience at the Peachtree Corners location. I found myself at the Midtown location tonight as it is closer to my home. I arrived around 7 pm on a rainy Sunday night (parked in the lower level parking deck and had to wander around a bit in the upstairs Colony Square area to find the entrance). Upon entering, no greeting tonight but in all fairness, the gentleman associate nearest the door was on the phone. I noticed grouper was the catch of the day so I inquired with a different associate (African American woman with green dreads) whether or not the grouper had bones (I HATE bones). She assured me the grouper was sans bones, so I went with grouper (very well done) as my entree. Food came out shortly thereafter and everything looked great. Unfortunately, everything did not taste great. My rice/quinoa was lukewarm, at best. I did notice when I was placing my order that the lid to the rice pot was open so I believe this is why the rice was not warm. Similarly, the chowdah was lukewarm (also noticeably missing the oyster crackers that I was served recently). Luckily, I had amazingly delicious (right warmth) grouper and veggies. The young man who was on the phone upon my entrance (African American male with glasses) walked by after dropping off food to another group of customers. I did pull him to the side and shared as an FYI that the rice and chowdah was lukewarm. With great empathy, he took the feedback well; he apologized and of course, offered to replace it as he noticed I was not eating it either of them. I politely declined and instead asked for to-go containers as I am going to happily warm them up tomorrow for lunch (Huge thank you to the young man for attempting to make it right). I did notice upon his return to the counter area, he quickly shut the lid to the rice pot. He later came by and gave me a free cookie. How kind of him (PS - Due to his redemption efforts, I am rating this review a 4 vs 3). So, albeit not the same experience as earlier this week at a different location, I am still a FAN. See you again real soon, Brown Bag Seafood.\n\nQuick Update (not to my overall rating) - Parking was $15 for 1 hour and 12 min. Pretty steep but hey, we're in Atlanta. Just keep that in mind for those coming to eat on a budget. I am going to ask next time if Brown Bag Seafood offers parking validation (fingers crossed as that would be nice seeing that Politan Row offers it when you dine in their Food Hall). If not, I will try to locate street parking.",

When I tell you we were all pleasantly pleased with the excellent service we had. The atmosphere was amazing, as they had a nice playlist of music playing and even the assistant manager came by to chat with us to make sure we had everything we needed. As for the food, everything we had was fantastic. The lobster roll was overflowing with lobster meat and it was sooo good, which was my 2nd favorite thing to eat. The shrimp and grits were among the best I've ever had but unfortunately, this dish has been discontinued. The fish was cooked perfectly on the sandwhich, the tacos were good, and green garlic shrimp were seasoned very well. They have a few locations around town so if you ever want to grab a nice lunch real quick, I highly recommend checking them out.",

I ordered a simple fish and chips with an additional side of Clam Chowder and a Ginger Lemonade. \n\nMy order came piping hot and fresh, and plated very nicely! A+ for presentation & A+ for taste. Thinking back, I'm curious if the Cod was Wild Caught?!?!.... Pricing is a tad elevated but is expected for seafood. My entire order was about $35 and overall healthier than If I would have eaten somewhere else. \n\nCustomer service at the Midtown location is very friendly and attentive. They also play great music when dining in. I highly recommend the ginger lemonade. So simple and refreshing! As for the Clam Chowder, that's a MUST. It was delicious and fresh and simply wholesome! I will be ordering this again and again! \n\nMain cons were the Buffalo/Blue tots with my Fish. They were barely covered in the sauce and this was an upcharge for that. Also, the coleslaw wasn't very tasty. Seemed like it needed a bit more sauce to boost the flavor up. \n\nOne thing to also point out, ordering is like the sub sandwich restaurant Which Wich. You grab a pen and a menu and select what you want by checking a box. You then hand it to the cashier, grab a number, and your food is brought to you. This restaurant is also located in Colony Square so be advised of parking cost unless you walk or use a scooter. Just an fyi.",

I walked over with friends so not sure the parking situation, but colony square has a deck I believe. \n\nWalking in, it's fast casual and pretty small. I wish this location had more seating because we ended up taking ours to go and sat in Politan Row nearby. We wrote down our orders on the whiteboards given but then when we went to the counter we said our orders anyway so not sure what the point was. \n\nI got a bowl with Grilled shrimp and greens and grains. I also got the supergreen garlic and lime sauce. My friend got a lobster roll. The bowl was actually pretty good and I really liked the sauce! However, we really did not enjoy the lobster roll. It felt torn between trying to be a Maine style (more mayo) and Connecticut (more butter), and was way too much bread. The parmesan tots it came with were also strange - the shredded parmesan didn't really stick to the tots, they were just kind of there as topping. I also understand that prices are up temporarily but it really did not feel it worth the price. \n\nOverall, I liked the bowl and how fresh it was and its a quick option in the Colony Square area.",

It's right by my office and I had never tried it so we decided to give it a go! We came a Friday evening around 7pm and of course got the lobster roll and then a bowl with shrimp! We split them and decided to get some boss sauce and ranch along with the entrees to try them!\n\nThe wait for food was short which awesome but it's a small restaurant so we took it next door to Politan Row to eat. The sauces were truly the highlight of the show! The boss sauce and ranch were phenomenal!! The entrees, not so much. The lobster roll, while I didn't pay it was supposed to be $30 dollars ish which was a lot. It was fighting between a Maine and Connecticut.  The bread was warm but overwhelming to the lobster which had a good mayo mix but overall it was just -meh-  Not to mention the tots were mid and tasted like freezer tots with random Parm shavings on them.. not really park tots\n\nThe bowl on the other hand was also mid. The sauce was good and the shrimp was good but the tails were still on? And it was still like $16... in my opinion it was a little overpriced for the food and it was just meh.",

Brown Bag Seafood Co has an excellent concept of making your own entree for a fast casual dining experience. The fish of the week is always a good choice, but don't count out an order of fried shrimp tacos, a salmon power bowl, cod cakes, or any other combo you can think of.\n\nThe sauce bar is awesome for trying out new flavors and mixing and matching. \n\nDo not forget to pick up a warm chocolate chip cookie to finish off your meal! It's seriously the best pick-me-up and satisfies my sweet tooth any time! Sometimes I come just for a cookie (shhh!)",

                "text": "Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon as a family of 4. We hit a sweet spot where we were to only people needing to order or be served for about a 20 minute period so the two guys working were uber-focused on helping us decipher the menu, understand the options, and make choices we'd be happy with. They gave us samples of the rice mix (my name for it) and the clam chowder (they call it chiefs).\n\nHonestly, there were more enticing options than we had capacity to eat. So we ordered two large entrees plus a kids meal (pics attached) and fed the 1yo from portions of the different meals.\n\nThe food was all prepared and plated very well, but the seafood needed some seasoning. We were able to fix that using their sauces. The sauces are so good that I'd be willing to buy bottles of it to use at home if they sold it. I'd also pay good money to buy their gingerade; make sure you drink that when you go!\n\nHere's what we ordered to eat:\n\n--I ate a Mega-Protein Powerbox. This is a hidden menu item (again, shout out to the staff ). The bottom layer is their signature rice mix, which is a mixture of rice, quinoa, and wheat berry topped with a lemon vinaigrette sauce. The rice is topped with spinach and then a salmon fillet and grilled shrimp., Given a choice of three sauces, I ordered the sesame-soy siracha...and let me tell you: right choice! I don't love spice but I was willing to withstand the spiciness of this sauce because the flavor was so good on my food. \n\n--hubby had the dinner plate with daily catch (currently St. Peter's Fish). Ordered with the spicy cauliflower and chowda as the 2 sides. It's also served with garlic bread and \"salad\" (honestly, it was just half a handful of wilted greens underneath his other food). Whatever the green sauce was that came with this, he couldn't stop talking about how good it was\n\n--my toddler chose the kids chicken strip meal and then ate almost nothing ...but my 1yo happily ate off her tater tots and my rice mix situation.\n\n--a side of the Louisiana tang slaw. It was just okay. I wouldn't order it again.\n\nAll in all, this was a solid experience. It's located in Colony Square, so there are lots of little spaces to socialize, sit, or have a little camera phone -photoshoot\n\nWould absolutely eat here again when in the area.  And I can't say it enough: the customer service was amazing!!",

We took said elevator down to meet them, and they were nowhere to be found. We tried reaching out to them multiple times, but they never answered our calls. We had to leave our work stations to go find food elsewhere for a meeting, and never got the food we were promised. After over an hour, they called us back and got angry and started yelling at us on the phone, saying they were there the entire time even though we searched for them in every car. Their description of the loading dock was accurate, so I believe they arrived, didn't want to take the elevator, and left with the food. No idea if the food is any good, but never, ever cater from this company.",

It's pretty big and filling! The tartar sauce is soooooo good! However, I wasn't much of a fan of the other things it was served with. The coleslaw was very bitter and bland, the \"salad\" is just lettuce, and the fries were well seasoned but soggy (but that might be because it was take out). The clam chowder was decent with a good amount of potatoes and clam. It's a good feeling when you eat fried food and don't feel gross afterwards! I don't know about the other things, but definitely recommend the fish!",

When you walk in there's a bunch of laminated menus and plenty of markers; so I assumed you simply check off what you want, hand your menu to the cashier, pay, they'll wipe it off and we'll both be on our way.  Awkwardly my brother and I ended up just telling them what our order was.  Whatever...not a big deal.\n\nHowever I attempted to order the fish and chips, sub parmesan truffle tots for regular tots.  Cashier told the cook, she seemed to acknowledge, yet I still got regular tots.  While waiting for our food we both got cokes from the fountain drink machine.  You can tell just from it's color that there was just not enough syrup mixed in, and the taste was WAY off.\n\nBrother ordered the mahi-mahi (\"catch of the day\") tacos with parmesan truffle tots.  ALL of the main ingredients were simply underseasoned and bland.  The breading of my fish was half soft/soggy and barely had any crisp/crunch.  At least the tots were cooked well.\n\nStaff was very friendly and service was overall fast.  However prices are way too high for such bland and mediocre food.  I can't overstate how disappointed I am in Brown Bag Seafood, and am reluctant to ever try again especially with so many great restaurants in the Atlanta area.",
