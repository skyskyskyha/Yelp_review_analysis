        "text": "An absolute gem located right off of Northside Drive. I forgot to take any pictures because I simply devoured the food as it came to our table! Instead of one large dish I chose to order multiple smaller items, including a tempura veggie roll and the lotus root, and everything I had was delicious. The food was also very decently priced, so I felt like I COULD order a number of smaller items without somehow ending up spending more than an entree. The service was extremely quick, with items coming out as they were prepared, and the interior feels intimate while still having a lot of space to seat patrons. The menu also has pictures of everything which I love! The only downside for me is that it is very seafood heavy, so if you aren't feeling like ramen or something with seafood you do limit yourself. But it's a great perk if you are looking for seafood!\n\nParking is ample in the lot right outside the restaurant as well!",

        "text": "After all these years Ginya is still a fantastic little go to spot for good ramen every time.  It shows that you don't have to be flashy, have a huge place, or be full of hype.  If you have a friendly welcoming staff, and good ramen then people will find you.\n\n1. Ramen:  Still one of the best in Atlanta.  They are also one of the few spots that offer spicy tonkotsu and you can even add extra spicy.  They offer a variety of other types of ramen, which are delicious in their own right.  The chasu pork is excellent, I always get extra.\n\n2. Appetizers: They also have an extensive appetizers list.  Too much to list.  I always get the seaweed salad, and teriyaki chicken skin on a skewer.  \n\n3.  Service:  Service has always been good.  Attentive, and friendly.\n\n4. Ambiance: Comfortable, and not pretentious at all.  Dark wood covers most of the small restaurant.\n\nGet there early on Friday and Saturday evenings as it can get busy and packed and they do not take reservations.  The only thing I wished is that they would bring back lunch service.  I miss that.  It stopped during Covid and they never brought lunch service back after that.",

I was surprised to see that they had a corner booth large enough to fit our group (10 people), but it was perfect! The restaurant had a casual atmosphere and was comfortable. \n\nWe ordered a variety of drinks, appetizers and main courses once we were seated. While there, I tried: \n- Warm Sake: Something interesting to try, but wasn't something I'd order again\n- Cream Soda: We thought this would be like the cream soda you buy at the store but instead it is melon soda with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. This isn't something our group liked or that I'd recommend. \n- Beef Skewers: I wasn't a fan of these as they tasted like charcoal from the grill but some others in the group enjoyed them\n- Pork Yakisoba: Absolutely delicious and something I'd order again! \n\nThe service was good, but I didn't realize they had already added in a 20% tip for themselves as it isn't very noticeable on the receipt. I didn't realize until I looked back after the fact to realize they had gotten two tips then.",

I brought a friend of mine here that had never liked sushi or tried raw sushi. So we ordered the Sashimi Platter which was great for two people BUT If he was going to back out on me then I could finish alone. It was fresh and great. I purposely chose this place because they had Ramen and Sushi, which for some reason is hard to find... BUT his ramen was so authentic and delicious, my baked spicy pork curry was so flavorful and amazing... the Mochi was fresh and the best thing there because it so surprised me and gave me a complete surprise... was the RED BEAN PANCAKE WITH MATCHA ICE CREAM! OMFG! I will definitely be a frequent here... in my mind... it is unmatched and has set my expectations for any other Japanese sushi or ramen restaurant that I try! The vibe is relaxed, with no dress code and there is usually a wait on the weekends but free parking. Oh! And I suggest the Kikusui Perfect snow sake if you want to try rice liquor. It is chilled $25 per bottle and is not so dry tasting! They have the one with the pulp and without the rice pulp... JUST GO OK!",

        "text": "If you love raw fish, look no further! Growing up eating sushi made by my dad, I'm extremely cautious and mindful about where I'm eating any raw seafood. Since Ginya is always busy, and you can see the chefs preparing the bowls, I felt comfy grabbing a sashimi don bowl here. My first experience was great, and for $20 I couldn't resist this tuna, salmon & eel bowl. I've come back more than a handful of times now and every time the fish is high quality the tastes so fresh. \n\nThe appetizers are also great, my favorites are the squid legs and chicken karaage. The agedashi tofu left much to be desired, and I wouldn't recommend. The breading around the tofu was too soggy, and the sauce was lacking in flavor. \n\nThe vibes of the restaurant are very cozy, yet open. Great place for a date or for moderate sized groups!",

Our waiter was super nice and patient with us since we could not make up our minds what we wanted. \n\nThe vibe of the place is cozy and warm. Extremely welcoming considering there was a crazy storm going on outside. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like too much was that my highball was pretty flat and weak.

The tonkotsu was warm & hearty on a chilly Fall night. we also had fried oysters and lotus which were both delicious. We finished with masago sushi and some ice cream. I'd recommend pass on the mochi ice cream as it had that frozen grocery store taste. But other than that the food & service were spot on for a family friendly place.",

        "text": "TL;DR: Really wanted to like this place, but we got take out and the food wasn't good.\n\nARRIVAL: Ordered take out, but entering the front door, it opened to the bar area and it looked a little like you entered the backdoor. Waited a few mins for someone to notice me and ask for my name to pick up the order which was ready on time.\n\nAMBIANCE: It's fairly dark inside (furniture and lighting) but has a small, quaint vibe.\n\nMENU: I absolutely loved the options on the menu, covering a lot of options from sushi, entrees, yakitori, and ramen.\n\nFOOD: Here's where my disappointment comes in. We ordered the spicy miso ramen, 2 pork belly skewers (salt), pork katsu curry, california roll. The best were the skewers, then katsu curry, ramen, and california roll. The california roll was extremely fishy right when we opened it and the rice was dry. The ramen was fairly bland and i didn't finish it all; I had some of the leftovers the next day after microwaving and it was actually an improvement.  Craving katsu curry was the reason we went there and I thought it was fine, but nothing special.\n\nPRICE: I think the prices were on par for authentic asian food outside of Duluth.\n\nOVERALL: I really really REALLY wanted to like this place since it's right up the street and was really craving a lot of what we ordered but was extremely disappointed in its' execution. I am honestly shocked by all the good reviews here even though I really want to support a small family business. I have very, very little to go off of to try this place again.",

Didn't take pictures of the other food but the ramen and yakisoba noodles were good too. I would pass on the salad though, it was a small portion and the sauce was pretty bland. The service was great as well but they do have a limit of how long you can sit at a table. Which kinda sucked since some of my friends noodles came out super late. They also charge 22% gratuity for parties which we weren't aware of. Overall, would come back if I'm in the midtown area.",

In addition to being strangely mushy, it had several rather noticeable bones.\n\nThe miso salmon collar, another dish we've had numerous times and are rarely disappointed by, also rated very poorly. In addition to being rather burnt, it was unusually oily, and neither the meat nor the miso glaze seemed to have any flavor. \n\nWe did have one sushi roll, which was fine, although rather small in portion size.\n\nLooking around as we left, it seemed as though all of the other customers were having sushi, so perhaps ordering from the kitchen wasn't the right way to go. Could well be another case of the menu being too large for the restaurant's own good.",

We try to venture out to new restaurants we haven't been to once in a while and hoping to find another great place to add on to our bookmark. This place made one of it. Normally we go to Shoya for the izakaya but Ginya izakaya is overall really good as well. The service was a bit slow but that is as expected since they were busy on a Friday night. Out of all the dishes we got, the Octopus & Scallop Carpaccio was my fav. It was light and fresh! The Okonomiyaki was a tad bit on the burnt side. It was good but you can taste the burn flavor from the hot pan. As far as the skewers, it was good too but nothing too crazy. For dessert, the batter was way too thick for the Fried green tea ice cream. So I just picked on the ice cream and didn't really finish the tempura batter. Will for sure give this place a try again and try something else in the menu.",

        "text": "What a great first impression! I can't wait to come back and sample more from the enormous menu. \nService was top-notch from the moment I walked in until the moment I walked out. I was promptly greeted and had to run to the restroom first. When I came back out, I didn't even get close to the table before one of the servers made sure I knew where to my table was located. I had some questions about the menu and she was extremely helpful. My server came back to check on me several times throughout the meal, but I never felt rushed. When I left the restaurant, I was thanked by three different people for coming in. That made me feel very welcome.\nThe restaurant and bathroom were both very clean. The decorations inside were not very plentiful, but just right. Tables, booths, and seats at the sushi bar were all wooden, which gave the restaurant a unique feel.\nI ordered the scallop and octopus carpaccio, and the tonkatsu Ramen. I absolutely loved the carpaccio. The wasabi gave me that burning in your nose, but in a good way. It was  a delicate and flavorful appetizer. The Tonkotsu ramen was one of the better bowls of Ramen I have had in quite a while. It was extremely flavorful. I loved the red ginger and the egg was perfectly cooked and marinated. The Hakkaisan sake that was recommended was very easy to sip and paired really well with my food. \nThe food alone is worth coming back for, but the service is so good, it makes it even more enticing to come back.",

There's so much variety, though, I kinda want to try it all. \n\nToday we got:\nChirashi don deluxe\nSquid legs\nSukiyaki croquette\nGinya box\nSpicy scallop roll \n1 piece of uni from specials menu \n\nThey have a huge shared lot with other shops in the strip mall. \n\nThe uni was Soo fresh and light on the pallette. A definite treat and luckily my husband doesn't like the texture so I never have to share. I would eat 3 more but not at $16/each. Definitely a treat  they do give you a nice sized piece though \n\nThe spicy scallop roll was filled with scallop and not spicy but has a great flavor! Also super filling \n\nThe ginya box was a bigger roll than I expected. Very nice presentation and delicious\n\nSquid legs were so crispy and fresh! I loved those. The mayo is tasty & with the lemon, a must try \n\nThe sukiyaki croquette was good but probably wouldn't order again. I didn't taste much but potato in this which I know croquette is mostly potato but ‍ too filling.. would skip \n\nSaw lots of items I'd like to try next time. Wish they had the bacon enoki like shoya but I saw some other mushroom items I'll try out next time!",

She said that she needs to reserve this table to other customers as they are on the line. HOWEVER, I left and came back in 3 minutes for restroom and did not see anyone sitting around our table.

It's chef's choice on the meat that you get so we got a combination of several chicken skewers, a pork belly, and a mushroom skewer. Everything was well cooked and I love the grill char flavor.\n- Ginya Don - Really delicious and fresh! Eel was so tasty and I think the presentation was great.\n\nIn terms of service:\nWe were seated in one of the rooms because we had a larger party (6 ppl) and I think they just forgot about us. The table right next to us was constantly getting beer refills and getting chatted up by the waitress, but our food took 45 minutes to come out after the appetizers. The food also came out unevenly, so no one wanted to start eating yet because we wanted to wait for every couple to get their food. Water refills were basically not happening at all.\n\nWill probably come back again because the food was great! Maybe I'll try and come at a less busy time and see if I can get better service in the future. Def go check em out!",

Food comes out quickly and they have a generous wine pour which is always appreciated. It's a little place but we've never had to wait for a table. It's a very casual vibe.

All the dishes tasted good and pricing was reasonable (mid-range) for the quality and serving. \n\nService:\nOur server Monet was very knowledgeable about the menu. She gave us a very helpful breakdown of what she would recommend. She was warm and friendly as well. Food took a bit of time but not too delayed.\n\nParking:\nPlenty of free parking in the plaza!\n\nOverall, highly recommend and will definitely go back!",

        "text": "The service here was amazing. I got seated at the sushi bar. The staff was really nice and this one sushi chef was really attentive and made sure everyone at the sushi bar had been served and asked if the food was good when it arrived. I have a hunch that maybe he was the head chef of the place? \nMy first thought was wow, the menu is HUGE, both in content and in size. I also really appreciate that they have photos for everything, it's really helpful. They give you a menu that has lots of different dishes, and then a menu that shows you pictures of the different rolls and what they contain, and then a sheet of paper for you to order nigiri and other sushis. \nI ordered the Nagahama ramen and lots of different Nigiri. Everything was  amazing. The ramen broth was very rich and creamy and the noodles were the perfect chewiness. The nigiri tasted very fresh.\nI came at a good time, around 6 because right after I arrived, hoards of people came in, showing how popular this place is, and for good reason. The food is good and I was most impressed by the service. I didn't have the wait much at all the entire time I was here. I was seated right away, got my order taken right away, and the food came out quickly. I was by myself and I was in and out in less than an hour. I love when a restaurant has quick service! I highly recommend this place!",

I went to Ginya with no expectation because it was my first time and I must say it did it's job . I had the crispy chicken skin and chicken on a stick and I also had the ramen . The only complaints Menu is huge , The area we sat was in the back by the kitchen and it had super cool decor but the table was still a little messy and I guess because it was late but I still enjoyed it . I want to go back and try again during the midday because I think that I would appreciate it more . The waitress was knowledgeable and very helpful even with her being busy . Def a hidden gem and you will enjoy it if you want a taste of oriental cuisine .",
