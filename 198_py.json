I read them my order number, gave them my last name, my first name, my hotel, my room number.  i told them I ordered thru Yelp and he said if I order through third party, its not guaranteed hot...wtf.  Blue Moon told me to contact Yelp for a full refund.  Yelp = the company that just connects customers and restaurants together, yeah...okay.  Terrible food, terrible service and terrible motto of \"only order direct if you want hot food\"\n\nFollow up:  we used the hotel microwave to warm it up and everything taste bland.  Hot wings are bland.  Pizza was burnt on the edge and mediocre at best.",

Id like to apologize in behalf of my staff and not being able to locate your order. All food should be delivered hot no matter what order type it is. The problem that sometimes occur is that the delivery driver bringing those 3rd party orders is not our driver and is a 3rd party driver and we have no control over how many orders they have within that route or how they are going to be delivering it to you. Please call me at the restaurant to discuss further and to give us a chance to make it right for you because that's not how we do business. thank you",

The pizza also lacks some flavor and we did not really enjoy it. pretty bland. we likely won't get this again. my parents were in town and they wanted to try something different and this pizza was not something they enjoyed. it may be better in the restaurant I'm not sure but as far as getting it delivered from Uber Eats we were not super impressed with quality or the flavors I neither was I.",

I was immediately impressed by the flexibility of the menu and even ordered the cauliflower crust just to try something new...and specified a wide variety of customized toppings. We also got an eggplant panini.\n\nIn short - it was delicious. Really happy with our choice. Be prepared for carbs! And the service was incredible - these guys went out of their way to be amiable and to make sure we had a great experience all around (including catering to our multiple random requests). This elevated level of service was not expected or even necessary for this type of venue. We were happy to voluntarily tip even more after our meal.\n\nAlso enjoyed the turtle cheesecake. Highly underrated.\n\nLooking forward to going back!",

I also ordered Extra Cheese, but for some reason I feel like they forgot this. \n\nI also ordered a side of Garlic Knots. I will say the Garlic Sauce they have is AMAZING! Bit on the salty side, but delicious! I'll be ordering again and trying other menu items, but imo the Classic Pizza just had too many veggies on it. Tasted like a Garden Pizza.

I've been getting the grandma's pizza recently over the make your own/another specialty pizza. I recommend it - it's a great detroit style pizza with a lot of garlic and flavor.\n\nWhat i've noticed though is their quality for the garlic knots. Now I know that the last few times I've gotten it as a takeout versus eating in, but it has 100% changed. The rolls are a lot smaller than before and the last time I got them they werent even knotty - it was literally like eating a bread roll dunked in garlic sauce.",

Thin crust was tasty but the sauce to cheese ratio was way off and sauce was on the sweeter side without much flavor/seasoning. Very very light on the cheese. The garlic rolls were served as plain rolls with a dipping sauce which is not what garlic knots are back in NY which left a lot to be desired. Wouldn't order again",

So what did we end up taking away?\n\nWe called ahead and ordered their Classic pizza ($21) and also got an order of their lemon pepper wings ($9.99)\n\nThe lemon pepper wings came in a serving of 10, with celery and your choice of blue cheese or ranch.  The wings were crispy, well seasoned and actually pretty good!  We both gave the wings a thumbs up.\n\nThe pizza was thin crust, and man did this flavor speak to you.  Loaded with toppings including pepperoni, peppers, mushroom, onion, and sausage, the slices were devoured and enjoyed.  Likely not as crispy because it was a to go order and a 10 minute drive home, but what we chomped on was very good.\n\nNot quite sure what the parking situation is because again, we got our order to go, although I know enough to know that if you park anywhere across the street from blue moon, you'll be booted. Ask staff and they'll direct you to self parking.   \n\nThe product Blue Moon Pizza delivers is great, boasting in your face flavors that make you smile with each bite. I'll definitely check them out again!",

There were no instructions for curbside pickup anywhere to be seen (despite advertising they do curbside pickup). So, I had to park my car and go in and grab the food. \n\nInside was absolute chaos -- including more disregard for their advertised services (no social distancing enforced, they were basically operating at full capacity including seating at the bar and tables not 6 ft apart). Servers were wearing masks and those preparing food had masks and gloves. Upon seeing this, I typically would've just turned around and left -- but I made the mistake of preparing online so I decided to stay.\n\nIt took 20 minutes from the time I entered the restaurant to the time I got my food. My order was certainly not ready and they forgot to include a soda I had also ordered with it. I realized when I left, but after spending 20 minutes inside of this restaurant with at least 20-30 unmasked people, I wasn't ready to go inside again.\n\nWhile waiting, I witnessed the following inside the restaurant:\n- people entering without masks, even just to pick up takeout\n- servers running around like crazy -- they looked way understaffed\n- people at tables in large groups (2 groups of 10+ at a table)\n- tables not 6ft apart\n- people sitting elbow to elbow at the bar area\n\nClearly, management here has decided to let politics and money make their decisions for them. DO NOT order from this business if you value your life.",

Just wanted to let you know the pizza in the picture is our white pizza not our greek. But both are delicious vegetarian options! Just didn't want you to be surprised if you came back and ordered a greek and it was different from what you remembered/photo. We thank you for taking a moment to share your 5 star review and look forward to your next visit. - Danielle Armstrong GM",

Well, this really happened in December 2017. As a visitor solely in town for a rival NFL football game where my team of choice was less than victorious, I found myself spending an extra day in Georgia with a desire for something other than hotel food. \n\nWhile Blue Moon should have been a choice based on its reviews, I found myself there primarily because it was one of the few restaurants still open on this terrible weather day but it did not disappoint. I loved absolutely everything about the pizza and noticed pretty quickly into my dining experience that there were quite a few regulars and many patrons who often place take out orders. \n\nKnowing that I would be stuck indoors until at least the next day, I ordered a key lime pie to go and it was delicious the perfect late night treat. \n\nIf find yourself in the area on sunny day or during not so great weather, I highly recommend paying Blue Moon a visit.",

The crust had salt & pepper on it only downside was when you got to crust it was a little too salty. Server was very good with checking up on us and being on point even brung me a refill before I got a chance to ask for one.",

First the bruschetta was marinera sauce with feta cheese on top... that is NOT bruschetta it needs to be actual tomatoes HUGE disappointment. The classic pizza is a simple supreme pizza one you could get from Domino's for like $10/12 for a large vs $15 for a personal size here... same ingredients and taste. The Luna pizza was the best thing it had spicy chorizo and that gave it a kick that was pretty delicious. Overall I probably wouldn't spend my money here again, for average pizza I could get something cheaper elsewhere.",

He then took my to go container in the back to slap on cold meat. I was hungry and started to not care about the whole situation. The sandwich was ok and the fries were good.
