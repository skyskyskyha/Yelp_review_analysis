        "text": "WORTH. THE. WAIT. \n\nFranklin Barbecue is one of the most if thee not the most famous BBQ spot in all of Texas. And does the hype live up to its name? You bet! We went on the Tuesday after Memorial Day around 10 am. There was already a long line of about 50 people. Franklin's provides lawn chairs for guests to use, so my friend and I grabbed one and waited it out. We finally got to the front of the line at 12 pm. We basically ended up getting 1 of everything. Here a few things that stood out to me:\n\n- Brisket: best brisket I have ever had!! Smokey, fatty, succulent, you name it. When you take a bite, it just melts in your mouth\n\n- Pork Ribs: again, like the brisket.. smokey and cooked to perfection. fall off the bone type of rib. meat is tender as it can get.\n\n- Pulled Pork: tender and smokey as well\n\n- Key Lime Pie: they put a good amount of lime because it was very tart but not overly tart. perfect amount of sweetness and great way to cool off after such a rich-flavored meal\n\n-Ruby's Dang Pie (Coconut Pineapple Pie): Very coconutty. Sweetness from the candied pineapples\n\nOverall, the hype is real and it is worth the wait whenever you are in Austin. Just make sure to go early so they don't sell out before you get to the front!",

        "text": "Is the wait really worth it? Yes. Probably the best BBQ, ever! And I had a lot of BBQ from all over, the most recent was a month ago in Kansas City. \n\nWe ended up waiting about three and a half hours in line from start to finish. Got in line on a Tuesday at about 8:30am and was number 14 and 15 in line.  They had plenty of lawn chairs for you to borrow while waiting. At about 9:00am or so they opened up the inside for you to use bathroom, buy some swag, get water (free) or buy drinks. A Franklin employee also goes through the line and takes a preliminary order from everyone. They tally up how much brisket, ribs, sausages, etc. are being ordered so that if you're one of the later people in line they can let you know if you will get your share for that day. Super mindful of people's time! \n\nOnce you are finally inside after 11:00am, you won't feel rushed to order your food at the counter. Everything is measured by the pound and sliced to order. There's plenty of seatings inside and outside. The restaurant isn't big by any means, but the flow of the line was efficient that there will be tables available when you are ready to sit down and eat. \n\nFor two people, we ordered the Ruby's Dang pie, potato salad, pinto beans, half pound of brisket, ribs, pulled pork, and jalapeño cheddar sausage. That was plenty of food, we ended up having some extra to take back. My favorite was the pie, then brisket. A close third was the jalapeño cheddar sausage. Absolutely delicious and amazing. The brisket was just the most tender meat I've had in my life. \n\nIf waiting in line is not your thing, you can always order in advance, with a minimum of 5 pounds of meat. Pick up location is in the back and is separate from the line. My friend did that, but I think she had to wait about 20-30 minutes after arriving for the order to be ready. \n\nWill definitely go back to Austin just for Franklin BBQ. Seriously!",

        "text": "There is a reason this is a legendary establishment. Well, there are actually quite a few!\n\nEvery cut of meat is at least among the best in its class. The brisket and ribs are the standard of BBQ excellence. They have almost no peers to match their balance of salt, savory, sweet, and succulent. However, let me tell you that turkey is the best turkey that I've ever had. Everyone brags about the red meats in TX, but this turkey is as good as any meat you'll eat anywhere. Do not add sauce to anything! It came without sauce because it is wonderful on its own. Try the pies for dessert. Nothing compliments the meat's savory goodness as much as a wonderfully sweet desert from a local bakery like Cake and Spoon! \n\nI've visited Franklin's a couple of times now, both on weekdays. You can comfortably arrive by 930 and be done eating by noon. That didn't used to be the case (you had to arrive by 8am) but the benefit of having so many excellent BBQ options in Austin is that it thins all lines! Any amount of waiting is worth it for this wonderful BBQ. Staff greets you in line and takes preliminary orders to predict how far their food will go. They do run out of meat so arrive early. Maybe a dozen complimentary folding chairs are available for early folks. The line is mostly under an awning and is on the west side of the building so you won't get any direct summer sun, and you'll be mostly covered by rain if you get here early enough. Parking is much harder the later you arrive.\n\nDon't eat dinner, grab a friend, get here early, make a new friend in line, and eat as much of everything on the menu as possible!",

        "text": "I read other Yelp reviews so knew what to expect. If you come around 8 am there will be 30-40 people already in line but I think that's ok. I went on a Friday and they first people got in line at 5:30 am which I don't think is worth it. I got there at 8:10 am and about 35 people ahead of me. Note there are complimentary folding chairs available under the stairs for you to use. They open the side door so you can use the bathroom and buy drinks or merchandise. \n\nA worker took our pre-order to let people know when brisket will run out. You still must place your order once you get inside. 10 minutes before the doors open at 11 am they will tell everyone to return the chairs and stand up against the wall. The doors open at 11 and you wait for the line to move. One person slices every type of meat you want so it is a slow process. Another person adds any sides you want. The cashier adds any drinks or pies plus rings you up. By the time I got my food it was 11:55 am. The workers are very friendly and the meat carver will chat with you as they slice the meats. \n\nThere are some tables inside and outside. Tables turn over relatively quickly as people realize they ordered too much like I did! I got 1/2 lb each of brisket and pork ribs. 1/4 lb each of pulled pork and turkey. The brisket was soft, moist, smokey and had a nice bark. It's everything you want from a brisket! The pork ribs were also very good being fall off the bone soft with smokey flavor. The pulled pork was ok. I prefer Hawaiian kalua pig more! The turkey had a smokey flavor with pepper outside. It wasn't dry which is always the worry with turkey. \n\nI got pinto beans on the side which were just ok. I got a bourbon banana pie but was so full I didn't get to eat it yet!\n\nIs the wait worth it? I'd say yes if you're from out of Texas and don't have access to good barbecue. If you're from Texas maybe it's not worth it as there are many other places or preorder to not have to deal with the line. \n\nIt was an expensive meal but one I don't regret! Nice to splurge and treat yourself very now and then, especially when on vacation!",

        "text": "So, we came to town from Cali and of course we had to try this place out since it was highly recommended.  We got there at 10am since there only open for 3hrs. We got there and there was already 75 people in line waiting.  This is the only time I'd wait for anything.  We heard that people got there at 8am.  It took us almost 3hrs to get in an order and sit down. The ran out of Beef Ribs.  We ordered the Turkey, Ribs, Brisket, Pork Square Ribs, Sausage (Jalapeño, Cheese) , Pulled Pork, and our sides were potato salad, Beans, and Coleslaw. \n\nBrisket, Pulled Pork, Ribs-tender, Smokey, good bark, and great flavor\nTurkey-great flavor and tender\nSausage- were not bad, Jalapeño one was much better\nPotato salad was just okay. Potato salad needed some seasoning. \nBeans were pretty good. \nColeslaw-was dry and needed some seasoning.  \n\nThe sides option was very limited, I would've love some greens or Mac n cheese which is a staple when it comes to BBQ.  \n\nThe BBQ sauces were pretty good.\n\nAt least you could get beers while you wait and they provided chairs which was awesome \n\nFor the most part it was excellent just like the staff. Kudos. \n\nI would give it 5 Stars on the meats and the service but overall because of everything I had to give it a 4stars.  I would recommend at least going to this place if your in town.  I also recommend preordering if you want buy 5 pounds or more. Hardly any wait.",

I asked the staff why and apparently the espresso is brewed and won't last when bottled. Yes, it was my favorite too.\n\nWhile you wait outside, they have water and portable chairs/umbrellas to borrow (if avail). They also sell drinks outside while you wait. \nAll the rubs, sauces, and other merch are avail inside for you to buy when you are STILL in line.",

Two workers were going down the line taking a tally of meats ppl were going to order and told us that it would be about 2 1/2 hours wait till we could even get to the counter! I thought no way hut it really did take that long! Was it worth? 1000% worth it! The Brisket was like cotton candy damn near but meat! It was INSANE! How they do that?! The ribs was falling off the bone every time i grabbed a piece! Worth the wait ! The staff was so friendly and the restaurant just had homey vibes to it! Coming back next time I'm in Austin!",

There's a staff member that informed you if there will be certain cuts of meat available to you depending on your place in line. After 2 hrs wait, i finally got to the inside. There's only space for one person to cut the meat and you are ordering from that person. That's the main reason why the line is so long. \n\nOrdered 1.5lb of beef rib, 1lb of brisket, 1lb of pork ribs, 1 pull pork sandwich, and three sausages for 3 ppl. The amount of food was a bit much, had two slices of brisket left over. I enjoyed the beef rib the most. It falls off the bone and super easy to chew. Brisket is okay. The pork ribs, pull pork and sausages were meh, nothing special or out of the ordinary. Dont think it's worth waiting 2hrs in line for average bbq.",

THE BEST of all the meats tried. Perfectly seasoned and tenderized. Easily the star of the show.\n\nBeef Rib- For all you heavy meat lovers, this is for you. The fattiness can be quite overwhelming, so best to share amongst 2-3 people\n\n\nBETTER at TERRY BLACKS:\nJalapeño sausage- Franklin sausage lacked much flavor, and was a little dry\n\nAll the sides!!- Franklin basically kicked this aspect to the curb.. don't expect much from these\n\n\nTIE:\nPork Rib- all depends what you like\n\nFranklin if you care more about meat texture- soft and fell off the bone!\n\nTerry Black if you care more about flavor- seasoning and sauce was superior\n\n\nOverall, it was quite the fun experience waiting in line and mingling with other customers. Something about waiting in line together BEFORE opening makes it more tolerable. Also thankful for the shade!\n\n\nTl; dr:\nMeat lovers- go to Franklin \n\nNo patience to wait in line and want a complete meal with sides? - go to Terry Blacks",

What a cool place and the service was excellent. What I thought was really cool was that as you're in line, the staff comes up to you and they let you know what's available or what should be available or not by the time you order. Fortunately, everything was available when we ordered. What I can tell you is that was some of the best BBQ I've ever had. As for the brisket it was the best I have ever had. What I also liked about Franklins was the location and rustic look to the place. They offer indoor and outside seating on picnic tables. I truly enjoyed Franklins and the food. Also do not miss out of the deserts that they offer. I had the Ruby's Dang Pie and it was Dang good. Unfortunately they were out of the Pecan Pie.",

        "text": "Did a takeout order for Franklin BBQ and managed to snag 2 lbs of brisket, 2 lbs of jalapeno cheddar sausage, and 1 original sausage and a quart of chopped brisket. Sadly all the pork ribs and pulled pork were out, so we didn't get to try that.\n\nTo be honest, I thought the food was pretty mediocre. My favorite was the jalapeno cheddar because the cheddar oozed out of the sausage. The brisket, which I was super excited for, was super moist, but also super salty. I preferred the dry rub ones I've had in Nashville and probably should have had bbq sauce with it, although none was included. The meat ended up sitting super heavy and salty. We had bbq the night before at a Japanese restaurant, and the group agreed that was the superior bbq. Although we were a group of 8, we didn't end up finishing any of the meat. The sides of potato salad, bbq beans, coleslaw were all okay. They also included a loaf of wonder bread.\n\nAlthough we ordered pickup and arrived before our order time, it still took 30+ mins to get our order because they slice it up on the spot. Fun for an experience but I'd feel gipped if I waited 5 hours for the food.",

        "text": "Hands down the best BBQ in all of Texas. Anyone that says otherwise (including locals) are simply wrong and say this because of the wait. If Franklins didn't have a wait, I guarantee everyone would agree this is by far the best BBQ. I tried all the top BBQ joints in Texas and Franklins took the cake by miles. Meat is cooked perfectly and has the most flavor out of all the BBQs I've tried. Perfect balance of bark, smoke, seasoning, and fat! This place is definitely worth the wait. Get in line around 730-8am and you'll be golden. There's a reason this place is so we'll known, they know what they're doing! \n\nPS: I got there at 630am on a Saturday and instantly made friends in line. The wait is part of the experience. Bring some beers and a chair and you'll have a great time waiting for the best BBQ. Around 8-830am is when the line really picks up and the risk of food selling out becomes real.",

        "text": "Review #800 for me should be something special, so let's celebrate at Franklin Barbecue! And I even got the VIP tour!\n\nYears in the wishing, I finally planned this foodie trek by myself from Cali to Texas to try Franklin Barbecue. I'm no BBQ expert, but after trying Texas Top 50 BBQ place Tyler's BBQ in Amarillo years ago, I had to come back and try more BBQ. So many strong spots on that stretch from San Antonio to Lockhart to Austin, but Franklin is where the new traditionalist movement started! \n\nTry to get there an hour before it opens and earlier on weekends and holidays. Typically you'll wait that hour plus another 60-90 minutes so total wait time could be up to 2.5 hours. I came on a Tuesday and arrived about 20 minutes before they opened at 11:00 am. Some people have lawn chairs set up for the wait and there is a place to stash them under the stairwell while you go in and eat. About 15-30 minutes before the restaurant opens, someone comes out to take your pre-order and can help you to estimate the wait time. This is not an order you have to hold hard and fast to, it is basically to get an idea of who wants what meet and at what point they might run out of certain meats. When you get to the counter inside, you can choose to do more or less meat than your original plan if you want. \n\nIt was supposed to be about 90 minutes for me to get to the counter after the restaurant opened but the line moved fast and it was only another hour. Total wait time on my Tuesday including pre-opening... 1 hour 20 minutes. Waiting in line is part of the fun. You get to meet locals and travelers and talk meat. Once inside, you can see all the other fun stuff they have for sale... BBQ Sauce, dry rub, charcoal briquets, t-shirts, hats, cookbooks, mugs, cafeteria trays and even a smoker! I picked up shirts, sauce and the sky blue cafeteria tray which I thought was a random and cool way to serve up bbq at a future house party. Did you know you can even buy refrigerated brisket slabs for $170 that are ready for you to take and bake?\n\nMeat is sold by weight, sausages are sold in whole links.\n\nBrisket ($34/lb) - If you aren't here for the brisket, then what are you doing? The brisket takes 42 hours to prepare, including 14 slow smoked hours in the smoker. That blackened crust on the outside where the peppercorns glisten like black diamonds, my God. Under that is a layer of fat that melts before you can cut it and under that is a thick, dark pink smoke ring. They cut you some of both, lean and moist (fatty) and both are wonderful. The brisket is well-seasoned, juicy and smokey and needs no BBQ sauce. \n\nPork Ribs ($30/lb) - I loved the pork rib. The whole thing was a pink smoke ring all the way through. Its brine and coat seemed more tangy than the brisket but also equally smokey and wonderful. The meat did fall off the bone after I bit into it. \n\nJalapeno Cheddar Sausage - I got this just to try something different but it blew me away. Smokey, strong jalapeno kick, juicy gobs of white cheddar oozing out on the inside as my knife broke through. Must get if you love a spicy sausage!\n\nColeslaw - This was aite. I needed some veggies to break up the meat party it. It's not heavily coated in creamy sauce so it did the job. \n\nPotato Salad - Creamy with a little mustard mixed in, I liked it. \n\nBourbon Banana Tart - They get these from Cake and Spoon and these are must get. Just take it home if you can't fit it in your stomach. Smooth banana cream with the bourbon activator that makes it full flavored. The crust was thick but crumbly and still a little graham cracker crunchy when I had it two days later. It is sooo good. \n\nBBQ Sauces - They have Original, Spicy, Vinegar, Espresso. Original was my favorite. Spicy is mildly spicy. Vinegar was too watery and sour for me. Espresso is very interesting because it is infused with coffee flavor. They did it well, but I still prefer original or spicy. Their original sauce is lightly sweet and a bit more tart than other joints' original sauce. \n\nAfter eating I ventured out back hoping to take a peek at their smokers and they said, \"Go upstairs ask them for a tour, they can probably give you one.\" WHAT the WHUT?\n\nI took myself back up to the dining room and ask if it was possible to get a tour. They said, \"Sure! Just wait outside this door.\" \n\nBy that time most people had been served and it wasn't too hectic. One of their master smokers opened the door and let me in. They have five submarine like smokers that had 106 briskets in them when I was there. They are always working on about 200 briskets at any given time, whether smoking or prepping. The room is always around 85 degrees so it's insanely hot in the summer.\n\nSo that was my awesome trip! \n\n***Hot Tip - Go at 1 pm if you only want brisket and there might be no line!***",

The ribs are amazing, lots of favor in each item. Turkey was a little dry, but it's ok.  Ordered one of each of the sausage and we wished we ordered more to take home.  I'm not big fan of the potatoes salad. We were alittle bum that the day we went they do not make beef ribs, but we will need to go back to try it.",

Locals love this place too, although some will say it's not worth the wait. My friend was adamant about coming to this specific BBQ place because he had been once before and LOVED it. We got up super early and waited in line from 8am until they opened, and then waited about 1 hour til we got to the front of the line. The line was SO long people had brought chairs to wait early in the morning.\n\nWe ordered meat and sides all to share. The meat was so tender it glides right off my fork, as it should. And so juicy & flavorful! They have 4 different sauces. My only disappointment is that they didn't have Mac n cheese! Their potatoes and beans were great though.\n\nWould recommend only if you're down to wait a long time. Some locals recommended similar BBQ places with shorter wait times, and I haven't tried those so I can't compare.",

So naturally, I was inclined.\n\nWhat these blogs failed to mention is how long the wait would be! I got there at opening and still waited 2 hours in line. One of the people working there informed us that we would likely only be served the brisket and the links based on our position in line and they were correct.\n\nIt does get very packed so I had to camp out spots and wait for people to finish eating to find a seat. When we did sit down to eat, the food was to die for! The brisket was so tender it felt like it melted on my tongue. If I had one complaint, it would be that the brisket was a little salty. \n\nOverall, if you haven't been then you definitely need to check out this Austin BBQ staple at least once!",

        "text": "I've waited in line for cronuts, Saturday Night Live, Hamilton tickets, and finally Franklin BBQ, which was perhaps the most worthwhile wait of all. \n\nThe wait:\n\nMy boyfriend and I got in line at 8:10 AM on a Friday in March 2023 and there were already 30 people in line. (We had food in hand at 11:47 AM.) People quickly started showing up behind us. They give out chairs and bottles of water, making for one of the most luxurious waiting experiences I've ever had. \n\nThe food:\n\nThey take your meat order while on line, and you add sides, pies, etc at the counter. We opted for:\n\n+ Brisket - 3/4 lb\n+ Ribs - 1/2 lb\n+ Sausage - 1 link\n+ Potato salad - single \n+ Slaw - single\n+ Pinto beans - single \n+ Key lime pie \n+ Strawberry rhubarb pie\n+ Free pickles\n\nThe brisket was obviously the best thing we ate, and definitely the most incredible brisket I've ever had. Other standouts were the sausage, potato salad and strawberry rhubarb pie. Don't sleep on the free pickles, either! It was more than enough food for the two of us, and we even had some leftovers. \n\nWe also went on the pit tour after we ate, which was awesome.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nSo so worth it!",

We got the brisket, smoked turkey, pulled pork, ribs, and their jalapeno cheddar sausage links. Comes with slices of wonder bread and they have a sauces and pickles on the side. Food by the pound. All of it was great. You could see the smoke rings. Wasn't a fan of the turkey but I imagine it would be much better if it was sliced a bit thinner. The link were great but the casing was a bit tough. All of the meat is carved in front of you. As we were leaving we heard one of the guys telling people waiting in line that they were going to be sold out of the brisket by the time they got to order. \n\nIts a tiny place, if you want brisket, get here early. We were a group of 7, we didn't finish our plate so we took it all home and I won't lie - it was better the second time around when we made mini sliders.",

We waited about 3 hours total from the time we got to the restaurant to our table (which is pretty standard for Franklin). \n\nFor a party of 5 we ordered 2lb pork ribs, 2.5lbs brisket, 1lb sausage and .5lb turkey, quart of coleslaw, pint of bean and pint of potato salad and it was more than enough! Plenty of leftovers which is always welcomed. \n\nAgain the rib really shined, it was everyone's favorite by far and the perfect amount of spice/fat and fell right off the bone. The brisket is really great but I don't know if it is truly the best in Austin. The spicy sausage had the perfect snap to it and was absolutely delicious. All sauces were great and really made the meal. \n\nOnly down side is the sides. A BBQ place without mac n cheese is a crime in my book. Between that and the long wait that you can avoid at other places I gave it 4/5 but realistically a 4.5/5, you won't regret the wait it is truly delicious.",

        "text": "This is legit the best brisket! And the other food looked just as delicious. The choices of sauces were good too! \n\nWe're in town for work and had to go here. We went to Terry Blacks last trip. So, it was Fraklins this trip. And it was life changing brisket. How do they make meat taste like buttery melt in your mouth goodness? Literally, this has been the highlight of the trip so far. Because of course the first weekend here they would be on that whole ice storm watch. \n\nThe line is legit, y'all,and we came at like 10:30. I realize they're going for authentic and originality with the set-up. But that food is so good they can move the kitschy roadside barbecue joint into an upgrade to accommodate more space inside. Like don't upgrade the smokers. Just upgrade or enlarge the restaurant area. \n\nWhile you wait look at the roof near the door. Next to the sign that says \"road-trip\" someone wrote \"kill more cows I want beef ribs\". That's because by the time it got to us there were no more beef ribs, and I think I heard a collective moan at this announcement. What is it like they only have ten beef ribs each weekend day? C'mon, make more beef ribs! The people's trays with the beef ribs I saw looked so good! I was even considering Hunger Games style contest for the beef ribs! \n\nThe entire experience was legit. The smoke ring and seasoning on the brisket were the stuff legends are made of. I got a subscription to Master Class for Christmas, and now I'm going to watch the Franklin's guy's class. And by the way he was there today! This is a work trip and if this is the highlight of the trip I am count this as successful!",

They have one counter trying to serve 100s of people who are waiting in 100 degree weather. They don't have misters outside or anything like that (which plenty of bars nearby do) and they don't even bother dusting the couple of fans that they have outside so they are caked with dead skin cells and bacteria. With how much money they are charging and by effect making they should be able to make the conditions people are waiting in much better in my opinion. \n\nWith that being said the brisket was hands down the best brisket I've ever had in my life, holy shit it was so good. The ribs and the jalapeño sausage was also top tier. I personally didn't like any of the barbecue sauces (too vinegary for my taste) but my friends liked them. \n\nOverall the bbq was amazing but I personally won't be coming here during the summer heat because of their lack of accommodations for people waiting in line. But I'd definitely come back when it's not so hot outside.",

Pick up was a breeze because we got the meat before they're even opened. \n\nWe ordered: brisket, pork rib, pulled pork, original links, jalapeños links. \n\nThe brisket was so moist, even the flats are moist. I ordered 2lbs. Are 3 slices and took the rest back to La lol. \n\nThe pork rib is something I don't really care for. Maybe it'll be better once I take it back home. \n\nPulled pork was wonderful. It was super soft and juicy. Paired great with that vinegar sauce. \n\nBoth of the links were pretty good too. I'm not usually a links type of girl. \n\nAll these food came with a whole loaf of bread. \n\nThe bourbon banana tart was a great as a midnight snack. I was too full to attempt to eat it on the same sitting. \n\nThe coleslaw was a fail. It was quite flavorless.",

        "text": "I know this might trigger some, but I felt really let down by the hype surrounding Franklins. Came to TX intent on chowing down on some mind blowing bbq, and honestly, this wasn't it.\n\nWe drove in from Dallas specifically for Franklins. We were aware of the line and pre-ordered our meal so we could have a picnic. Pickup was between 12:30-1:00 and there was a line outside when we pulled up. \nFor pre-orders, there is a trailer down the hill and behind the main restaurant. Despite the numerous warnings of not being able to eat pre-orders on site, there is a small, shaded patio with 2 picnic tables right next to the pickup area. \n\nWe ordered: \n- 2lbs of ribs\n- 2 sausage link (1 of each)\n- 1 lbs pulled pork\n-2 lbs. sliced brisket\n-all of their sides: pinto beans, potato salad and slaw\n\nOur thoughts:\n- the sides were horrible, surprisingly had absolutely no flavor and bland\n- brisket, although the bark was good; it was way too overdone and literally turned into mush the minute I ate it. I get that eventually my diet will be much softer but I while I still have my teeth I like being able to chew my food. \n- sausage: actually flavorful but overall dry\n- pulled pork: super stringy and dry\n-ribs: again, way overcooked and literally fell apart on the fork. But not in a good way\n\nService:\n-staff was super friendly and was able to add in a loaf of bread to our order last minute",

        "text": "First time coming to Austin so of course the 1st meal had to be Texas bbq. After doing some research we picked this place. The line wasn't bad according to some locals that were in the line but it still took an hour for us to get the foods. It's because there's only 1 meat cutter. We ordered some brisket, pork ribs, jalapeños cheddar sausage link, and 1 pecan pie. The pie was really good, perfect sweetness and crunchiness. For the meat, it's actually our first time eating Texas BBQ style meat so I'm rating only based on my preference, not on how they are supposed to taste. Surely the meat was tender and juicy but they were a little bit salty for us. Luckily the condiments helped balance them a little bit but we usually need some kind of sweetness in bbq meats. And the whole meal cost us $90 so it was quite a disappointment for us. But one great thing is everyone here was super nice and friendly.",

For the folks who were lined up past the building the staff was nice and kind to bring out umbrellas for those who didn't have one. Once we got inside wow the smell of BBQ was so worth it. Sadly they already ran out of the big beef rib. We ended up getting ribs, brisket which was my favorite and some pulled pork.

        "text": "Here's my take on it, just like everyone says, plan ahead and get there early.  As there is a heat wave going on, you're better off trying to get there so you can secure some shade for yourself. \n\nI'll admit, the line process isn't as good as you'd think, however, everyone ahead and behind is super kind and you have to go with it.  I noticed that there was a group of 4 guys and then it suddenly turned into a group of at least 10 people when their friends started showing up, which I suppose is a common thing now?\n\nI arrived at 750am and waited until the restaurant opened which was probably another hour in line after it opened.  They open at 11:00am but depending on the wait you're still standing afterwards.\n\nOne thing I was impressed by was the amount of foldable/camping chairs located underneath the stairs due to the long wait prior to opening their doors.  And, everyone pretty much put them back where they got them from, that is unless you brought your own chair! \n\nIt was fun being a part of this experience and they have a small shop for souvenirs. \n\nWe ordered the tri tip, brisket, turkey, pulled pork and a beef rib (which btw, is only a weekend serving and they run out fast)!  We ordered more than enough where we had shared with a sibling of mine. \n\nThere are signs posted everywhere stating you cannot take a table unless you've ordered your food and we were lucky to find a table on the inside as Austin is going through a heatwave.  I will say that I enjoyed their spicy sauce.   oh, their cole slaw was pretty good. \n\nWould I go here again?  Yes.  Would I wait as long as I did, no... but we would go back for sandwiches and dessert.",

        "text": "Wooow love me some Good Texas BBQ !!\n\nWe were in Austin for a conference and we had to hit up a local spot since everyone we talk to told us we just had to come here early in the morning .. reminds me of Wilenski's in MTL they are only open from 11-3pm and if you show up late you might end up with crumbs ... they sell out very fast\n\nAs we got here there was already a huge line up before they even opened and there was at least 50 people before us wow but the line goes fast\n\nWe decided to get the classics for Texas (Roast beef, pulled pork sandwich and beef ribs And some sides )\n\n10/10 for the food it was just that amazing totally worth it and more. However I did prefer Terry Black's over Franklin's but I had to try both they were both amazing \nPickles and onions are Free on the sides and all their sauces and all the tea you can drink \n\nI wish they were open later at night \n\nService: Super nice and friendly true southern charm everyone's super nice and Howdy the place is very authentic to Texas and welcoming down to earth vibe\n\nOverall : I definitely recommend this place if you're in Austin you must must give it a try !",

They sold out of the sliced brisket a couple people before me in line but I was able to snag 2 of their lunch trays for $40. Such a great deal because it was my first time there so I was able to try a variety of their meats (chopped brisket, pulled pork, turkey, and sausage). It kept me fed for over a week lol",

        "text": "This brisket was legendary. Best brisket I've ever had. Although I do feel like my expectations were so astronomically high that I was disappointed that the brisket wasn't mindblowingly good. It was a little less than that. Nonetheless I was very satisfied. It had a nice smoke ring around the edges and the insides were so moist. The edges are my favorite part, and they were so well-seasoned and flavorful. \n\nWe came at 2:15pm on a Friday and the line wasn't too bad. They were out of some meats, but still had brisket, sausage, and pulled pork. We were actually the second to last people in line and they ran out of brisket on the last person. Really friendly service!",

        "text": "On the logistics, I got in line at 7:15am yesterday, was about 13th in line and was at the counter at 11:30am.  Was as expected.  Doors open at 9:30am for you to buy merch and use the bathrooms.  If you are waiting in line with a friend, I took a break around 9am and walked 5 minutes down the street for coffee at a coffee shop called \"Try Hard\" and that helped break up the time.  \n\nOn the food, the brisket met my expectations.  Had a nice smoke ring and was very tender.  My favorite pairing was with the spicy bbq sauce.  The vinegar sauce was second best.  The original sauce was boring.  I also read somewhere not to sleep on the turkey.  That was probably the best turkey I've ever eaten.  It's so juicy and when they cut it they dip it into this juice bath right before serving so it glistens.\n\nThe only letdown, and the reason I knocked off a star, was the pork ribs.  Like some of the other Yelp reviews say (and I wish I had read before going), they were so salty I couldn't eat them.  For the other meats you can taste the meat, but for the pork ribs, you are just hit with salt.  \n\nOn how much food to order.  1 lb of brisket was perfect for two.  If you want leftovers, do 1 and 1/4 or 1 and 1/2 lbs.  We ordered half a pound of turkey, would recommend getting 3/4 lbs.  And we got 1 lb of the pork ribs which was 5 bones.  We had two slices of brisket and just the ribs leftover.\n\nEnjoyed the experience waiting in line, but probably wouldn't wait again for it now that I've had it.  It's good and worth the wait the first time.  But it's not *that* much better than some other places that don't have a wait.",
