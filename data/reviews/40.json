Me and my friend came here late at night and they stop seating at 10:15, and we prolly got there at 10:12 but the bartender GAREN was ahmazing. He recommended the lobster the crab and a side of risotto and he hit the nail on the head. It was to die for! Highly recommend.  We would come back JUST for Garen. He hooked us up and gave us the best service!",

        "text": "Let me start off by saying I love love love the decor and the vibe here. Gave very Tulum in Atlanta . It's a dark restaurant that is very strict against flash photography & the waitresses will not hesitate in telling you. This is where they lost me because the waitress explained it as an African fusion place that has seasonal menus. Didn't really get African food from menu items (ex sushi& other Asian dishes) the drinks were great and the shrimp tempura rolls I got were very satisfying. I also got the dessert at fruit in a chocolate cup which was super good but the chocolate was so bitter it wasn't enjoyable. Overall would suggest going for the experience but not something I see myself going back to just to go",

        "text": "Yebo's updated location is larger and even trendier than its prior one. Their outdoor area is particularly charming, replete with heat lamps and see-and-be-seen guests who are happen to be frequenting the space on any given night. We, however, dined indoors.\n\nLots of interesting options on the menu. We had the wild mushroom soup, which was unique in and of itself given the foamy element incorporated into the texture. Truffle oil + shiitake mushroom gave it a daring flair. The ostrich sliders are understandably in the appetizer section, though they are perhaps more filling than they look. The classic Caesar salad and harvest salad provided for a healthy option, and if you'd prefer to be healthy, I'd certainly recommend it, though I've had tastier salads. The halibut tasted fantastic, as did the curried cauliflower. Regarding desserts, to be honest, I was slightly underwhelmed with the pumpkin cheesecake and milk chocolate hazelnut selections...they weren't bad...just not as delectable as I might have anticipated.\n\nService was great, though our water was left unfilled for quite some time. Other than that, they were friendly and helpful.",

        "text": "I joined some family and friends here recently and everyone enjoyed themselves. The new location is beautiful and has a nice courtyard. For starters, we ordered the crab dip, shrimp tempura roll and the bobotie crepes. All of the appetizers were delicious , but the bobotie crepes stood out because it isn't something I'd typically order, but they were really good. The crepes are filled with curry ground beef, raisins, apples and hollandaise. My cocktail, camps bay was really tasty as well. It contained rum and bourbon. For my entree, I chose the Branzino. It was so fresh and flavorful. We ordered a variety of desserts including the strawberry cheesecake, key lime pie and crème brûlée. They were good, not great. I wish they'd bring back the Amarula cheesecake from their old location. It's one of the best desserts I've ever had. \n\nEveryone enjoyed their food and the service was excellent. Looking forward to returning.",

I noticed the inside had a very cozy and intimate vibe, dimly lit, as I scoped the scene as we waited to be walked to our table outdoors. Perfect for a date night. The outdoor seating area made me feel like I was on vacation with the trees and tents, like a beach vacation dinner. To start I ordered the tuna roll. For my entree, I ordered the lamb chops they weren't bad once I reheated them at home aka cooked them more, I've definitely had better. My friend ordered the pasta and she said it was very bland which is why she kept drenching it in cheese, she gave it a 6/10. My friend enjoyed her salad + salmon. My other friend ordered the mussels and she seemed to enjoy them as well. We ordered the tiramisu and the cheesecake. I'm not a huge sweets person, but I do love a good cheesecake, this one was pretty good. I didn't taste the tiramisu but they demolished it so I guess it was good. The service was okay, server was pretty forgetful but very sweet.",

        "text": "I would absolutely 100% come back here again! The decor and ambiance is beautiful, the wait staff is attentive, and the food was perfectly prepared.\n\nWe went as a party of 6, two adults with four little people in tow. To be clear: this is not a restaurant that gives you the sense it's child-friendly. We went midday on Saturday so the restaurant wasn't packed and we didn't have to feel like we were spoiling every other adult's fun by having the children there.\n\nAlmost immediately, the 10 and 12 year old both decided they would prefer fast food after we left. Spoiler alert: all children happily ate off the appetizers and our plates.\n\nHere's what we had:\n*Branzino - it was cooked well but not seasoned. Our favorite branzino experiences are places that marinate it; it comes out very flavorful that way. This one was served with a cilantro jalapeño sauce that was absolutely necessary to have it taste anything other than plain and bland.\n\n*Chef's special that had Cornish hen, rice pilaf, and broccolini. It was supposed to come with peri peri sauce but i asked for that on the side to control for spice level. It came with both that and the natural au jus from the \"chicken\" on the side. The au jus was actually very spicy even though the chicken wasn't. Everything on the plate was cooked well, but the broccolini was really just the tops of the broccolini and there were only 3 pieces on the plate.. Both the 1yo and 3yo ate the chicken and rice with no complaints. \n\n*Crispy brussel sprouts served with aioli. If you like brussel sprouts (and i do!) there's nothing to complain about here. They were definitely fried crispy and they were a salted well.\n\n *Fries cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection, served with ketchup and aioli. This was the favorite dish of the 1yo, and the older children ate it too.\n\n*Butternut squash soup. It was creamy and delicious and my 3yo ate half of it. \n\nBecause we were out on a family adventure, I didn't try anything from the drink menu. There were a few small groups of ladies out brunching in cute outfits and full faces. I'd definitely come back all dolled up and enjoy some drinks and dinner!",

The staff were very friendly and recommended trying the Bobotie crepe which consisted of curry beef with raisins and apple slices. The flavor palette was sweet and savory. I also tried the Brussel sprouts and the portion was big enough to share. I really enjoyed my quick drop in and order dinner to go. This restaurant gives you all the feels and is very IG worthy.

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly and made sure we were good and had everything we needed during our entire experience. She made recommendations and really helped us make good decisions on the dishes we chose. I had the salmon and it was delicious. I love olives and capers so this was right up my alley. If you don't they do provide you with the option to remove them or have the sauce on the side. One friend order the lamb chops and I tried a piece of it. It was very tender and seasoned well. I didn't get to try to swordfish it my friend really enjoyed it. We had zero left overs from this meal lol. \n\nAlso, there is free parking and the venue is nice and reminds you of being in a garden outside with the fountain. Great for photos if your into that. We dined outside because the weather was nice but they also offer indoor seating of course. \n\nWill definitely return to try other dishes.",

The menu has something for everyone.\n\nWe ordered a few appetizers: mussels, spicy tuna roll, fries, burrata, and ostrich sliders - everything was excellent and the ostrich sliders tasted like beef as our server had advised; a very lean and flavorful beef.\n\nThe cocktails and wines that were suggested we also very good :)\n\nI don't remember all the meals but everyone enjoyed them. My only complaint was that my branzino while flavorful had a lot of bones. Based on my question on preparation I expected maybe a few but they did get in the way of me enjoying my meal.

I sent them back, the 2nd time still overcooked. The waitress never came back to even check. My spousd ordered the Halibut, it was cold  and lacked the normal flavor it usually has. Given all this going wrong,  no manager ever comes and checks on us. Then to top it off, once she brings the bill she stuff we never even ordered and had an attitude when we showed it to her on the bill. I'm not sure if it was our late time coming or what. But our dinner yesterday, was by far one of my worst dinning experience. I won't be going back",

The nerve of the manager to tell me to eat under the skin. Fool! The skin is the best part. They gave me half off my meal. Overall enjoyable, I'll try again.",

Nothing stood out for me. The sprite was even watered down. I swapped the Shirley Temple (Sprite + grenadine) for a lemonade which was ok. I did have the vanilla gelato was good though. \n\nTo be fair, my friend loved her oysters and cauliflower. So maybe it was my choice in food. \n\nThe service and atmosphere was great. The server was super friendly and responsive. The atmosphere is cool and laidback. Everything was clean. \n\nThe parking is pretty convenient. Not a ton of parking spaces but enough to find a spot (at least during an early lunch). \n\nPrices are pretty high for the quality of food I received. I expected the prices but expected the food to be better. \n\nOverall I think this place is probably good for some, just not for me.",

We spent a pretty penny but it was worth it. \n\nExperience: 10/10\nLoved the service! Our server, Tiffony was exceptional. The decor is gorgeous. The inside table has pillows which were a nice touch. It was pretty chilly inside especially if you were seated right under a vent but it didn't take too much away from the experience.\n\nFood: 10/10\nThe food was absolutely amazing. We started with the cheesy crab dip, ostrich sliders, and shrimp tempura.

Our servers Tiffany and Jonathan were great at giving recommendations and truly catered to our every need. The only thing I would recommend for those going with a big party is to make sure everyone shows up on time or else you will have to wait for your entire group to arrive before being seated. And also get there before 9 pm because they get really packed around that time. The ambiance was great as well. Really cute decor and vibes as well.",

The taste of curry goes surprisingly good with the ground beef in it. I'd definitely visit again for this crepe! The whole branzino and the cocktails are also so delicious, but just not as outstanding as the crepe. The only thing I am not very satisfied with was the hummus. It's not even as good as some deli place. But generally this restaurant is really good! And I also love the vibe and decoration. It's definitely a wonderful choice for a decent date night.",

The outside patio is gorgeous with all of the plants around, and the inside varies depending on if it's a summery beach house or a cute Christmas ski lodge. \n\nFor four of us, we started with the shrimp tempera rolls with peri peri sauce. Nothing to rave about, but a good start to the meal.\n\nThe stars of the show were the main entrees. I had the special lamb shank and my boyfriend had the bolognese. The lamb was cooked perfectly and it was fall off the bone tender. I tried a bit of the bolognese as well and I loved the homemade sauce and the ostrich ragu.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the opera cake with a little bit of raspberry sorbet. The cake was perfect and I loved the little balls of espresso! Overall, Yebo is upscale and we spent over $100 on the meal, but it was totally worth it!",

The cocktail, appetizer, entree, ambiance and service was excellent; I can't wait to go back and try more items from their menu and experience the transformation that takes place during the winter season.\n \nAmbiance - you will feel like you're in a chic beach bungalow, the restaurant and outside courtyard are beautifully decorated.\n \nService - I was immediately greeted by the hostess and received a recommendation to get a drink at the bar while I waited for my party. Our waiter provided five star service, he made recommendations, kept our water glasses filled, and was very thoughtful.\n \nFood - the restaurant fuses South African flavors with New American cuisine. I ordered:\nFrittura Mista appetizer - $18. Perfectly fried halibut, calamari, prawns served with peri-peri aioli.\nHalibut - $32 a nice portion fish in a red butter curry sauce on top of coconut rice with a side of grilled broccolini. I added a little peri-peri sauce to my fish and it was absolutely delicious.\nDessert - I can't recall the name but it was a cheesecake and it was so-so, I would not order it again, not a fan of the texture.\nCocktail - well-made Rosita - $14",

It holds About 20-25 people. There was a long table that we sat at. There was a main waiter and he was awesome. I didn't get a chance to ask for anything before he was already bringing it or asking me. He was knowledge about the food and beverage menu which was helpful for my first visit. It's a little loud with the music and chatter but was ok in the private room. In general the restaurant is not big but there's lots of different types of seating from 2 top to small groups and the bar. There is also an outdoor, enclosed area with heat lamps as needed. The birthday dinner was family style so I got to taste alot of the menu. Everything was great. Flavors were right on, not too much, not to little. My fave was the ceasar salad, bootie  crepe, and halibut. The dessert was lacking, kinda just there. My wine that was recommended by the waiter (I don't like dry) was luscious. An aside, the bathrooms are very nice with a \"yebo\" candle in each which I had to purchae! I recommend everyone coming here. I can't wait to go back and share with friends.",

        "text": "This is the cutest yet lowkey spot! I was recommended by a friend and I'm so glad I went! There's both indoor and outdoor and the scenery for both is 10/10!\n\nI came with a group of 8 at 4pm, with a reservation. If you're coming as a group, I highly recommend getting one! I believe if you have a group bigger than 9 you may request the private room for events and the likewise.\n\nFirst, I'd love to give a shout out to our waiter Jamal! It was our first time eating here and he made choosing the right dish so much easier. 10/10 service :)\n\nI ordered the Halibut, but I believe the usual fish they serve with it was unavailable at the time and was replaced with sea bass. Nonetheless, it was great! The curry was seasoned well and went great with the coconut rice and broccolini. Was definitely filling!\n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back here! Great vibes and great food!",

        "text": "My wife and I visited Yebo Beach Haus to celebrate our 3-year anniversary. I've had this restaurant bookmarked for quite some time, so I felt it was the perfect time to make a trip. \n\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere is AMAZING. I'll be honest, it didn't even feel like we were in Atlanta. It gave very much Miami/LA vibes. We ate outside, which looked even better than the inside. My only issue was my wife and I both got bit by mosquitoes. It would be nice if they have some sort of repellent in the vicinity. Attire is business casual, so don't come inside half stepping on your fashion. This is in Buckhead, so come dressed to impress. \n\nParking: Though the website says self-parking and valet, I only noticed valet when we arrived. There's no price for valet, but of course, it is only right to tip.\n\nService: The service was great! I will say, it seemed to be a delay with our food, but it was pretty busy, so it was fine. The staff's friendliness made up for it. \n\nFood: For the appetizer, we ordered the FRITTURA MISTA - $16 (lightly breaded halibut / calamari / prawns / peri-peri aioli). SUPER GOOD! Glad our waiter recommended it. For dinner, I ordered the WHOLE BRANZINO - $40 (grilled leeks / grilled asparagus / lemon / cilantro jalapeño sauce). It was so good! The grilled flavor was amazing! This was my first time having fish with the bones & head still attached. It was definitely an experience. I had to take a quick trip to YouTube to see how to successfully de-bone a cooked fish. Lol. The grilled asparagus were good as well. I also ordered the House Cut Fries - $9. So damn delicious! If you like fries, I highly recommend. \n\nOverall, I loved our dining experience at Yebo Beach Haus.",
