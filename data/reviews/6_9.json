So\nDisappointed at this lackadaisical \"hospitality\" and made me wonder why. Immediate turn off. Food was good. Nothing to be exuberant about. The short ribs were tender and delicious commensurate with its price point. The wait staff was attentive and professional, even if clearly performative. For example they ask if you want sparkling, still or tap water. We opted for still (that means you pay). So they brought and opened the first bottle. Poured 18-oz tall glasses full, then had to open a second bottle to finish filing up the glasses for the three of us. The appetizer spread was cool. Again, nothing to be excited about. Will I return? No... don't think so. Sigh.",

Random nice lady saw the frustration in my face and proceeded to take our drinks and food order. Eventually our server came and greeted us. I ordered the tasting tree because I'm so indecisive. The calamari was cold and I could live with out the spring rolls. But the Lamb chops saved the day. So tender and flavorful. Beautiful restaurant and scenery Overall 3.5/5.",

Atmosphere was relaxed. \n\nWe ordered the the tasting tree, which was presented beautifully. The calamari was the real star of the show especially with the sauce on it, and some other dishes were lacking but it was great to have a good taste of all the appetizers.\n\nMy mom ordered the seafood special of the day, which she said tasted amazing. The scallops were huge and cooked very well, with a very smooth texture and a tasty sauce on top. My boyfriend ordered the curry special of the day and the curry was very fragrant and had a vibrant taste. The meat was so tender it felt like butter. I ordered the Kung Pad Thai, which tasted absolutely fantastic. The lobster was tender and the pad thai was well seasoned and beautifully presented.\n\nWe ordered the dark chocolate mousse with Thai ice cream, which was small but very rich. Sort of average. They gave us free lychee ice cream which tasted so good.\n\nWill come back soon!",

It's plenty of parking in their lot. As you walk-in you are greeted by the hostess. I was seated at the table and we ordered a bottle of wine and a few yummy appetizers, the Calamari was crunchy and yummy and the Shrimp Wraps were too. My main entree was the Scallops with Pineapple fried rice and my party ordered Salmon with the Pineapple rice and Lobster with the Pineapple Rice.  All of the entrees were delicious and was served with this yummy braised sauce on all of the plates. It was a very delicious meal. The food was brought out by the manager and kitchen staff and the waitress was very attentive. It was a light crowd because it was lunch time and I heard that's the best time with a reservation not that crowded. We enjoyed the experience and I would definitely come back again.",

        "text": "Most definitely avoid if you're looking to celebrate a special occasion or looking for \"fine dining.\" The place has gone downhill from when we used to patronize it years back. It's a commercial restaurant now that doesn't value customer experience whatsoever! I was there for my birthday, which the server asked us about when he greeted us upon seating. He was nice but clearly not at all a seasoned or trained staffer - didn't know anything about food options, suggestions, what veggies go in what (literally listed all veggies under the sun and then repeated this information incorrectly when asked again because he was confusing. Clearly he had no idea). The food was mediocre at best. The curry I ordered was excessively sweet and practically inedible. Cherry on top - the waiter totally forgot about the birthday and asked us if we wanted to see a dessert menu before bringing us the check.  When I left to use the washroom, my husband told me later that he reminded the waiter that we were celebrating a bday. He then disappeared for a while trying to put this together and made us wait for what seemed like forever. What ultimately came out was an embarrassing scoop of commercial ice cream with a candle. We didn't even bother with it at all at this point. To top off this horrendous night, we handed the \"free valet\" $10 and this GUY LITERALLY COERCED US INTO TIPPING HIM $20 and would not let us leave till we found this amount of cash. The entire thing was So unprofessional.",

We were sat quickly by the hostess and immediately met by our waitress who was patient, knowledgeable of the menu, and very kind. The atmosphere is definitely fine dining but not at all overwhelming nor pretentious. The food: absolutely delicious. Classic Thai: flavorful, spiced, and fresh. My wife ordered the \"surf & turf\" which was perfectly cooked lamb chops and lobster. I opted for the lamb shank and rice dish. Portions were big so come hungry but this did not compromise the quality of the meal. I definitely recommend Nan for an experience. The owner also came around and made sure we were enjoying ourselves. It really was a great experience.",

        "text": "Took my family here for father's day. Their first time. My second time.\nWe started out with the Lychee Martinis because lawddd it's like making love in a drink. Shrimp spring rolls and pork egg rolls. No complaints. My favorite part is that they have a legit children's menu. None of that nuggets / fries stuff. My daughter ordered shrimp tempura roll and she approved. Then followed by the kids shrimp with noodles, sun got chicken with rice\n It definitely filled them up. Last time I came I got the short Rib and licked my fingers  so I had to get them again DUH. That fried egg is a nice touch. Husband order shrimp temp roll and tuna roll. Enough to fill him up. He had a Japanese whiskey I forgot to photograph but it was aged 12 years. Smooth but powerful. They have an overall amazing drink menu and delicious food. My main take away is that they offer authentic  children friendly dishes. Of course, your children need to have a diverse pallette. It ain't no chicken tender and fries  Also we sat outside. The weather was Gorgeous and the kids walked across the street to play at city springs. Great location. Kyle was our server and was very pleasant along with the hostess as well. Super chill vibes.",

As I've said before, you know it's good when you forget to even take pictures of the food (and trust me, they plate the food really beautifully). Let's get right into why you must visit ASAP.\n\nAppetizers: \n1. Satay Kai ($10) - Grilled chicken breast bamboo skewers, red curry peanut sauce, cucumber salad. Delicious!\n\n2. Poh Pia Thod ($9) - Crispy rice paper rolls, cellophane noodles, cabbage, carrot, pineapple chili sauce. Delicious!\n\nSoup:\n\nTom Kha (Forgot last word) - Coconut galangal lemongrass broth, chicken, young coconut meat, shiitake and straw mushroom. The young coconut meat was such a pleasant surprise. This soup is really tasty! A must try!\n\nEntree:\n\nPla Yang Prik Khing ($28) - Grilled salmon, roasted red curry paste, green bean, jasmine rice. PHENOMENAL! And the salmon was cooked perfectly. I mean truly, every single dish was a hit!\n\nI didn't get dessert but I can't wait to return and I will be ordering dessert next time as well! Their menu is very thoughtful and literally each dish sounded amazing. \n\nThere is valet parking available (or you can self park for $5 (price may vary).\n\nREALLY, REALLY ENJOYED MY TIME HERE. It is fine dining, so I'd highly recommend not wearing super casual attire here. Everyone during the lunch hour was in business attire.",

The hosts were very friendly and my waiter had great vibes and was very knowledgeable of the menu! My friends and I ordered the Lychee Martini and the Mai Tai for our drinks, which were very good! We ordered the appetizer tower, which is a sampler of all the appetizers and everything was delicious! I ordered the lamb shank curry with a side of crispy okra, which was phenomenal!! My friends ordered the scallops and the sea bass and they loved their meals as well! I highly recommend going to Nan for any occasion and I can't wait to go back!",

        "text": "**3.5 stars**\n\nWe laid our eyes on Nan a while ago, but we just now got to it. We were distracted by the other Thai restaurant we've been to (and our go to) and so we set this place as one of our last fancy restaurant to go to as a married couple for 2019. \n\nWhile Nan puts itself up in the upper/higher class types of restaurant, you must ask yourself if it's really worth it. In my opinion, the food is good and the service, but because it's on the upper tier of the price range and in comparison to other restaurants you can go to for the same price... I just don't think it separates itself. I'm also a little bit more critical, especially when it comes to paying higher prices for food/service. \n\nAnd to be honest, I've had better Thai in Atlanta. The service is right there, but the food is better and it's cheaper (not too much cheaper, but cheaper nonetheless). So let's talk about food and what I had during my visit. \n\nFor starting drinks, I tried their specialty cocktail mango Mai tai. It was sweet, pretty strong, and a wonderful drink. I would recommend this if you're looking for something sweet. The other item that caught my eye was the lychee martini. \n\nFor appetizers, we had two Tom Yum soups and Larb Kai:\n\nThe Tom Yum I felt like was pretty disappointing. It was sour up top, but after drinking to the bottom, it was spicy. It felt like it wasn't mixed well with the heat and sourness. I didn't taste the spicy and sour in every bite, how Tom Yum should be. The only way I can describe it is that it's spicy, but keeps your mouth salivating for the next bite. And I've only had 2 places in my life that gave me that feeling. \n\nThe Larb Kai was okay as well. It had a little bit of heat, but it wasn't the heat that I look for in Thai food. For this I compared to the Larb Kai I had (that similarly priced) in San Francisco. And while the portion was average, it was just okay. I think it was a little sweet, but I was expecting heat and just that flavor mixed with the heat. Anyways, yeah it just didn't cut it to amaze me. \n\nFor entrees, I ordered the braised lamb shank. The wife got the Dover sole fish which was flashed fried with minced chicken on top. We also got the basil fried rice (we thought it was a side, as our waitress asked us if we wanted any sides and suggested this one). \n\nThe lamb shank had good flavor. Again, I think they went towards the sweet route as the curry didn't have any heat to it however the shank itself was great. Super fall off the bone tender meat, and just floating above the meat for you to dip and eat. \n\nThe Dover fish, well from my bite it wasn't bad.\n\nLastly the basil fried rice, was a little egregious. It was a meal that we ordered, it was $22 and really had nothing in it other than the basil and some green peppers. It was soaked/cooked in coconut milk and so the sweetness was there. There's no meat in it or anything memorable. It was good, but it was also sweet. I felt this dish was extremely not worth the price. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Thai tea créme brulée. This was pretty cool, on telling our waitress that it was going to be shared, they served it in a long tubular dish (check the pics if that was confusing). The dessert was good, sweet because it's Thai tea. If you never had Thai tea, it's comparable to southern sweet tea but better (in my opinion). I would still say that it's worth getting and trying it out. \n\nOverall, service was great. The food was good, but I think there's better in both taste and price when it comes to Thai food in Atlanta. Nan errs on the location, so keep that in mind if you decide to come here. If you're a foodie looking for the best Thai food, in my opinion, Nan doesn't make it for me. If it's service with a wider variety of okay Thai food, this place should make the list to try.",

        "text": "I had this place on my Restaurant \"Bucket List\" for a while as I had heard good reviews. I made reservations for my wife and I in celebration of our 20th Wedding Anniversary. I wanted the full experience so we ordered the \"Nan' Tasting Tree\" which is an assortment of appetizer that includes crispy calamari, chicken satay, crispy spring rolls, chicken and shrimp dumplins and a salad roll all with it's respective sause. Each appetizer had a distinct taste and they were all DELICIOUS.\n\nWe proceeded to order our entree meals. My wife ordered the the Shrimp Pad Thai and I ordered the Lamb Shank. My wife expressed being satisfied with the portion and how tasty her meal was. I on the other hand can say that this was the best Lamb Shank i've ever had (I was trying it for the first time) and it's a dish I recommend. The Lamb was so tender that the meat fell off the bone ! It's surrounded by a pineapple, coconut sauce with pieces of diced potatoes. This sauce had a sweet and sour taste which blended really well with the white rice that comes along with this dish. It was really tastefull. A cucumber salad comes aboard as well. My mouth is watery just reminiscing about it !\n\nWe concluded with dessert. We had the Coconut Cake as well as the Coconut Ice Cream. Good stuff ! \n\nOur waitress (Cristina) was so kind and helpful in explaing each dish and the drinks they had available. Same can be said by each staff member. Every staff member we made eye contact with greeted us is with such kindness. \n\nGreat staff, great ambiance, nice setting for a romantic dinner and great food ! Fine dinning at it's best.",

The waitress are on standby to assist you with any questions. The design and layout of the restaurant spacious and has a royal vibe to it. The food is $$$$ however it is worth it. I had the spring rolls , Tom Yum soup, and Kung pad Thai and out of all 3 my favorite was the soup!!  It was a different color from your usual Tom Yum Soup red both, it was soft peach color. But if still had that delicious tangy but creamy taste as a Tom Tum soup. Excellent food and excellent service .",

Thankfully the server told us that we could get the vegetarian dishes but it would have been better if they had updated their menu to make it more inclusive. The starters were delicious and so was the pad thai. The tofu hung lay was okay as the dish was too creamy and sweet. The flavors were not as distinct and the quantity of the rice was not that much either. The servers were friendly but the menu options could do better!",

        "text": "Some friends and I went to see a matinee at the Alliance and afterwards we decided to grab a bite to eat. I have passed the gem of a restaurant for years and finally decided to have the Nan experience and boy am I glad I did.  It isn't far from the Alliance and on a mild day it's an easy walk from the theatre.  Once we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by how upscale it looked.  I mean it's smack dab on the corner of Spring and 17th so you wouldn't think it to be fancy schmancy but it really is...elegantly decorated and very high class.  \n\nThe servers are super friendly and  the food is to die for.  I ordered the Siam Ruby and was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not a big scallop eater...I just don't like the texture.  They have a mushy feel to them.  I would prefer if they were cooked a little longer but that's not a Nan issue that's more of the preference.  I did, however, enjoy this dish.  The ingredients were perfectly blended with the spice of the curry and the sweet of the pineapple fried rice, it makes for a dynamic dish. \n\nAs for drinks, I do believe Nan has an excellent variety of wines and craft cocktails.  I ordered the Nan Spice and boy was it refreshing.  An excellent Summer cocktail.  It's light and crisp and the Chili infused syrup adds an extra kick of spice that I like.",

        "text": "Decided to come here to celebrate my birthday. They have top notch service and a beautiful upscale atmosphere. First, we ordered the Pla Muk Thod aka crispy calamari with roasted chili sauce. It was lightly battered and delicious as I hate when places over batter the meat. \n\nFor entrée, I ordered the Lamb Hung Lay which was the slow-braised lamb shank simmered in northern Thai red curry with coconut curry rice and cucumber salad. It was a beautiful dish and cooked to perfection where the meat was falling off the bones. However, all the meat dishes here were all sweet and I really don't like sweet meat especially as an entrée. I asked for recommendations on non-sweet meat dishes and this was the least sweet dish, which was still very sweet to me. I would recommend this place if you're okay with that. Therefore, giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 stars.",

First off, it's not authentic Thai, it's westernized thai with all the bs bland currys. Oh look honey, they have panang curry, how authentic......smh. The service was atrocious for the price you pay. Went with a party of 5. We ordered drinks and apps before main entre's. Our drinks took, 30min........THIRTY MINUTES  to arrive at our table. We chased down 3 separate severs and asked them all to get our drinks, no accountability or apology was given. Food finally came out an hour after drinks. Meanwhile all of our glasses from our beverages had been empty the entire while with no offer or service for more. With the addition of mediocre flavors I could not for the life of me recommend this to anyone.",
