                "text": "I booked this spot for my child's 1st birthday lunch. It has been on my list of places to try for some time. Given the type of food, I thought it was perfect for the occasion. We had a party of 16 people. As soon as we walked in, we saw several tables put together to accommodate our reservation. \nWe were greeted and promptly seated and got drinks and appetizers convo started. Our waiter, Michael, was extraordinary. He handled our large party by himself with ease, like a professional. He recommended several dishes to us, and all of them were satisfactory. The price point was excellent, leading us to try almost everything the menu offered. We had:\nGarlic bites\nItalian bacon sampler (they serve brunch on the weekends)\nThe house and Caesar salads +shrimp\nCalzones & pizza (they can interchanged into one or another): Ultimate calzone & Fontina mushroom pizza. We had each of these made to both calzone & pizza.\nPasta: Farfalle, Penna Alla Vodka w/ chicken \nItalian donuts w/ raspberry sauce\nCocktails\nEverything we ate was fantastic. We had lots of leftovers because the portions were hefty. But that is no complaint of mine. I certainly was left wanting more later. Any pictures you may have seen online (that look amazing) are not misleading you. We didn't focus on taking pics of the food because of the occasion. But it was a lovely experience for a first-time visit and a 1st birthday. We surely will be back many more times. \nThe restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating, bar seats, and high-top tables. The space isn't huge, but it wasn't packed out, so it felt comfortable for us. I enjoyed the warm tone lighting that brightened the place despite our visit on a wet and cold day in January.",

I need lessons was the single line that popped in my head when I watched the chef stretch the dough to make the pie. Where I grew up in San Francisco, pizzerias in my neighborhood would stretch and soon that dough to perfection. I too want to learn that phenomenal experience. This restaurant is top notch with a menu to match. The owner takes his quality ingredients along with a side of heart and soul to please your palate. Don't take this step lightly, it's trend setting and more pizzerias should embrace this concept. Better ingredients \nhealthier food is what life evolves around. Why waste time investing in anything less from a business perspective and from a patrons expectations? At Varasanos pizzeria, customers will get higher quality and some of the best tasting pizza in the entire state of Georgia. In my opinion. You'll have to find out for yourself. Come solo or bring a group, you will not face disappointment",

I love this style of pizza but I've def had better in the area.*cough  (Varuni Napoli) cough* They need to add a bit more sauce basil and mozzarella to their margherita pizza.. felt like I was just eating crust .. literally had barely any cheese on it at all. The pizza dough here is really good tho!\n\ngarlic bites are good but you barely get any for 7 bucks. They also forgot the sun dried tomato oil I added to my order. Lastly, we got a side order of sourdough bread thinking it would be a nice loaf of doughy table bread thats fresh & moist .. but it was literally sliced sandwich bread. Kinda weird! \n\nMaybe the pasta is good? Idk haven't tried it and probably won't now.",

The pizza has decent flavor, but is so thin and soggy that the toppings slide right off when you try to pick it up. I was shocked by how bland Nana's Sunday Gravy was (this was the worst thing we had). The garlic bites looked like ripped up scraps. The house salad was ok, but some of the toppings didn't look very fresh. I would say it's definitely overpriced for what you get and there's much better pizza places in Atlanta.",

                "text": "If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. The few times I have been here, has been for brunch and they were to celebrate a birthday. The first time I went, it was for my birthday, the 2nd time I went was for my girlfriend's birthday, and the 3rd time I went was for my friend's birthday. They have a brunch menu that goes until 11:30am-4pm on Saturdays and Sundays. One of the coolest things about this place, is that not only does it do bottomless mimosas, but it does bottomless bloody marys and bellinis as well. You can mix it up too, it doesn't have to be just one type for the entire time you are there. I personally get the bloody marys, because I love a good bloody! While they do have a brunch food menu, you are also more than welcome to order anything from the other menu as well. It is a pizzeria type of place, so I highly recommend trying one of their pizzas. \n\nThe grilled egg sandwich is excellent. Comes with some arugula and the bread has such a nice crispy bite to it. The eggs in heaven or hell (sweet or spicy) are EGG-cellent as well. I got mine spicy, because I love anything spicy. I have also tried the bacon sampler and the potatoes as well, and they are super good.\n\nApart from the food being a 10/10, the service is a 10/10 as well. All 3 times I went, the owner, Jeff, has come to our table to talk to us and ask us how our experience is going. He even took a shot with us one time! He's one of the few owners in Atlanta that I actually remember their name, and who has made a lasting impression on me and my friends. He's super friendly and quite humorous too. Definitely request to speak with him, because he's a super cool guy and he actually creates a relationship with his guests. For my girlfriend's birthday, he brought out a bubble making device and some sparklers (He did this for my birthday and my friend's as well.) Such a nice touch!\n\nThis place is the perfect brunch spot for a big group of friends or even just a place to have lunch/dinner with your significant other. They have a vast menu and a full bar, so you'll definitely find something you like. I can't recommend this place enough!!!",

We tried a peppadew and the classic Nanna's. The peppadew was good but way too soggy when it came out. The Nanna's was nothing special. Cheese, sauce, basil but tasted like a standard margherita pizza. Was expecting some more flavor and would have liked the margherita to have more cheese. Compared to other places we've been it's average. The salad was good though and the service was quick",

                "text": "It was our anniversary; every year, we go to some specialty fine dining to make our celebratory experience grand. However, this year, we decided to play cheap, yet fun! we started looking up places in Atlanta, which have great food, easy going happy vibe and fun place to celebrate; additionally, we were craving good pizzas. So we found Varsano's in Buckhead which has 4.9 stars on Google with almost 2k reviews, so we thought it must be good.\n        The place has a casual vibe with really fun staff who are attentive to your needs, even though they do it effortlessly. We wanted to order the quartro pizza (4 flavors in one) so the server suggested that we consult with the chef, and I couldn't believe that the chef himself would come up with his choices and suggestions for not only creating the pizza himself for us, but also personally take us through the journey of the flavors, their characteristics, and give us a holistic experience of his vision about a perfect pizza. We did not expect this hospitality and personalization, but his gesture and care really made our anniversary special, such that we made a meaningful human connection, got to know about his journey and life experiences. It was wonderful!\n        Now about the food. Varsano's sells the original sourdough thin crust cooked for 2.5 minutes, which is crispy and folds like a flat bread. If you are into intense flavors for a pizza like too salty pepperoni, too soury tomato sauce etc., then this place is not for you. The chef specializes in pizza artistry based on subtle flavors that make the ingredients like cheese and herbs, shine. For example, you could only be tasting the buffalo mozzarella and basil in your margheritta with a compliment of fresh tomatoes, where the flowery aroma of the cheese would come through indicating its origin; or some speciality cheese with just arugula with a hint of lemon to caress your taste buds, however, the taste may not adhere to the description of a traditional pizza. The tiramisu was very authentic. No wonder, we did enjoy the pizza very much. would be safe to say as best in the Atlanta area. However, I did mention even to the chef, that the best pizzas I have had in my life, were at Ronaldo's in Mexico and a small Islamic shop on New York street :), no offense at all!",

I went here with my friend who has nonstop been telling me all about this place and their bottomless mimosas for the entirity of this year so i was sooo excited to finally come with her and try it out! The Brunch on Saturdays starts at 11:30 and they have a selection of eclectic options but our reason for coming was for the breakfast pizza! We sat on their beautiful patio and my friends dog was given a water bowl which was super lovely! \n\nWe got the Scrambler egg pizza and asked if we could substitute a sunny side up egg on it ( THATS THE MOVE!! thank you for letting us do that) it was sooo freaking good i absolutely devoured it! We also after did the brunch dolce pizza which the toppings were incredible it was a sweet dessertish pizza but tasted so good and was so well done ah! \n\nOne thing we were kind of bummed about is they stopped doing their bottomless mimosas and only do glasses or pitchers ( pitcher was kind of pricey and though we did feel a lil  tipsy im just not sure i would do a pitcher again for the cost aspect! bc it was about two mimosas each ish) \n\n But everything else was 10/10 also our server Natasha  was so so lovely!! oh and they had such great playlist!",

Only the kitchen staff struggled to keep it open. We offered to take the food to go, but they said they couldn't even accommodate that at the moment. The manager - Jeffrey - was nowhere to be found and was not even accessible. And the kitchen staff made it clear that Jeffrey was the one at fault.\n\nWhat a joke of a restaurant. Not sure how long they can survive with such abominable leadership.",

The person who was going to sit us grabbed the menus and said to follow him, but then another person came and snatched the menu off his hand which was very rude. It was not busy so when the waiter came he took our order quickly. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio and when the waiter brought the bottle it was the wrong one. My boyfriend and I noticed after the waiter started to pour it since it was red. We looked at each other, but neither of us wanted to make a big deal so we didn't complain. Then our salad and pizza came out which was very good. The restaurant started to get busy, so we ordered our dessert and asked for the bill at the same time. We waited about 30 minutes and looked for our waiter, but didn't see him. We had to ask another waiter for our bill and then our waiter came apologizing because he never put in our dessert! He said the dessert would be on the house if we waited 8 more minutes, but at that point we were irritated of waiting about 45 minutes. We just wanted to pay our bill and go. We gave him the credit card, so that he can charge it quickly and it still took him about 15 minutes to run the card. Then he came back with a cellphone and walked away. He didn't say anything to us and when we looked at the cellphone it was off. We figured we needed to sign it, but the cellphone was locked. At this point we were very frustrated. It was clear that the waiter did not care and just wanted us to go. It was awful and even though the food was good, it is not worth it to put up with bad service. I will certainly never come back to this location.",

They never came! The bartender was far too overwhelmed & couldn't handle the volume. Not her fault! It's clear they're understaffed.I get it! However, after being sat, our first round of drinks came not only in pieces, but 20/30 mins apart...We had our entrees being delivered while some were still waiting for their first glass of wine!!!... They had already eaten their apps... That's almost an hour gap! It was a bad experience overall... & I'm embarrassed that I hosted a special occasion here... I'm not one to write bad reviews, but this quite honestly sucked.... No managers on staff to speak to from what I was told... & The owner goes ghost when the restaurant is crashing... The server tried calling him. Not to mention PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE!.... On a Positive note, our server was an amazing...She did her best. I spent almost $900 after tip For Papa Johns behavior.

My husband and I shared a spinach, walnut and gorgonzola salad, a pizza and the pasta and meatballs.  We loved the pizza with minimal toppings and a light, crispy, thin crust, and the pasta was wonderful with a rich tomato sauce, and tasty meatballs!  We were too full to even contemplate dessert.  The food came out very quickly and our server was really friendly.",

And even their airport location enjoys a 4+ star Google rating, you know something else is in play... Perhaps it's either a disgruntled ex-employee and/or Antico Pizzaria playing games.\n\nWhen the professional food critics at Cond\u00e9 Nast ranking this as one of the 3 best pizzerias in the United States; and their airport franchise as one of the top ten airport restaurants in the world (including airport restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong), you know this pizza joint puts out great pizzas.",

This location is a few blocks from our house so we decided to try it. I was hungry, I forgot to take pictures, Sorry :(  The food was very pretty looking. We ordered the caprese salad, and some garlic bread for appetizers. They were both delicious with big chunks of garlic in the bread. My husband had the football calzone, and it was filled with pepperoni and sausage. I had the Margarita's with anchovies and capers yummmm.  To top it all we ended it with pizza donuts with a side of the best raspberry pur\u00e9e I have ever had.",

At 3:18 I noticed that people who had ordered their food after me were getting it. I asked when mine would be done and the staff seemed clueless. At that point, another customer noted she had also ordered before me and not gotten her pizza.  She looked st me like I was lying, even though my receipt showed the time I ordered.  Sierra, at this point, said 3 minutes for my pizza. And when I asked why it was taking so long if a pizza took 3 minutes. She proceeded to tell me I never asked how long a pizza took, and that she did me a favor by taking my order cause she should be on break (she said that).  I asked to speak to the manager Alexis. She seemed to not care that myself and someone else was waiting for pizza. She also thought I was lying even when she saw my receipt with the purchase time. I asked for a refund, they told me 3 minutes. So I waited an additional 10 minutes for my \"3 minute pizza\". It was taking so long I once again asked to speak to the manager, but Alexis once again didn't seem to care about the delay. At that point another woman joined in to note how she was also waiting 20+ minutes while others were getting their orders. No one seemed to care. There was also no syatem beyond staff writing down orders on paper. \n\n\nIn the end, the pizza tasted half done because they were just rushing to get it to me and I didn't eat it. I was just disgusted at the experience, from the staff telling us they were doing me a favor (I was ordering and pay for pizza) to the manager not caring when I talked to her twice and assuming I was lying about the wait. I won't be coming back and I've told family and friends about my experience. I should have gone to chik Fila next door.",

I loved that this was one of the few brunch restaurants in Atlanta that has brunch on Saturday as well as Sunday, they didn't ask for a deposit for a slightly large party & it was very convenient to make a reservation. \n\nPROS: \n- Free parking for the restaurant as long as you park in the designated residential/restaurant lot.\n- Bottomless Mimosas with options! You can select bottomless Bloody Mary's, Bellini's or Mimosas and they do not disappoint.\n- The service was great. Our waitress was very nice and patient with our party.\n- The birthday treat. The waitress brought out pastries for me with a sparkler on top.\n\nCON: \n- Mixed reviews amongst the party on the food. I personally was not crazy about my entree. My pancakes seemed to be made cornbread style and I was not a fan. \n\nOverall I would definitely give Varasano's another visit in the near future. A few of the pizzas at the table received good reviews so I would like to give those a try.",

A few faves: meatballs, margarita pizza with chicken, breakfast sandwich on croissant, caprese salad, and any of their pastas. \n\nParking is in the building. First floor of the apartment complex. But space is a bit tight. Uber May be better. Patio is great for kids and dogs when weather is nice. \n\nTips:\nFriday is bottomless wine night! For 12.99 you can have Pinot noir, cab, Sauvignon blanc, and Pinot Grigio all night long. \nWeekend brunch is great as well $13-15 bottomless and exchangeable mimosa, bellinis, bloody Mary's, and more!",

Upon entering I was welcomed by Haley and she was so sweet. \n\nFood: I had the Nana's pizza, doughnuts and a special dessert. The pizza was very authentic and delicious. All of the ingredients were fresh and I'm sure the meatballs are being made by a little old lady in the back. The doughnuts were so flaky and sweet. They were served warm with raspberry sauce and I'm obsessed. \n\nService: Haley was the best service I've ever received especially making sure glasses were filled. She also took the time to engage with us and make sure our glasses were never empty. Also, the owner made it his business to visit each table and ask for feedback. Jeff is amazing and so is his staff. \n\nLocation: This is prime location off of peachtree and they have a gorgeous patio. They are also having a March madness event that kicks off on February 29th. Come in and ask for Kera to get a special gift.  \n\nOverall I will definitely be coming back and making sure I get Nana's Pizza or the Elvis sandwich. Everything is so detail oriented. The cost is amazing and it has nice music playing in the background. If you're looking for a place where you can alternate between drinks for one cost and have authentic Italian food check out Varasano's.",

We had a basic pepperoni pie and maybe my impression would have improved had we tried one of the specialties? The crust was on the puffier side of thin and the flavors were good. I also had a nice local craft pint.\n\nParking can be a bit of a mess - the lot under the building is tight and usually full. I certainly wouldn't make a special trip to try them - but if you're in the area, especially if within walking distance, it's a good pizza option.\n\nThe service was adequate - call it average. We had to flag the server down to checkout.",
