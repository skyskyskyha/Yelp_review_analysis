A quiet afternoon lunch or an evening dining experience, the food is quality- rich with flavor and authenticity.The charcuterie boards are an excellent grazing conversational bite, perfect for a day date or girls' night out. The Caccio e pepe entree is served al dente with a rich cheese coating, a must try. And last but not least, for dessert, if you are a lover or evening liker of espresso, the Affgato (Espresso + Gelato) will blow you away. Our server was very attentive and accommodating.",

        "text": "The first thing you notice when you review the menu of Storia Fresco- is the QR code - which loads to a manifesto of sorts - from the owner - to the guests.....it's an interesting read, some I agree with, some, well - to each their own,   But the headline here is the pasta - it's real, and it's' fabulous.....more details - \n\nStorico Fresco is a HUGELY popular spot in Buckhead,  It is a market of sorts, acting as a restaurant.  Very casual, very busy, mixed crowd - singles, couples, groups, kids, dates.....noisy - hard to hear.  Outside patio is nice, sidewalk is not nice as the sewer smell is present.\n\nWe had a variety of food - ALL of it was superb.   The meat and cheese board, fantastic - good variety, bread service - fantastic,   Octopus, deeply grilled/charred - great flavor with nice beans, herbs.....super good.  \n\nAll of us had pasta, except one who had salmon.   The pasta is house made, and it is lovely, a nice bite.  The bolognese is perfect, the mushroom cream sauce is perfect.   The sizes are perfect - who complains about portion size?  I don't quite understand that.   It's a fine size - and the pasta and sauce are rich, filling and just right\n\nThe salmon was not good - overcooked.   Asked for a mista salad on the side, got a spinach salad\n\nA number of times, the runner brought wrong food to the table.   No problem, we let them know it wasn't ours and he took it back, but the third time, he was clearly annoyed.   Also one of our table didn't get their food - and no - it didn't take longer - as the manifesto warns ahead of time, it was just forgotten.  \n\nOverall, a pleasant experience.  Good lively atmosphere, good food, decent service- no not great service, but I don' think that is possible.  They pack the place, they don't have enough servers or kitchen staff.   I don't pretend that is still not a problem - it is.  But asking guests to have infinite patience isn't right either - I guess we vote with our feet and head somewhere else - OR - maybe the owner says - hmmm.  Maybe don't seat so many people that service suffers - OR - maybe seat people, give them some bread and a low cost glass of wine and say - glad you are here.   We will get to you as soon as we can service you well.    A statement doesn't excuse errors....it DOES give people context and that is a good thing, but it is not a cure-all....yes they make mistakes, as we all do. But they also make fabulous pasta.  \n\nGo eyes wide open, be prepared for a really good meal, roll with the glitches, if something doesn't look right, then say something....and mangia!  Enjoy",

        "text": "We stopped by here awhile back at the recommendation of a friend who likes Italian. I made reservations for a weekday lunch. It was a little difficult for me to figure out where the location was because of apple maps once we walked down the street it was off to the side. \n\nWe were quickly seated inside. The inside is trendy and loud. I can see where having a conversation can be hard. We had to pretty much yell to have a conversation. We ordered the Polpette, Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, and Chitarra Arrabbiata. The food was ok. The pasta was chewy which is good, but I think everything was too acidic for my liking. My husband also thought the food was ok too. Would I come back? Possibly, but not really worth a solo trip to the area.",

        "text": "Came here for a celebratory lunch for my one year-old niece. SERVICE and Food were excellent. Sat outside on the patio underneath the walkway closest to the athletic store. Dined on a starter of fried branzino and calamari - very light and fresh seafood and the breading was light and delicate. Also have the fried artichoke hearts those were delicious as well and very light and fresh. Main dish was the Cacio e Pepe with a side of salmon *chef's kiss*. Do you have to be a big fan of black pepper to really like the Cacio a Pepe so keep that in mind. We also had some sparkling rose to wet our whistle along with sparkling water and Atlanta's finest. Perfect lunch, very refreshing and filling and walked away feeling very satiated.",

        "text": "Unfortunately this will now be a to go only spot for me. We finally made it in for a dining experience and were left sorely disappointed. We started with the suppli siciliano risotto balls. In theory, they should have been amazing with mozzarella cheese and ragu inside but the filling was cold and the mozzarella wasn't melted. I also think it should most definitely be made known that you only get two balls for $14!!! The Instagram picture advertises more and it's not even like they are large portions.... I mean we are talking slightly larger than a golfball. I honestly feel robbed after this one and am still disappointed in myself for not saying something to the server. \n\nWe then got the bolognese and cacio e pepe for our entrees. No one offered us cheese or pepper and we had to ask for the bread we had ordered at the beginning of the meal. The cacio e pepe was the real let down.. the flavor was there but the pasta simply wasn't cooked. We are all about an al dente pasta but this was not that and tough to chew. Beyond the food, club music was playing the whole meal making for a weird vibe. \n\nHonestly we walked away from this whole experience saying that there are much better Italian options in Atlanta, including their sister restaurant Forza Storico.",

We let you down. So sorry you had the worse experience of your life. Many others loved tonight because they are mindful of how incredibly hard it is for our industry to even stay afloat. \nWe will keep your review in mind and try to do better but understand these are not normal times when half of the available population prefers to stay home and gather unemployment while we strive to do what we can. \nBe mindful. Everyone lost a LOT in the last 4 months. Glad to see you didn’t. \nElite reviewers make the day. We bow out with a very simple sorry. And a very simple go wherever you want because we suck. We’re horrible. Everyone hates Storico. Let everyone know we are the worse Italian restaurant in Atlanta. Thank you Sarah. Good luck to you too",

The artichoke was supposed to be delicious but there wasn't much sustenance to it. The bread was good but light on olive oil. The atmosphere was lively but the music was uncomfortably loud for a date night. The entrees saved the day. I had the fried pork chop. It was juicy and had a savory citrus finish with the arugula on top. My wife ordered the cappelletti spinaci which had a very tasty center and has protein from the spinach. I'm particular about having protein in my meals. Many of the pastas came with no protein, so the spinaci is a good delicious and nutritious choice.",

Highly recommend! Total of 4.\nCacio e pepe - yum!! hit the spot!\nRavioli spinaci - looked very yummy, good portion size too\n\nDrinks:\nPinot Noir - not too shabby\n\nService:\nIt was a bit cold and windy so we asked if they can turn the heater on next to us which he did. The waiter was friendly and I accidentally left my jacket ther but went back when I realized and they were holding it for me.\n\nThe only minor thing that was a bit eh was that the outside tables were on the steep hill so it was a bit hard to sit the entire time.

It is slightly enclosed and heaters make it quite toasty. I didn't sit outside but it did feel very warm even though it was quite frigid outside. Inside is very loud, so just be aware if you are expecting a quieter environment. The food is divine though. All pasta dishes are amazing! Definitely try there list of custom craft cocktails as well.

Outside, the super tiny wooden tables for 2 and the chairs are literally ready to flip any moment also because on a downhill sidewalk. Now, not trying to be too picky but that's not exactly the type of comfort I am looking for when dining out. \nIt's a restaurant, where you spend easy $60/80 per person, they really need to work on the furniture, set up, and service.",

Somehow however I was able to snag a table online for Storico Fresco. \n\nI was so glad I did as when we showed up this place was absolutely SLAMMED.  Honestly i was in shock that they had our table waiting for us with no wait considering how busy it was here.\n\nThis is a very lively place, it's basically an italian market where you can also dine.  It's not very big but it is extremely popular and pretty loud inside.  We were actually having trouble hearing our waiter as it was so loud.\n\nThe pasta here is made in house and everything we got was absolutely delicious.  I had the Cavatelli with wild boar ragu and I enjoyed it very much.  \n\nThis ended up being a great place to bring a big party since it had a great ambiance and we had a very nice dinner.

The seasoning on top was one of the best I've had.\n\nAlong with the dinner and appetizer came a side salad which was nicely portioned and the dressing was very good.\n\nNote to ownership; when someone orders via GrubHub and especially from a hotel it might be a wise idea to spend the extra $0.11 and include a fork and a napkin.",

We had a reservation for 2 and got sat at the smallest patio table I've ever seen at a restaurant, right against the door of the neighboring gym. After ordering a side of cocktails and bread service, it took over 40 minutes for our server to ask for our main entree order. After ordering, the server did not stop by until we had already completed the dinner and were ready for the check (which I would expect more of considering we were spending over $100 for a meal). The food was mids for the price and the service was very disappointing.",

        "text": "Changes absolutely not for the better. I hesitated to write this review as I've been to this restaurant at least half dozen times in the past and had always loved it.  While I understand that many restaurants have had to make some adjustments after surviving Covid, the adjustments that Storico has made as a total package no longer work: way too many tables now, the portion sizes have been so scaled down, and reservations appear to be meaningless. I never mind paying for a good dining experience, but don't expect to pay close to $500 and leave hungry.\n\n1)  We had an 8:00 reservation and didn't get seated till 8:40...reservation appeared to be meaningless.\n2)  The prepared food fridges have been replaced with way too many tables, many large communal tables, and no accounting for acoustics...the noise level is now deafening to the point of not being able to hold a comfortable conversation...even our order had to be repeated a few times for our server to get it right.\n3) Biggest bone of contention is that the portion sizes have been so scaled down, even after appetizers, and entrees, our party of six had to order two more entrees... I'm sorry, but when you pay $26 for a basic pasta dish it should be a satisfying portion.  Added to this, we couldn't taste any difference between the sauces of Cavatelli with wild boar ragu' vs the Tagliatelli Bolognese...and both dishes were bland.\n\nThere is no bread service, unless you pay for it. I'm sorry, this is a pasta restaurant. Bread should be automatic, otherwise your entree actually costs $4 more. \n\nSad that we will be hard pressed to return again.",

I also ordered a side of the mushrooms. The food came out pretty quickly! The cacio e pepe was absolutely perfect. Not too peppery (which is my fear with ordering this dish sometimes) and just enough cheesy. It wasn't a huge portion size if I'm being honest, but none the less tasty as heck. The mushrooms were also so delicious! I actually do suggest ordering them because they were that good! So flavorful and it comes with a ton of them! I brought half home. They do have a weekly pasta special. I've seen a few of them that look super tasty on their Instagram. Overall a good meal. A good spot for a date night or just a casual dinner with a friend!",

I had been dreaming of the burnt ricotta pie.....sweet dough, lightly sweetened ricotta, raspberry jam, honey and dusted with powdered sugar...\n\nCharley got the Robiola cheesecake, creamy with a buckwheat lemon crust\n\nJ got the Tiramisu ...espresso soaked Savoiardi cookies, marsala, marscapone and dusted cocoa...\n\nI, normally a chatterbox am left speechless....\n\nWhat an amazing dining experience.....",

The wild boar pasta was excellent!  The fried chicken was very flavorful.  Others at our table had the bronzini and the lasagna, they both said it was excellent.  I'd definitely go there again!\n\nTheir bathroom sign is pretty funny!",

I've become a fan of sitting at the bar because the bartenders and their service is nothing less than top tier. My last visit I had the fried chicken and OH EM GEE it was DIVINE. I've never had a more perfectly fried piece of chicken. I go here frequently for the Pepe though it's literally the best I've had.

I can't make this level of poor customer service up. It is honestly laughable. \n\nI've eaten here before and the food was just ok. This is not my first time having a negative customer experience here and this is enough to make me never go back.

It's hard to find parking here, so the valet parking may be the best option for you, especially if it is raining like it was for us.\n\nOnce inside, we seated and ordered some drinks and appetizers. We both ordered margaritas (though the light weight did look interesting) and a few appetizers, both of which were great. I wish they had brought four meatballs instead of three, as that's much easier for two people to split. The stuffed squash blossoms - real good, and they would be wise to make a dinner sized portion of this for people! My wife ha the tagliatelle alla bolognese, which was very tasty. I chose the Linguine al Pesto e Gamberi - pesto shrimp pasta. The shrimp were full sized. Not de-veigned or peeled, which was a bummer. It ruined what would have otherwise been a great meal. As it was, it was still a great meal, though I would probably choose something else the next time I eat here. The squid-ink pasta has caught me eye...",

        "text": "What can I say about Storico that hasn't been said on this forum and everywhere else? It's simply MAGICAL.\nMy wife first visited this restaurant during the pandemic before we were married and while things were locked down in LA and we haven't stopped coming ever since.\nRomulo greeted us with open arms as it was the first time we had dined INSIDE since the world closed down and we celebrated! We instantly hit it off and his knowledge coupled with warm and caring personally have made us MASSIVE fans. We travel to Atlanta roughly 4 times a year and have yet to go to the city WITHOUT stopping into Storico. There's something truly special about the food and culture there that you simply don't see in many places and for us it started with Romulo from Rio!\nThere's no bad seats in the house, from the chef's table to the bar, and everything in between your surrounded by authentic Italian cuisine and the freshest ingredients. Thanks again to our shepherd Romulo and the team, you guys truly have something special!",

        "text": "Solid enough Italian food in a hyper trendy spot in buckhead. Has a euro feel and the buzz is alive and well as you sit outside. Staff is bustling. The cocktails are great and can't go wrong with many of the apps. The suppli and pizzette were good. My steak was surprisingly good with oyster mushrooms and arugula for $26. The ravioli are homemade and so is much of the pasta so you're in for a treat. Sorry no pics.",

        "text": "My favorite restaurant in Atlanta!! Anytime we have friends or family in town, we take them to this restaurant and they love it just as much as we do. Its our go to date night spot as well. The ambience is great. They incorporate team based serving approaches. Their spinach and butter sage dish is my favorite, as well as their tiramisu! It's the go-to every time. They also have great bread service (bread does not come with pasta, it's a separate order). The menu is a little pricey but 100% worth the splurge. You won't be disappointed. I also recommend making a reservation, they usually always have an availability but you'll typically still end up waiting a few minutes for a table.",
