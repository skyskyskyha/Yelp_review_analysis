We tried the Krispy Kreme donut burger with sweet potato waffle fries.  The donut had been grilled so the sugar had caramelized.  The burger was delicious.  We tried the Bold Rock Hard Cider and it was a light flavor added to the meal. This is a great place to come with friends. Good service. Nice bathrooms. Handicapped accessible.",

        "text": "I ordered the standard Cypress Burger. The meat itself was good. While the outside of the burger was closer to being \"well done,\" the inside was more medium. Neither were the medium-well that I requested, but it was certainly edible. I added American cheese (for a buck, which I think is a little ridiculous). The sweet and tangy pickles added a nice pop of flavor to the sandwich, but it could have benefited from some grilled onions or special sauce (the former of which would have added another dollar). The bun was light and fluffy, which offset the slightly overdone patty. Overall, the burger was good but not necessarily memorable.\n\nThe sweet potato waffle fries were delicious. Crispy on the outside, soft and slightly mushy on the inside--just how I like them.\n\nI wouldn't describe the service as hospitable, but our orders were correct and our drinks were refilled regularly. I can't ask for much more than that.\n\nThe tucked-away nature of the restaurant and the inside pub-like atmosphere inside were both nice. The shaded patio out front would make for a great happy-hour spot on a nice day.",

        "text": "This is one of my favorite neighborhood bars in Atlanta. It has the perfect vibe for an evening drink, a satisfying meal or to chill with your friends in a big group. Seldom do you find places that offer all of the above.\nTo top it off it's not expensive at all and the service is pretty decent (especially given how crowded it can get).\n\nIt has an outdoor patio area (during winter, they light up an outdoor fireplace for you to stay warm and people get together and drink in a circle around it - it's super chill)\nTheir indoor seating is comprised of booths mostly with an additional room for big parties. The booths offer a more intimate setting with dim lighting where as the big  group dining area is better lit and the music volume is slightly lower.\n\nBest part (yes, another best part).. their menu is small but has a variety of cuisines and usually this is a red flag.. but they somehow make it work. All the way from apps to main course.\n\nAll in all a great place to hang out when you want to \"go out\", have a quality meal at a buzzing neighborhood bar without burning a hole in your pocket.",

Cypress Street came up, we took a walk to check it out. This is a happening place at 11:30 at night on a Thursday.\n\nAs we approached you could tell immediately this was a popular hangout bar in the area. The sound of music and people talking really loudly permeated out into the streets. The sound was augmented by their outdoor seating area.\n\nWe could not get a real feel for the inside as it was so dark but we saw to the right just inside they had a seating area and tables. We had a seat and were greeted right away by someone with menus. My wife ordered the fish and chips and we each ordered a drink. The drinks were served quickly and the Fish and Chips shortly thereafter.  I had already eaten earlier and did not order anything to eat.\n\nMy wife says the fish and chips hit the spot but it was not knock your socks off.\n\nOverall this was a good experience and served our purpose. Cool interior too!",

They do have a patio outside which can hold large parties. \n\nI started off with a mimosa ($3). I was taken back by the price but the taste also reflected the price. Either the orange juice or the sparkling wine tasted off. \n\nI initially ordered the Nashville chicken and waffle but was told it was not available. So I decided on the chicken biscuit with fries ($11). For the presentation and what you get, the value is not there. A chicken biscuit from chick-fil-a has a better value and taste. The fries were cold as if they were sitting out for a while. \n\nI was not the only with a problem. My friends frittata was supposed to come out with collard greens but came out with cole slaw instead. \n\nI'm not sure I would give it another chance and don't recommend it for brunch.",

Super casual restaurant, no hostess to seat you rather it's seat yourself, there's a full bar, and outdoor dining options in the cold months due to the overhead heaters. The food was basic and the server was rude! I had the pretzel and brownie. Every time I asked her for something she seemed bothered except when I needed change to leave a tip. I would not recommend this place. I will not be back.",

Their food is awesome, it's not bar food at all. Plus they have great drinks and lots of beers on tap. It's become a great brunch spot too. During the day this is a great place for a date but at night it's a great bar hangout with good food. \n\nI tried: \nStrawberry spinach arugula - this salad was great. Very simple and it hit the spot. \nPeanut Jake salad- this is like a thai salad. It's heartier, it was my date's main entree. He thoroughly enjoyed it.   \n\nRoasted chicken Marsala - this was my main entree. It was delicious! Much better than I expected it to be. Though to be honest, I ordered it when I saw a table next to me order the entree.  It consisted of thing but long noodles, with the perfect Marsala wine sauce and chicken. \n\nDrinks: \nOaxacan dead- this drink wasn't my favorite but it was strong. \n\nMezcal , cucumber, lime- this drink was very sweet but very  good. I would try this one again. \n\nFarmers smash - this one contained gin, mint, and green tea. I loved it, and it was  very smooth",

I was coming from the Mercedes stadium so it was super close. \n\nI got there around 1AM and was told I could sit anywhere. There's inside and outside seating and I chose to go indoors which was just as dark as outside. Do we not believe in dim lighting? Candles? Something? \n\nIt took about ten minutes for a server to come by and bring water. That's all the time I needed to select what I wanted from the very limited late night menu. \n\nI ordered the sweet potato nachos. The sweet potato makes it healthy, ok? It was delicious and a great sized portion. If I were to go back I would try the pizza egg rolls. My brother in law had that and he loved it. \n\nMy negatives are the bathrooms being dingy, slow service and little to no lighting.",

Cypress Street used to be a back alley to access parking garages along Peachtree and West Peachtree Streets.  These days, with the full-on gentrification of this part of Midtown, and the construction of dozens of high rise and mid-rise condos, Cypress is now a pedestrian friendly tree-lined oasis with cafes, etc.   There is outdoor seating that feels like a neighborhood beer garden, and indoor seating with a very friendly bartender.\n\nFood here is terrific pub grub.  Chicken fingers had some sort of special spice that gave them a little kick and set them far apart from the usual.  Fried green tomatoes were exactly right: crispy outside, almost gooey soft inside.\n\nService was slightly hit or miss.  A grumpy \"seat yourself\" at the door was a little mystifying (and carried a different message than a \"oh sit anywhere you like\" would have).  Service at the table was a little chaotic.  When our server periodically disappeared, we kept gong to the very friendly bartender to get additional things added to our bill, get the check, etc.",

Man I bit into a crispy crispy burnt fry no seasoning and looked at the fry and said oh no so I reach to a stop light and open up the to go box looked at the fries man I was like why would you guys let this be ok they are overcook how do you mess up frys. Then I said I'm pulling over to try the burger at this point I went to grab it the whole bottom slid right off the whole burger too soggy I guess.

        "text": "The best way I can sum up our visit to Cypress Street was \"underwhelming and unimpressed\". \n\nIf you're looking for a spot with a great bar menu, great location, and a nice patio....I can see where this place has its perks. They have lots of outdoor seating (and are dog friendly) and in general, have a really appealing outdoor space. The service was a little slow when we went (people love their weekend brunch!), but to be fair the place was really busy and had LOTS of large parties. Our server was super friendly, so we didn't mind the slower service too much. \n\nWhat really kills me is how lack luster the food is. Maybe we didn't try the right items, I don't know....but I was so underwhelmed with everything we tried. The best thing we got was the Fried Green Tomato appetizer, the aioli sauce with the goat cheese was such a nice pairing with the tomatoes. For entrees, I got the vegetable frittata and y'all....I would HARDLY call this a frittata. It truly was just scrambled eggs on the bottom and sautéed peppers, onions, and spinach thrown on top. It was more of a scramble than a frittata. In general, it was just....meh. My husband got the gyro and again, it was another mediocre dish. He described it as a \"feta bomb\" , which I disagree but to be fair, I would eat a block of cheese without blinking BUT I DIGRESS. And the slaw had so much potential....but it had absolutely no spice or seasoning to it. It just tasted like slaw tossed in mayo. Overall, we were just underwhelmed with the dishes we chose. \n\nI feel like I would give this place another shot, possibly for dinner, as I feel like the outdoor patio views late at night would be killer. I just don't necessarily recommend this as a top brunch spot in Atlanta.",

Burger to be honest was pretty gross, burgers are my favorite food and for bar food this place just isn't it. I'm sure it was good at one time but the quality just doesn't seem to be there. The waiters and waitresses were awesome though! Oh and a sour beer was $7 and a Miller light was $5 I'm not sure where they get off charging that. \n\nShort answer I wouldn't go back here for bar food, if you want an atmosphere to watch some games outside then that's cool.",

Like the artery clogging donut bun, cheddar dripping, caramelized onions, beefy bacon burger was to die for. It was so good. I mean I greedily ate it on 75 on my way home lol!\n\nIt looked like your typical hole in the wall college burger joint. But man! It was perfect. Definitely hit the spot. \n\nThe menus were weird - on clipboards. I'm not Sure how the parking was because I walked over but it didn't appear to be any...\n\nThe menu was also confusing as I thought you could only order the items on that day listed but I saw a previous review on this burger and fries so I got it. I paid exactly $15.16 with tax so just be prepared to pay around that Amount. \n\nBurger took about 10 mins to make and well worth the wait. I'm not typically this greedy about a review lol but this was a good one. Glad I chose this place over Vortex",
