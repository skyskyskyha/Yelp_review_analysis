However being int Atlanta I don't have high expectations for calamari.\n\nEverything else absolutely delicious. And the service was great. Ask for Portia...she's popular and people love her. She moves quick so be ready. The place is crowded and loud but a great atmosphere in a  good location. The tapas are good, if possible I recommend getting a larger table if not and you ordered tapas the table will fill crowded. That's my tip. Enjoy.",

The menu was quite overwhelming at first, but there were several options for everyone's interests. We LOVED the Brisket Montaditos, I've never had tomato marmalade over savory meat and it was delicioussssss. The chicken stew from their seasonal menu was also scrumdiddlyumptious :p The grilled octopus was also great and creative with the corn puree pairing. I do have a few complaints, the patatas bravas were a bit dry and would've been better if saucier, they brought out three plates at once, we didn't have enough bread with the stew, and sat us right next to the door so it was a bit cold. All in all, I recommend this place and would come back!",

We had 12 people in total and that was our bill and boy did we eat. The Brisket Montaditos was by far my favorite! This place was easy to accommodate anyone with food allergies. Food was delicious and service was excellent. I wish I had pictures to share but we dug into the food that quickly. Also enjoyed the croquettes, meatballs, patatas bravas, and brussel sprouts!

        "text": "My cousins and I came here with our SO's for a Christmas brunch and it was so so good. First of all, I made a reservation over the phone, and there was a bit of miscommunication, and the wrong date was set so when we arrived on the 23rd, there was no reservation for us, and we had a big group of almost 12 people! But the host was very kind to us, and he opened up a private room for us on the second floor and it definitely surpassed our expectations. Our waitress, her name is Christina, and she took premium care of us. We all ended up ordering from the pri fixe menu. One thing I will say about this menu is that I was taken aback by the portion sizes. These are full portion sizes in every single course. It's a three course menu that is I believe about $40 per person and you get a appetizer, I mean dish, and a brunch dessert so we ended up getting a variety of things like avocado, toast, flatbreads, and things like that, and our main dishes were burgers, steaks, sautéed chicken, standard breakfast, like eggs and hashbrowns, etc. And then the dessert included things such as a Nutella and chocolate waffle, there was a brioche, French toast, a blueberry and ricotta pancakes, these are decadent for portions, so if I had known that they were going to be this big I probably would've shared it, but I don't regret it at all! We also all got the bottom is mimosas, which of $30 and includes sangria and your choice of pineapple or passion fruit mimosa. A 10 out of 10 experience. The playlist was fire, we were able to make as much noise as we wanted, well as much noise as to be expected, when you were getting together with family, after not seeing each other for 10 years, lol! And I can't think Christina and bulla Gastrobar enough!",

It was very quiet and we were able to get a table immediately.\n\nOur server Paige was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the Lemongrass Collins, Bougie Palmer, and the Sangria Blanca. I wasn't a fan of the Sangria Blanca but both the lemongrass collins and bougie palmer were amazing. They were refreshing and perfect if you have a sweet tooth. We also ordered the Chef's board and churros con chocolate. They were perfect accompaniments to our drinks.\n\nWe didn't get any tapas, but would love to visit again to try!",

They still had the Barbie cocktails available and were very good and refreshing. We Started off with a couple plates: ham croquettes and the chorizo cheese dip. The croquettes were soo good and perfect little bites. Our server warned us the chorizo cheese dip was not like queso like one would think but red sauce based, we gave it a try anyway. It's was to my surprise much better than expected. Then we split a margherita flatbread that was perfect to split with someone, and flavorful as well. Bathrooms are on the second floor reachable by stairs or elevator. Very good experience, would like to come back for some paella!",

My personal favorite was the brisket bites (forgot the name) and the tuna tartare. The shrimp paella was also really yummy! The plates come out pretty quickly and you can order in different rounds. As a good to know, you can only order with your specific server, even if other servers help bring out your food. The chef personally came to greet our larger group which really made the experience that much cooler!",

The shrimp was beyond savory and juicy with a hint of heat, and words cant described how good the flatbread was. Definitely be sure to try both. Although the bar area was a little congested and loud, I can't wait to return again to try other menu items.",

        "text": "I haven't been to bulla in a while, but I got a notification that they now have a bottomless brunch, so I just had to try it. The restaurant decor is the same as it was before  nicely decorated. But, the dining area inside is a little cramped just for the simple fact the person behind me kept bumping into me and the people next to us were basically sitting at out our table. I know it's summer, but the restaurant was also really warm I had to use the portable fan I had in my purse, we were sweating a lil but.\n\nIt took a while for us to get a waitress probably because they were understaffed like most places, which I get. So the hostess ended up coming to us and apologizing that no one had came over and she took our drink order. Then about another 10 minutes later the waitress showed up. \n\nWe decided to do the brunch pre fixe menu because it sounded delicious.. I wanted to start off with the sopa de garbanzo frito but when I said, no poached egg, the waitress told me the soup is premade and the egg is already in there and cannot be taken out so I opted for the smoked salmon montaditos instead (which I didn't really want) but, they surprised me and were actually very tasty. For my entree I got the braised pork hash with breakfast potatoes, and no poached egg. I have to say even with the addition of salt, pepper, and Sriracha (which was a strange to me that they had that but no actual hot sauce) it was still the most bland dish I've ever tasted. It tasted like everything was just boiled in water and I found it weird that the potatoes weren't even seasoned because the potatoes that came with my dining companions dish were seasoned to perfection. The waitress noticed I didn't like the dish i and offered me another option. I asked for the Albondigas instead but she said they weren't on the brunch menu. I then showed her where they were located on the menu, but she insisted they weren't available no problem I got the brisket montaditos. They were much more flavorful and tasty. For my third course I got the ricotta pancakes and once again, they just were too bland to me three cold bland pancakes with blueberry compote on top. That \"lemon gel\" couldn't save them (not like it tasted like anything either) I couldn't eat it. For me the three stars is pretty much just for the drink options. In the fact that you can switch between a mimosa and sangrias during brunch.\n\nOn another note, my dining companion said the watermelon salad was okay but it was mainly tomatoes. Her first course came after her burger which she thought was strange considering it was already probably pre-made. That the burger was also a little bland but once she added ketchup it was better. Lastly her hazelnut waffles were really good. Guess I just ordered all the wrong things.",

For a group of 3, we ordered the brunch paella, patatas bravas, and grilled steak and were very satisfied and full. \n\nBrunch paella - big portions (its supposed to serve 3-4 I believe), very savory and delicious! The flavors with egg, bacon, and tomato really make the dish satisfying \n\nPatatas bravas - a must order at every tapas place I go to. Here, the potatoes are very crispy and fluffy on the inside, with a yummy slightly spicy sauce\n\nGrilled steak - tender steak complemented really nicely with a vinegary salsa and a delicious mushroom foam \n\nOn weekdays they have $16 lunch specials that look like a really good deal.

        "text": "I visited Bulla over the weekend and had a good experience. I'm still struggling with changes in the new Covid environment so please consider that when reading this review. \n\nWe were initially seated at a high-top table and asked to be moved. The move went well with no noticeable annoyance by the host. Both servers we encountered were positive and not overbearing nor inattentive. They did a good job with service. \n\nI ordered the cannelloni and the chorizo stuffed dates. My boyfriend had the burger with patatas bravas. My boyfriend enjoyed the burger and agreed with me that the patatas bravas needed seasoning - a little garlic and salt would have gone a long way. To only depend on the sauces was a mistake, but the potatoes were perfectly cooked which is always a win. The cannelloni was good but needed some salt or heat to cut the fat, and it was all one texture which I'm not a fan of. Now.... I'm partial to any sweet and savory date dish so my favorite of the night were the chorizo stuffed dates. Perfect with textures and the mix of sweet and savory. I loved them and would go back exclusively for them. (I also had 2 lemon drop martinis that were well-prepared.)\n\nThe increase in prices everywhere has made me not want to go out. It's hard to spend more and be disappointed so going out is less desirable. I would expect tapas to be in the $7-$10 dollar range but Bulla is more of the $10-$20 range. This is not a true tapas experience. This is going out and having an appetizer as your meal. \n\nThis review is 4 stars because of the service we received and the 2 hour validated parking. The food is a solid 3.5 but would be a 4 for a person who likes less spice. Two hours was enough time for a couple on a date night but if there are 3-4 of you, I would expect to spend another hour or so here. \n\nYelp #19 2022",

        "text": "I've come here three times over the course of the past year - this time was because I was down the block and Urban Hai had just sold out of a lot of things and were closing for an hour and a half to recover from a League of Legends tournament. I knew Bulla was solid, and we'd already parked. \n\nLook, this place is very good, but I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back. Today, it was literally a football field away from where I wanted to try, and I figured I might as well give them a review while I'm at it.\n\nI would recommend the bacon wrapped dates, which were surprisingly delicious today. I forgot to take a photo before I inhaled them, but I also got some gazpacho, since I've never had it before. I knew it'd be cold, and it was, but it was somewhat better than I expected, very fresh, with a sprinkling of veggie chunks. I didn't finish it, because, although I was curious, it is basically just cold tomato soup. I also ordered a blueberry cocktail of some kind, because I'm secure in my masculinity.\n\nOn prior visits, I had the grilled octopus on crema de maiz, or whatever that cornmeal porridge is called. Anyways, that's good, as were all the drinks I've had here, but other than the dates, I don't know that there's anything really remarkable. \n\nService isn't fantastic - really the main drawback. Like, the servers are fine, relatively attentive and all, but it's hard to get them to seat you quickly even when the place is mostly empty. Food tends to come out staggered - a tuna tartar surprisingly took 10-15 minutes to arrive after the first dish, for instance.\n\nYou'll have a good meal here. The atmosphere is fairly nice, though a little worn in places. The music selection is more current, and it can get loud when it's crowded. I've gone back and forth between a 4 and a 5, but ultimately, Bulla is just very good, not great.",

        "text": "A fantastic place to get your \"taste\" on! \n\nThis is a topas place mainly.. small plates of interesting things to try and taste, great combinations of interesting flavors born on wings of inspiration... with a good selection of different culinary ideas.\n\nI love tapas places... they give me an opportunity to try all kinds of different things. And then if you like something you can get more of that!\n\nFirst the parking for this location can be confusing. Be sure to park in the right garage... it is the one on the same block, just up the hill, or you can't get validated.\n\nThe venue it's self is a good sized delightful location on the corner. It has an inviting atmosphere that is both relaxing and invigorating at the sane time. The air is just charged with an energy but the decor is sophisticated and calming. Truly a gem of a location.\n\nOur service was ok... just shortly after we got started with our drinks I saw our waitress walk out the door with her purse and keys. Surely she wasn't leaving without saying anything!? We waited a while and no service... a bit longer and no service... I finally asked another waitress if we could place our order with her. She was shocked when I told her our waitress walked out the door... she took our order and we were back in business.\n\nOur first round of tapas came out:\nMeat balls.. you get 5... do yourself a favor and order two of these from the get go... they are scrumptious!!\nPatatas bravas... a fried potato dish with a savory spicy sauce poured over the top. Again very good!\nGrilled steak... they forgot to season this or something. It was cooked well but there was zero flavor.\nMargarita flat bread... it was tasty but need to be cooked a bit more... the dough was not completely finished.\n\nAfter this round we tried some others:\nAnother meat ball... see just order two in the beginning!\nHam croquette with fig jam... fantastic! I loved the flavor combination!! The rest of my family didn't care for this but I loved it!\nGrilled octopus over cream corn... cooked very well but was missing any pop in flavor. Needed lemon juice and a little red peeper sauce.\nChorizo and queso... ohhhh my Goddie too hottie!! This was outstanding! From the bread to the queso! Just flat out wonderful!\n\nThen for desert we had the churros... pass on these... they are not worth the cost.\n\nBy the way our waitress did come back about half way through the meal. She had to go move her car from the meter she was parked at and then couldn't find another spot. Would have been nice for her to tell someone!\n\nWe enjoyed our meal here... it was pretty reasonable too. Everyone got to eat different things and enjoyed something if not multiple things. What a great find.",

        "text": "This place has a ton of potential, and I think their food is good and pretty consistent. This is the second time we've eaten there. Tried some new things like the grilled steak and the huevos 'Bulla', which were great. The garlic shrimp and the ham croquettes were decent. But man, the service is sooooo slow and not great at simple responsibilities. It's hard to write this review because the staff is super nice. After waiting 10 minutes for utensils after getting our first shared plates, I walked to the servers station and grabbed them myself. We had to flag down a server and ask for plates when we got another shared dish. When our dessert showed up, we weren't provided with spoons. When you spend $180 on a dinner for two, the expectation on the quality of service is just higher than what Bulla is able to provide. \n\nIn short, solid food, below average service, not a great value.",

        "text": "On our recent trip to Atlanta during a conference, we stumbled upon Bulla and what an unexpected delight it was! If you're looking for a brunch spot that offers both quantity and quality, this is it.\n\nWe dove straight into their three-item prefix menu for $30, and it was a culinary adventure worth every penny. Here's a little taste of our experience:\n\nCROQUETAS DE JAMON - If creamy and rich is your style, these are a dream. Every bite was an indulgent treat. I've been home from my trip for a week and am still raving about these!\nSMOKED SALMON MONTADITOS - My brunch partner vouched for these, and from the morsel I tried, they were really tasty!\nBIKINI - Picture a croque madame, then elevate it a notch. For fans of bechamel like myself, this dish is heaven on a plate. \nHUEVOS 'BULLA' - While this dish wasn't my cup of tea (I prefer a fork and knife style dish), my guest couldn't stop raving about it.\n\nFor the grand finale (that we were sadly too full to finish):\nBLUEBERRY & RICOTTA PANCAKES - Great\nHAZELNUT WAFFLES - Delicious!\n\nEven though the restaurant was bustling, the service remained attentive and prompt. A special mention for those who value comfort - we sat at the bar, and despite the crowd, we felt right at home.\n\nOne quirky note to remember: the restroom is located on the third floor. While it might seem a bit out of the way, there's an elevator for convenience.\n\nAll in all, Bulla offers a brunch experience that's a perfect blend of traditional tapas flavors with a modern twist. We're already planning our next visit!",

My favorite is definitely the ham croquettes and the octopus. As for brunch their hash and salmon montaditos are so good. Service is great too! I've had a couple of off experiences but they seemed really busy so I wasn't too worried. The restaurant has a nice ambiance.

So this is going off the food more than the service. \nWe started with drinks. I got the lavender margarita. It was tasty, but not very strong. Mostly tasted like juice. We got a few tapas and split them all. We got the margarita flatbread with one of the meats, chicken croquettes, ham croquettes, tuna tartare, albondigas, patatas bravas and a side of bread. It took a while for it to come out. The flatbread took forever. It was all very tasty though. Our favorites were the albondigas and the ham croquettes!",

It was strong but I feel it could have a little more fruit flavor. It tasted like red wine and brandy but nothing else. The food was really well seasoned and came out very quick. I never once looked for salt or pepper which is rare for me. \n\nCeviche was decent. My friend really enjoyed it! The Patatas Braves were pretty good. They were very generous with the sauce so if you like sauce, this is for you! Kale Caesar salad was pretty good as well. The kitchen was very generous with the cheese. I would suggest a touch more dressing, more croutons, and maybe giving the kale a quick massage prior to plating so it's not as tough. The sautéed garlic shrimp was my favorite dish! The shrimp were large, juicy, and perfectly snappy. Cooked perfectly. The garlic sauce was deeply flavorful and paired great with the bread that came with it. \n\nThe vibe here is perfect for a casual night out with a friend or a midweek date night. I am interested in trying more menu items the next time I go. Overall: 8.2/10 Would recommend!",

        "text": "Great experience. Quick brunch. Would recommend if you decide to go paella route to order that immediately when you sit down. \n\nParking is the 11th street parking that says it's $30/hour but it's validated if you go to any of the stores. The validation is good for 3 hours, so that should be plenty of time for you to get in and get out. I would have to say that made this place a lot more worth it, considering living in ATL parking is always something you have to sweat about.\n\nNow onto the food. we got the Patatas, the Sautéed Garlic Shrimp, and then for our main we just ordered two paellas. One brunch paella and one mixta. The appetizers (patatas and the garlic shrimp) were alright.  If I were to choose again which one to get again, I would have to say that the mixta is definitely I think better just for the fact that I think when eating the brunch paella that it was a bit too salty. However, I would have to say for us 4, we had plenty of left over from the paella. If you decide that you want a paella, you need to order that when you sit down because it takes some time for that to come out.\n\nOverall, Bulla isn't bad. I would say it's bit expensive, but the amount of food that you get is good especially for what I ordered. I think that's what was worth it for me which should have plenty of left overs. I would definitely come back, and with the free parking for 3 hours, I could say it's worth it.",

Maybe because the building and other buildings around it are condos and rentals. The waiter told me most of the clients live around the area. Not to digress...I started with their white sangria. Delicioso! Everything  tapas. I ordered for myself and to go for the hubby. See pictures for food comments. There's a steak tapas I ordered for hubby and he ate it so fast I didn't get to take a picture. He loved it he said! We enjoyed everything!! And the Great service is the icing! I'd return when I'm back in Atlanta. Price is reasonable.",

        "text": "A little disappointing. went for our 12 year anniversary last weekend.  We have been before and really enjoyed it but customer service and food quality has gone down since our last visit. \nHigh top tables were very uncomfortable, surprised we didn't get a better table with the early reservation made and with adding in that it was our anniversary to the notes. \nMost nicer places will add little touches or at least acknowledge it's a special occasion if you have added that info. \nDrinks - margarita was very bitter my husband had to drink it for me. His beer was room temp.. def not what you would want or expect when ordering a draft beer.  \nOrdered - steak with mushroom foam, came to the table luke warm and over cooked. Could tell it sat under the light for a while before it was brought to the table. \nGrilled shrimp were very bland, no flavor and very small sized shrimps for the price . \nOrdered the seafood paella and the flavor was great but was full of sand from the clams I'm guessing. We had sand throughout the entire dish and had to spit out multiple bites... not how you want the experience to go when you spend $45 for rice. \nTruffle pasta was so strong with truffles / truffle oil we couldn't even eat it. \nI knew it would have the truffle flavor and i usually love anything truffle i have ordered. This was the first time eating out where i could not take how strong the truffle flavor was. \nService to get our food and then to get a box / the check took forever. A manager ended up coming over and ask in if we needed anything and we let him know what we were waiting for and he brought the box and we had to still wait 10 mins or so for our server to bring the check. it was not busy at all, you could see the server walking around , checking her phone , focusing on new tables that walked in all while we are waiting for the check. \nonce she finally brought it she stood at the table watching us review the tab and pay. would have been nice to review our check to be sure everything was correct without feeling rushed. we waited over 20 mins for a box and check but are rusher when its time to pay and give a tip. \nwe left feeling disappointed in the whole experience and wishing we had chosen a different place to celebrate our special evening.",

There's a few options - they have a full menu option or a $30 per person 3 course fixed brunch menu. If you order the 3 course menu, mimosas are $3. It's a full portion menu and I had to take my last course to go because I was so full. The location is in midtown and they have outdoor seating, a small bar and inside tables. They also have an open kitchen set up which is cool. I thought the service was great. Everyone was friendly and the bartender Mike took great care of us. He was super busy but still kind - something that you don't always get. Full disclosure the restaurant was pretty packed and there was a point where the kitchen got backed up and we waited a long time in between courses. For us, not a big deal and these things happen. If you're a jerk, have no patience or genuinely had somewhere to be - this might make you annoyed.\n\nOkay the food! 'Croquetas De Jamon' WERE SO GOOD!! They paired it with a fig jam - game changer.  My boyfriend had the 'Garbanzo Frito'  and loved it. It's gluten free! I had the pork hash and it melts in your mouth. It had a good amount of garlic, which I'm usually not into, but the dish was so good I didn't care. Steak and eggs was good but we ordered it medium and it came out kinda well. I could see someone else possibly sending it back. Flavor was good though. Also, if you order steak and eggs from the fixed menu it's an extra $10. My boyfriend didn't have the last course cause the only gluten free option was flan and they were out. I ordered the blueberry pancakes but had to take them home. Overall we had a nice brunch and are definitely coming back for dinner!",

It isn't as good as I've had in the past. I've been here a number of times. Grill Pork Skewers -dry, difficult to get off the skewers; Patatas Bravas - OK; Sauteed Garlic Shrimp - yummy; Brisket Montaditos - Good; Grilled Octopus - most expensive and it was overdone, too burnt & hard\n\n***COST (OUT OF 4$):  $$$ sort of expensive for what it is. Be careful tapas plates add up, small plates means you have to order more. Wasn't cheap at all one tendril of octopus (which was overcooked) was $19.50. \n\n***DÉCOR: Trendy, high top tables, wood.  They need to do a deep cleaning, can see dust on the lights, ceiling tiles & ceiling speakers\n\n***SERVICE: Service was not good, server took our orders and basically ignored us after. I remember when they had friendly servers and had table side prep for a couple of the dishes.We also heard the servers at the counter behind the high top tables talking about the customers (saying how the couples at the bar have been only nursing their drinks and wasn't a big ticket).   \n\n***RECOMMEND: Ok recommdend if you're hungry and in the area, otherwise there are other places that do tapas better",

        "text": "After much anticipation, my husband and I went to this restaurant for the first time today. It has been on my list for years due to the amazing reviews\n\nThe first part of the experience was great. We love that they have free parking and reservations. The hosts were kind. The restaurant's ambiance is 10/10. Our appetizer (Croquetas de Jamón), my side (Patatas Bravas), and my dessert (Torrija) were delicious. Sadly, these things couldn't make up for everything else being terrible.\n\nWe only had about an hour before we needed to leave the restaurant to make it to a show. They were busy, so we asked the hosts if they thought the timeline was reasonable (so we could go somewhere else if it wasn't). They said: Yes, as long as you order quickly and don't order the paella (which has a minimum 30-minute wait).\n\nThe first time our waitress came to our table, we told her that we needed to leave in about an hour, and we ordered everything at once. We went with their \"Brunch Prix Fixe\" menu.\n\nOur appetizer came out quickly. Our entrees took quite a while. My entree (Bulla Burger) came out about 10 - 15 minutes before my husband's entree (Braised Pork Hash). My dessert was brought at the same time as my entree, so by the time I got to it, the ice cream was completely melted.\n\nI finished my entree and dessert before my husband even got his entree. Once he finally got it, it was terrible. He described it as: Tasteless. I didn't try it, but it didn't look good at all. My burger was underwhelming to say the least. \n\nMy husband's dessert never came, even though we asked about it multiple times. We had already paid, so we paid for a dessert we didn't get.\n\nWe had to constantly seek out our waitress for EVERYTHING: refills, boxes, the check, etc. Oh, and our check was incorrect. There was an extra item on it. So that took about another 10 minutes to correct.\n\nAt first, we thought this would be a restaurant that we would fall in love with and frequent. Now, due to the terrible service, bland entrees, etc., we doubt we'll be back. Very disappointing. I wish we could have our $70 back.",
