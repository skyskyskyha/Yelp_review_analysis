Atmosphere was nice & so was the decor.\nWe ordered various items:\nfalafel (they were okay, my family enjoyed them more than me); hummus duo w/ tabouleh (the black bean hummus & traditional hummus were delicious! The servings were kind of small & the tabouleh was okay); 6 spice potatoes (they were good); lamb chops (fantastic as always & the reason I come to Divan - it's the only thing I've ever ordered); blackened verlasso salmon (family member said it was good & really enjoyed it); lamb shank (family member said it was good & really enjoyed it); & spice blend shish kabob (family member said it was good & really enjoyed it).\nOur server was Shama & she was very nice, a little talkative but still very sweet,  & helpful. The only thing I didn't like is when it came time for the check to be paid the waitress stands over your shoulder. I always tip well, & don't need suggestions on how to tip, so that was a little annoying. \nOverall, I'll be back because the food is as wonderful as the service! Our interaction with staff, from the moment we entered the door until we left, was top notch.\nParking is valet for $10.",

Courtney told us we were a walk-in, but we had a reservation and the screenshot as proof. She told us that she was the only manager that we could speak with. She appeared annoyed at our presence.\n\nIn addition, she seemed dismissive and unknowledgeable about the restaurant's history because it's historically known, in Atlanta. Much to my chagrin, when we asked if we could go upstairs, we were told the servers won't make money on the upper levels of the restaurant. We left disappointed, hungry, and confused. 0-5",

We had about a part of 9 and we were seated rather fast. The inside of this place is beautiful. It would be great for a date night. \nOur server's name was Sadie and she was nothing but amazing. She handled our party very well and took our picture. The food runners were slightly confused with who's food belonged to who and some weren't for our table. That was the only minor issue but this wouldn't stop me for going back of course.\nMy food was great as well. We ordered falafel for an appetizer and shared between three of us. My salmon pasta was seasoned perfectly. \nOverall we had a great time and I hope to be served by Sadie again.",

And we came right when the restaurant opened so we had options to seat inside or on the patio. We opted for the patio. While I waited for a friend, I sat at the bar to chat it up and the bartender recommended a wine for me that I had not tried before and it was legit. Pomegranate wine! Whew! There's valet parking available in front of the restaurant for five bucks so bring cash. Although in this digital world, they might take cash app or something. And unfortunately they don't do any happy hour specials. Overall, it was a good Thursday evening. I can only imagine what the weekends are like. Especially since it's located in Buckhead.",

Great for dates and birthday celebrations! The location is very spacious!! Valet parking but you can easily find a stare at Park on Peachtree for the low!!\n\nOverall 10/10 will come again!!",

        "text": "I've been to Divan several times, but this is my first time at this location since their move. They have some of the best Lamb Chops in the city. Although the new location is impressive, there were several things that impacted my experience.\n\n- Service:  5/10 We arrived for our reservation about 5 minutes early. I didn't necessarily care for where they seated us (right in the aisle way from the kitchen) and requested we be moved elsewhere, which they willingly did and we appreciated. However, it then took our server anywhere from 10-15mins to acknowledge us. There's also a 2hr limit per reservation and dress code doesn't seem to be strictly enforced. Our sever was friendly though and apparently hadn't been notified that we were now in his section. He also wasn't very attentive throughout the course of our dinner.\n\nOur seat was in a better spot but located near a door directly connected to the kitchen area (open concept) where the food was being plated. Before our food even came out, we noticed a fly pestering another table that eventually came over to our table when our food did come out, and a gnat that tried to climb into one of our wine glasses. I was also a bit turned off at seeing some of the staff walk into this same door directly from the walkway near valet with McDonald's drinks left right near the plates and the same area where the guests' food was being plated and put onto trays to be served. They stayed there for the remaining 1hr 30 we were seated, with one being placed directly on the shelf near some unused plates. I also didn't think it was very professional or sanitary to see staff use their bare hands to add garnishing onto peoples plates. It's super easy to subconsciously touch something that's been contaminated, so I'm surprised gloves aren't required here especially when the kitchen is in eyeshot of several guest tables.\n\n- Food: 10/10  I always get the lamb chops here and as usual, they didn't disappoint. My boyfriend didn't care for the Crab Risotto Croquettes. I enjoyed them, but we were both surprised at the size/portion.\n\nThe new location is great as well as the food, but the level of service is not on par with that I've experienced in the past with this restaurant (This seems to be an ongoing trend with restaurants in Atlanta these days). All in all, a great Friday dinner destination spot depending on when you go.",

We first tried the restaurants at Colony Square they were all booked, so we decided to try the castle on the hill, Divan's. You've passed by it numerous times and never went in, so I decided to do it for you. (LOL) Divan's is multilevel, 4 floors, which encompasses a private dining room, a hookah lounge, a bar, so many cozy and quaint rooms. Divan's is casual with a touch of chic, the food creatively yummy.  My guest had slow cooked lamb shank with saffron, fava beans and dill balsamic rice.  I had blackened verlasso salmon with oyster mushrooms, linguine alfredo., oh I also had cardamon tea, so good!\n\nWe passed on dessert, it was time to head on over to the Alliance Theatre.  I'm excited to revisit so I can try their desserts and explore more floors, I hope to see you there.",

        "text": "The cool historical structure sets an inviting tone. Service was top notch. The crab rice ball appetizer was delicious. It was a fair portion for one but too scant for two. But things were different for the entrees. Four of some of the largest scallops I've ever seen, most restaurants would serve three of these and get away with it -- so that was a bonus. They were perfectly cooked, and although I did want a little more flavor from the sauce (which maybe was just a little too subtle for my tastes), I'd still giving the dish five stars because four would be too low. The cauliflower side dish was perfectly seasoned and cooked, so believe your waitperson if they recommend it. The roasted potatoes I got as a side were two steps above most roasted tater sides, topped with bits of extra tasty diced aromatics. My wife's steamed PEI mussels were delicious and expertly prepared. All thumbs up.",

        "text": "I threw myself a birthday party at Divan about a week ago. I had never been but a good friend highly recommended it. I was looking for a sophisticated spot with good drinks, hookah lounge, and good food. Divan had all of these, and I was more than satisfied with my experience. Here's an all-inclusive snapshot of my night there(if you've got a minute):\n\nPulled up to the spot and they've got $10 valet service. The valets were on point but they had me go across the street to pick up my car (not cool).\nThe doorman is definitely good at his job, and always had the door ready coming and going.\nThe hostesses were a bit snobby. Definitely beautiful to look at, though.\nThe place may have been a house and might even be historical. There were 4 floors. Bottom two had open bars and dining. Third floor was the hookah floor with private rooms (where I was at) and open dining. The top floor I didn't know much about but super high status up there (so I assumed). A few of us chilled at the second floor bar before the party and the ambiance and vibe was just right. Lights were a bit dim, the crowd is enjoying themselves, and it had a very positive feel. I loved it.\nMy attendant to the room (G) was on point. He provided excellent service, understood how to take care of my guests, and was agreeable to my requests without hesitation. I won't go into the details but he and his staff went above and beyond that night.\nThe room was definitely relaxed and intimate. We had control of the thermostat, lighting, and could keep the door closed. Hookahs we're burning all night, the Mediterranean cuisine was probably up there with the best in the city (the lamb was incredible!), and the cocktails were outstanding. By the end of the night everyone was really enjoying themselves and no one wanted to leave.\nFinally, I want to thank misdee, the event coordinator. I contacted her through the Divan website and she responded within the hour. She was available and responsive anytime I called or emailed her. I was in contact with her on and off up until the event and she was very cool, helpful, knowledgeable, and willing to work with me during the entire process. There was never any confusion between us about the contract, what was included, any adjustments, or the bill. She certainly has the skills to plan an event and she means business. I wouldn't waste her time or Divans unless you're serious.\nAll in all, expect a great experience all around because that's what my guests and I had and what you deserve. Definitely going back! 5",

Our server (I believe it was Silas) was amazing & made sure to check on us regularly even though it was quite busy . The ambiance is nice! We used to go to the old location but this is bigger & better with 2 or 3 levels . There's a parking deck right next door & it was $15. Overall, wonderful place!",

For the entree I had the salmon which was in the top 3 reccomendations by the bar tender.  Cooked perfectly.  I ended with the Persian donuts.  Even though I was full I ate them all.  The grand marnier was the kicker.  Service was okay.  So convenient to the Arts center so I will definitely go again before a performance.",

        "text": "Wow, this is one of the best meals I've had out in a while. I've been dining out frequently these days and to be honest they've all be letting me down sadly... but Divan really showed up.\n\nMy friend and I shared Turkey meat balls, The Duck leg Confit and the Lamb Shank. \n\nThe Turkey meat balls was fantastic. It was perfectly creamy with some texture and also the tomatoes and onions on top were great. They also give you unlimited bread to go with it. Delicious.\n\nThe Lamb Shank truly wowed me. I love Lamb but have eaten way too many overcooked Lamb at restaurants before. This was not the case with the Lamb here. It was moist and it felled of the bone. Also, perfectly salted.\n\nService was great, staff is kind and attentive! The only downside is the cocktails not up to par, but the General Manager came say hi and explained that they're about to launch a craft cocktail program, very experienced and professional individual and also a certified sommelier, He recommended a glass of wine that really hit the spot instead of the overly sweet taste less Strawberry margarita!\n\nI'm so happy we got to eat here - I had dinner with a friend but I'm planning on coming again with my spouse.\n\nAlso, my Persian friends said they love this spot so that's all I really need to confirm this place is legit!",

The ambience is perfect for a date night! However, if you want to go with family, then I will suggest to reserve table 1 because it can accommodate up to 5 people and is in a separate room from the main dining area. The manager and the servers are very welcoming. \n\nEach and every dish we ordered turned out really tasty. Sadly, they didn't have a vegetarian option on their entree menu but that wasn't a problem at all because they have a delicious falafel appetizer and various veggie sides. I was well satisfied with my entree of Bakhtiyari kabob as the meat was tender and flavorful. Please be careful with their hot sauce because even though it is tasty, it is extremely hot. \nThe best part of the dinner experience was the dessert! When our server said there will be a 15 minutes cooking time for their most popular dessert, I was going to ask for the check but then I thought of giving it a try. I am so glad I waited and tried it, the saffron ice cream was mind blowing and the chocolate tarragon cake was heaven! I would go back any day for this cake.",
