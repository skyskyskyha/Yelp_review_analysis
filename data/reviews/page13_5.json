        "text": "For one the food is great. I had the yellow tail appetizer (the great wave?) solid 8/10. Would order again. And then I got the tempura roll (salmon and yellowtail?) that was nice 7/10 and the drink was great the lychee pearl 9/10. I would give this place a higher rating but I was by myself sat at the bar and the bartenders took like 10 minutes to even look in my direction and when the guy did finally see me he forgot to key in my order. So it did take a hot minute for me to even get a water. Other than that I think the restaurant itself is busy. I had a reservation, probably best to stick with a reservation. Also they add a 18% gratuity for parties under 4 so keep that in mind as well. The actual venue itself if pretty nice. If I come back it will probably be as a date. The dress code is also all over the place as well.",

        "text": "I'm shocked at the 4.2-star rating of this place because my experience was outstanding. From the delicious King Crab Fried Rice, which lived up to its social media hype, to the excellent service, and beautiful decor, this restaurant exceeded our expectations. There were so many tempting entrees, like the Drunken Man Spaghetti and Egg Crepe Pad-Thai Lobster, but I had my heart set on King Crab Fried Rice. It had a generous portion of crab fried rice and the crab cluster was huge. It also came with a Cajun Butter that I didn't think was necessary, and kind of fought with the seasoning already on the crab, but it was delicious nonetheless. My boyfriend selected the braised short rib that came with a side of mashed potatoes and carrots. He enjoyed his meal and I enjoyed the bite I tasted.  For dessert, I chose the Thai mousse cheesecake which surprised me with its creamy texture and perfect balance of sweetness.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant, adorned with captivating Asian decor, adds to the dining experience, whether for an intimate meal or a gathering with friends. The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive. \n\nWithout a doubt, I'll be returning!",

I would say overall they were 6/10. \n\nThere were a total of 4 vegetarian dishes, so very little option but you can always ask them to alter. We had tofu fried rice and it was okay. Nothing exceptional. \n\nThe place itself is pretty! Really aesthetically appealing and incorporated many cultural elements of a Thai restaurant. Parking is validated through license plate and the garage is behind their restaurant.",

They did not disappoint. They have parking behind the building which is great. Free for the first three hours. Our server was very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. The food!!!! When I say everything was good, I mean that!  I had the drunken man spaghetti which i ended up eating it all when I got home. I did try my aunts snapper and I am going back for that. Best one I have had in awhile. The decor is super cute and intimate. Smaller than I expected but it doesn't feel overwhelming. This place is absolutely worth a try.",

The sushi is plated in which a unique way and the the drinks are creative. Giving you an experience, you won't forget! \n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful. It's very tranquil yet lively. You feel completely immersed in culture, it's the small details you must pay attention to. They do play music but it kind of blends with the noise of the restaurant so you aren't struggling to hear someone speak. \n\nI've been to Osha on several different occasions; brunch, lunch, date night, work event and a girl's day out. This restaurant embodies all those vibes.\n\nThe service here is top tier. Like you're never going to be looking for your server. Food always comes out fresh and hot. The hostess always tries to seat you as soon as possible if you don't have reservations. The waitstaff don't mind explaining the menu and offering suggestions. \n\nLet's get into the eats. The food, man the FOOD! I have yet to be disappointed. Some of my favorites are the Crab Fried Rice, Seafood Boil, Shrimp Tempura, Crispy Red Snapper, Crab Cakes, The P.E.I Mussels, The King of the Sea, and The Lobster Roll.\n\n**If you don't see any sushi you like on the menu, you can tell them what you want, and they will make it. It's an Osha hack. Lol. **\n\n\nThe parking is validated so don't forget to grab your tag number on the way in!",

My son had the beef dish while\nVery tender again way too much sauce that took away from the flavors of the meat and the majority of the meat was FAT. I had the Pad Thai noodles way too rubbery and salty and the drinks were also mediocre. I wouldn't go back but wouldn't discourage anyone from giving them a try.",

        "text": "Lovely restaurant that was recommended to me by a local! There's plenty of space both inside and out, and the interior is both uniquely and ornately decorated. They validate parking for you, and on the weekends they serve brunch and bottomless mimosas.\n\nI wish they had more non-alcoholic beverage options, but Thai tea was available and delicious too. Their brunch menu consists of traditional breakfast dishes with a flare of seafood. The waffles were impressive in size, but I thought their regular menu had better food options. Gyozas are great to share and the King of the Sea was beautiful in presentation! The roll itself was pretty good, though the side of soft shell crab tempura was not my favorite. \n\nI thought the dishes were a bit overpriced but had a pleasant experience overall! Server was nice enough to help split the bill among our table of 4.",

Here, osha falls short in my opinion. The presentation is absolutely on point, but the actual quality of the food is lacking.

You know how some restaurants just have \"stuff\" with no real rhyme or reason? This place has rhyme and reason! \n\nThe menu...my goodness the menu the menu. Such great choices. Some traditional Thai and then Thai with flavor. I opted for lobster and waffle. That's right lobster. It was amazing! I also had Thai tea also very good.

I don't remember the last time a restaurant did that for just 2 ppl",

I ended up ordering the same drink, can't remember the name but it was amazing and I ordered the same sushi, it was just as amazing and would order them both again. My entree was sorry to say just ok, it wasn't bad just not to my liking. I would go back for sure and I definitely recommend everyone give them a try at least once.

They have a parking deck in the back, as you enter the restaurant you can validate your parking with your license plate number. The ambiance of the restaurant is super pretty. My partner and I ordered 2 rolls to start, then ordered more. Ended up ordering 4 total: Van Gogh, impression sunshine, Siam Ruby, and the Yayoi. My favorite was the Van Gogh. Their alcoholic drinks looked very good, but opted to just drink water. They brought out a complimentary slice of cheesecake for dessert to celebrate the birthday. Overall good experience.",

The plating & drinks were cute too.! \n\nParking was very efficient. There is a designated parking garage adjacent to the building, & Osha validates your parking for 3 hrs. Do not pay at the machine in the garage, just take a note of your tag & they will validate it in the restaurant! \n\nOur server Alexandra was very sweet & knowledgable of the menu. She was attentive & accommodating. We really enjoyed her service.\n\nFood was pretty good! Portions on the entree's were good. Love that they allow meat substitutions in their entrees. \nI had the seafood pasta, chicken dumplings, deep down sushi, & Thai tea. \nFood was actually quite delightful. I enjoyed the pasta. It's more of a sweet curry. Sushi was a hint bit salty, but good. Crab cakes were on the smaller side, but tasty. \n\nThey brought out a complimentary dessert for the birthday gal, & that was a nice touch. \nWe enjoyed our time here.! \nOverall, I'd probably return.",

My sushi was so fresh and delicious and ordered a drink which was super cute and good. My friends also ordered some sushi and we all got different ones and tried each others and love it !! Service was also great and the experience was all I asked for ! It is a little pricy but worth the price, my favorite dish was the coconut soup.",

This is definitely a new entry on \"my spot\" list. \n\nEven though I was toasting alone with my glass of H2O, my girls drinks not only presented well, but passed the test!\n\nAll three of us were happy with our food selections & apps: sushi, crab cakes, calamari, salt & pepper shrimp, drunken spaghetti, & fried rice.",

Like don't even try it and waste your time. This is a super vibey cute date night or girls night out spot so walking in is probably only cool for the bar early in the evening. They tag team service here so there's always someone close by refilling your drink or getting you an app, so you know that means the gratuity is already included in the bill... it's totally worth it tho so whatevs.\n\nEvery single thing we ate was fabulous as always, but The Great Wave remains the singular most delicious bite I've had in Atlanta.

The ambience in the restaurant is really calming and beautiful, day or night. The music is never loud, the staff never seem stressed, and it's always calming to me because of how it's decorated. Their reservation system is straightforward and they validate parking as well.\n\nBottomless Mimosas - they have i think 4-5 different juices for the mimosas and our server kept our glasses full.\nGyoza - always a consistent hit\nButter Shrimp Tempura - these shrimp sticks are fried to perfection, light and crisp on the outside.\nCalamari - Thai restaurants have the best calamari. Idk what magic it is, but it's just true.\nLobster Tail & Waffle - Listen, Linda. If you like Lobster, get this. The waffle is lightly sweet, so goes really well if you like to eat the lobster meat and waffle in the same bite. Highly recommend!\nKing Lobster roll (i think) - this role is large and even comes with shrimp tempura on the side.\nDaVinci roll - my friend really enjoyed this! I believe it has smoked salmon on it.\nSalt & Pepper Shrimp\n\nI always have a great time and highly recommend it!\n\nAlso, because we were there really close to brunch ending and the restaurant closing, we saw the staff setting up for a family-style meal to eat. How lovely - loved that!",

The restaurant is small and intimate so it makes sense that they do it like that. Parking is in a garage they will validate it for 3 hours. Don't make the mistake I did and forget to give them your license plates numbers in the beginning. (My car was fine ) They will not seat you until your party has arrived. \n\nFor drinks, they have cute cocktails- I had the lychee pearl and champagne. For appetizers, we had  Brussels sprouts with goat cheese, steamed dumplings, fried dumplings, calamari, golden triangle and sleeping Venus rolls. My favorite were the Brussels sprouts. Everything was really tasty. \n\nFor entrees we had the King crab fried rice, parpadelle seafood pasta, ribeye, Lobster pad Thai, Drunken noodle. Everyone's food tasted great. \n\nWe were celebrating a birthday. They brought us a slice of cheesecake with a candle.\n\nService was great.

It does get crowded. I would suggest arriving early to give yourself time to possibly wait for spot. Parking is free. You walk out the garage around to the street entrance to Osha.\n\nThere's a beautiful Osha sign when you enter. Decor at entrance makes for great photos. Suggest making a reservation for sure at least a week in advance. It gers crowded as the night goes on.\n\nWe were seated immediately. The server came over within minutes. I was looking at the decor, just beautiful. He suggested the green beans, and I wanted calamari. The way he described the green beans made it a must. They were sooo good. Try them when you visit.\n\nDrinks we went with Geisha and Apple Pie Old Fashioned. Both drinks came out on interesting drink stands. The Geisha was really good. I ended up having two. The flavor profile was on point. \n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Salt and pepper shrimp with side of fried rice and Special fish entree with side of rice. I ordered my son the Golden fish and chips to go. My fish was so delicious and flavorful. I ate every bite. I ate all my food. Lol. Perfect portion sizes. My friend shrimp was good too. We had zero complaints. We debated ordering more green beans to go.\n\nIt was a bit smaller than I thought. However, it's longer not as wide. The restaurant is beautiful. It was a great experience. I did spend think $100 solo. However, I got my money's worth.",

Parking was a little confusing for me, but they validate for you in the restaurant. \nTwo of my friends and I went for dinner and ordered a table full of food and shared. Everything was pretty delicious, except for the crab cakes. Which they should call crab bites. They tasted more like stuffing, than crab cakes. \nCalamari wasn't over cooked so good, muscles had a delicious sauce on them, gyoza was delicious and fresh, salt and pepper shrimp was so good and fresh, king crab fried rice and crab legs was amazing, and my cocktails was ON POINT!!! No disappointment with all of that food! I can't wait to go back and try other things!!",

Lol the sweet spicy balance (you can get it without the spice as well) the curry, calamari, shrimp, mussels! 10/10! \n\nWe also had the Mango Sake and it was delicious as well ! \n\nThe calamari  crunchy balance, but soggy or salty at all! Just perfect! \nPlease kiss the chef for me! \n\nThe service was amazing\nThe ambiance is perfect...the music isn't too loud but you can still vibe and enjoy your food. The place isn't crowded at all and guess what else...THEY VALIDATE YOUR PARKING. You don't even have to go to the machine. Take a picture of your license plate and they'll handle the rest! \n\nThe only annoying part was 18% gratuity was already added in. It always makes me feel weird if I don't leave a tip when I see gratuity already added but our waitress deserved the extra so we paid her more with no grief! \n\n\nI loved my experience and I really can't wait to go back ! \nI want this place to do well but ima cry if they get packed out",

I thought the crab meat would be mixed within the rice but they just placed it on top. The crab meat was a bit salty but once you mix it with the rice it doesn't taste as bad because the rice as no salty lol. I wasn't a fan of the fried rice so I wouldn't get it again. \n\nThe shrimp tempura app was pretty good. It wasn't covered with too much batter. \n\nThe staff is very polite and nice.

We ordered almost every appetizer on the menu in the video I'm attaching with my review you'll see a table full of appetizers. My personal favorite was the muscles in the sauce that came with it  .  To DIE FOR - next up was the calamari  the sauce that came with it was a sweet chili sauce. I had a glass of Grigio, but others at the table ordered some of their specialty cocktails. I tasted most of them, and all the cocktails were very good. There was one drink that was a little strong, and I can't remember the name of it, but we did ask for some additional purée, and it made the drink sweeter for my friend. The atmosphere is very date night as far as ambience. There was a lot of couples and girl groups it gave grown and sexy. I didn't use the bathroom during our time there, so I can't state the cleanliness of that but the table service was very well. They didn't leave your table, cluttered, or covered or anything of the such.  I was just was super friendly and knowledgeable. I did taste some sushi. It was also really good. I cannot remember the name of the Roll. The menu is very fairly priced as well, it's not overly expensive. I really enjoyed my time and experience here and I would definitely come back for a date night.",

So I guess if you're willing to take chance for the sushi go but I wouldn't order anything else",

We had one reservation of 4 and one of 2 and wanted to sit together, she explained she couldn't do that and didn't even ask or try. We understood so we asked to at least find 2 tables next to each other but that was also not possible. \nIt's very hard to come back to a restaurant that doesn't appreciate the effort it is to spend $700 on one dinner for a regular Saturday, there are plenty of restaurants in Atlanta that would love our business.\nThe food and our server was very nice so we ended up having a nice dinner but will not be coming back.",

The service was fast and my server was patient with us (I and my friends were indecisive). And the dumplings?? I could eat 15 of them! The ambiance was very engaging except for some customers that were really loud. I didn't give them a 5 star because of the NO APPLE PAY policy. That was very very inconvenient for me but was sorted. Thank God Chile. I will be back to try so much sushi",

        "text": "Oh my goodness. This food is sooo good.  My friend got the Red snapper and I got the salmon.  Everything was so tasty.  The green beans were grilled maybe?? But the we're seasoned like I've never tasted. Moving forward whatever dish I get I will swap the veggies out for those green beans!!  it's a good amount of food.  As far as my salmon I probably would have gotten it done medium well but my friend ordered while I went to the restroom and she ordered it well done. While it was not melting in my mouth it was also not tough. It came with a nice sauce and white rice.  Now I generally don't eat white rice but in order to get all the sauce I had to put the rice in it.  The red snapper though..crispy and seasoned well. Its really the kind of dish you need to eat at home so you can really go to work!! \n\nCustomer service was super. From the hostess to our server to whoever the gentleman was that we spoke with before leaving everyone was great!!  I made a reservation but my event went long and we were late..still within the 15 minute grace period so we were seated immediately. I heard them tell someone on the phone it was an hour wait.  I can't wait to go back. They have brunch on the weekends. Make sure you remember your tag number..that's how they validate your parking.",
