        "text": "Had a 7PM reservation.  Did not get seated until 7:45.  They seemed to have no system in place to be aware of who was waiting for what table.  They did not communicate what you should do while waiting, so everyone stayed cramped in the main entrance because you did not know if you could go to bar an wait.  The hostess were overwhelmed and annoyed when you would ask them how much longer it would be.  Valet also 10 minute wait to even park.  Food is very very good.  Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable.  They seem to have front-end issues with over-booking and it kills the whole experience.  Not a single \"We are sorry you waited 45 minutes when you had a reservation\"",

        "text": "An absolutely stunning restaurant from the decor, employees, food, and to the drinks. Definitely earned the recommendation by Michelin. We did not have a reservation, and luckily did not have to wait at all! We were swiftly seated by the host then shortly greeted by the server. \n\nThe drinks were fragrant and was SO good! I ordered the Spice Trade (& shamefully forgot what my friend had) and was amazed by the fragrant cocktail. For an appetizer to share we split the Mesabecha Hummus which came with Taftoun bread and pretty much cleaned off the plate. We loved it so much we almost ordered another serving. For our entrees, we had the Salmon Kookoo and Koobideh & Egg which were both delightful - made to perfection with refreshing sides. We also had a serving of the Tumeric Barbari and that was a perfect ending to our time with Delbar. This is probably the best restaurant for Middle Eastern food I've had here in Atlanta besides homemade food. \n\nI enjoyed our time at this location and look forward to visiting the one in Alpharetta.",

Even sitting outside in the winter is great because of the heaters and blankets. \n\nThe dill labneh is a must have for sure. There's no reason to not get this. We split a lot of our foods. We got the chinjeh which is the best cut of meat they have in my opinion. They had a lamb tahcheen that night and that was really tasty! I had been craving it. And the kale and pear salad was refreshing. I also loved the baklava ice cream for dessert. The tea service they had was a great pomegranate and chia seed tea and I'd also recommend that!",

Delbar is a Middle Eastern restaurant serving a variety of cuisines including Iranian, Lebanese, and Turkish. So it was really easy to Eat Tha World in here! It's easy to see why they're on the Michelin guide.\n\nThe decor is stunning! Beautiful Middle Eastern elements and music throughout. They offer some tucked away seating a covered indoor-outdoor area, a bar, a regular outdoor area with fans and heat lamps as needed. We sat in the covered outdoor space, which was beautiful on a cold winter and overcast day. I forgot I was in Inman Park for a bit!\n\nWe had amazing service and food.  The mushroom peynirli pide was one of the best things I've eaten in my life, the Baklava ice cream sandwich is the most sinful sweet treat. We did experience a minor issue with one item but the manager and the chef rectified it quickly -- 5 star service on their parts. \n\nWe ate the following things communal style:\n-Chinjeh & eggs \n-KooKoo sabzi \n-Shroom peynirli pide and\n-Baklava Ice Cream Sandwiches  \n\nThe next time I'm home, I'll be back for dinner",

        "text": "Came here with friends for dinner sometime around Thanksgiving. One of them had been here before and had been raving about it. And I would have to agree, I had a great time! The atmosphere is very laid back and the decor. The food is amazing - would recommend family style-ing it and sharing \nI think the only thing is next time I will not order as much as I have a small appetite (and so did another person at our table) and although it was recommended we order more dishes for our party (which we did), we had ample food for all four of us and probably could have done fine without the additional 1-2 dishes. My favorite dip will probably have to be the apricot/fig labneh! It's so smooth and just mildly sweet and super delicious!",

        "text": "This is actually my third time eating at this establishment and I am finally writing review. First time was last year 2023 for Father's Day. My family brought me here and I fell in love with this place.\n\nEvery time I've come, I sat at the bar and had a great time mingling with the bartenders and learning some of their specialty drinks. This time is in the afternoon so I had a light beer to go with the rest of my delicious food to start they have their cultural starter , which would be the equivalent of a basket of bread and other places. The cheese, radish, nuts, greens, and bread are all meant to open up the pallet and prepare you for decadence.\n\nThere's nothing that we ate that we did not enjoy the tiger shrimp was absolutely delicious. The only thing I would change, I rather have all that great sauce on the actual shrimp and not the shell, because I found myself rubbing the shrimp on the outside of the shell to get some of that great char flavor of it. we ordered a hummus type spread that had eggplants and some onions in there and oh my God I could have swirled my finger in that bowl just to eat it all up. It was so delicious. We pair the spread with the cultural bread and by that time we were already getting full.\n\nNext, was the real reason we love this place, the rice! My Family and I are Caribbean people and rice and beans are a staple of our diet. Oh my young baby Jesus, there is no rice I have tasted/ eaten on planet Earth, quite like this. You can literally eat the entire mound of rice by yourself. If I was a dog, I would be growling at my wife for making me share the rice how absolutely delicious it was (she would be growling right back). The chicken kabobs are like ever other kabobs... but everything else is definitely a stand out. It's good for date nights it's good for groups, the ambience is beautiful. Apologies I didn't take any pictures, but the setting is absolutely beautiful and there is indoor and outdoor seating. The people in staff were also very nice people and inviting.\n\nWe will definitely be back to indulge ourselves again.",

        "text": "YES DELBAR YES. I'm always skeptical of super hyped places, even Michelin Guide ones, because I think restaurants can sometimes get a big ego and stop putting in the work. Delbar is not one of those places.\n\nWe tried to make reservations for a Friday night the day before which was not smart as it was basically full except for odd times. However, my friend was able to call on the day of and they were able to kindly squeeze us in with a strict 1.5 hour reservation. Amazing! \n\nThe location is stunning. We sat in the covered patio which had a really nice ambiance. However, it was HOTTTT in there. It was super cold outside so I was dressed pretty warmly and I will say I was overheating and slightly uncomfortable. So maybe just wear layers? \n\nService was TOP NOTCH - I don't know if all the servers are like this but ours was super personable, hilarious, and made us feel right at home. He offered many suggestions and checked on us many times to make sure we were having a good time. The drinks were great, I had two of the \"We'll Always Have Paris.\" I was skeptical because of the mezcal, but it was perfect and not too overpowering.\n\nFor food, we ordered the hummus with mushrooms + egg yolk, the muhamarra, the lamb ribs, and the adas polo. Everything was amazing but the hummus absolutely blew me away. The egg yolk was one of the best additions to hummus I've had maybe ever. It was creamy and decadent and just EVERYTHING. \n\nWe left extremely full with leftovers (FYI - the tahdig portions are huggeeee and can easily feed 4-5 people). I wish we had room for dessert because they also looked phenomenal. \n\nSplitting the bill was super easy as you can pay with your phone if you wish and either split the bill in half or pay for certain items.",

        "text": "PARKING:\nParking is TOUGH here especially on Friday nights & weekends! Try to carpool or Uber. \n\nRESY: \nI highly recommend you make a resy, especially on Friday nights & weekends. It's usually packed so you can try to walk in, but you'd only be able to sit at the bar & there is usually a long wait for that. \n\nAMBIANCE:\nThey have indoor & outdoor seating. Obviously outdoor seating is less comfortable during the peak winter & summer months. They have heaters during winter, but it's still VERY COLD. It's cute & simple modern decor and has a very \"HOME-Y\" feel to it. It also smells amazing the moment you walk inside! \n\nFOOD:\n$0 FREE BREAD & SNACKS: upon arrival they bring you complimentary naan-type bread accompanied with fresh mint, feta cheese, radishes, and some pecans to munch on before your apps arrive.\n\n$14 ADANA BITE (appetizer): flatbread, lamb/beef kabob on top with onions & sauce. It was DELICIOUS! I almost could've just eaten this as my main. \n\n$7.50 (half order) DILL LABNEH DIP: I LOVE that they let you do a half order of any of their SPREADS! Especially if you are only ordering for one person it's much more manageable. This one was one of the most popular & delish! Like Tzatziki, refreshing but had a crunch in it - I assume some sort of nut? \n\n$29 LAMB KABOB: this had about 5 pieces of lamb, cooked medium. I ordered a side of the GARLIC TOUM (whipped garlic spread) and it was Devine! It's a lot of meat, I had leftovers. \n\n$5 GARLIC TOUM DIP: they recommend one of the dips for the protein kabobs. I'm a sauce person so I love them all! \n\nDRINKS:\n$15 EY JOONAM: a vodka based drink, was light & refreshing. I'd definitely order this again! \n\n$15 SPICE TRADE: a gin based drink. This one definitely had more flavor than the EY JOONAM, but it just depends what you're in the mood for. Not super floral as most gin drinks are. I liked this drink the best. \n\nOVERALL:\nIt was a great first experience here! I got lucky as a walk in and immediate seats at the bar. Next time I'll make a resy and see what it's like at the tables. Will def be back to try the rest of the items on their menu. Chic & trendy spot with great food - go check it out!",

Even while waiting, the staff were attentive, asking if we wanted to at least order apps or get drinks while we waited to be seated. I ordered the salmon kebab with the salmon appetizer.

        "text": "10s ACROSS THE BOARD!!! This restaurant is a a WHOLE vibe!! Middle Eastern vibe that is! When you walk in, you're immediately greeted by the hostesses and you can feel the amazing energy. Middle Eastern music is playing throughout and the atmosphere is very upbeat. The decor is spot on with lots of Persian-style area rugs on the floor, large plants, and low ambient lighting! It's kind of loud as there is lots of conversations and \"Ooooh's and Ahhhh's\" happening around us! But it didn't bother me. \n\nNow for the amazing food!! Absolutely DELICIOUS!! Everything understood the assignment!! We started with the Omani shrimp! They bring you 4 Tiger Prawns seasoned to perfection with this delicious yogurt based sauce that is to die for! Be prepared to have messy hands but they do bring you a warm towel with lemon to clean up! Lol!! We also had the hummus! It was sooo light, fluffy, and flavorful. The crunchy chickpeas on top were a great touch and added a little more depth to this appetizer! \n\nFor the main course, we had the Joojeh Kabobs, Salmon Kabobs, and the Sabzi Polo! The meats were tender and the Middle Eastern spices were front and center. The Sabzi Polo is a Basmati rice topped with crunchy fried onions. It is definitely large enough to share amongst three or four people! \n\nLastly, for dessert we shared the Baklava. It is paired with best ice cream I've had in a long time! It was rose water, saffron, vanilla ice cream that was super tasty and paired perfectly with the flaky, buttery, nutty, and sweet Baklava. It also goes great with the Turkish coffee!! Yummy!! \n\nNow, of course I can't forget the impeccable service we received! Our server, Michael V., recommended great food options, was super attentive, kept our table cleared, and exuded great energy!! This was our first time visiting this restaurant BUT will definitely not be our last!! I will definitely be back with my friends! \n\nOh! One last thing, parking isn't all that great as it is mostly street parking. Other than that, this place is AMAZING!! Our bill wasn't bad either! About $112 for 2 people! I didn't order alcohol though!",

        "text": "This place was pretty exceptional. The food, flavors, ambiance, service, decor... all great. Came here on a Monday night, getting reservations wasn't easy. We were able to snag a 9:30pm resy which is late for some so it's best to book in advance. \n\nWe ordered the Omani shrimp to start. 10/10. Couldn't ask for more flavorful, perfectly cooked shrimp. The sauce that was on the side was a perfect addition. We ordered the hummus topped with lamb. 10/10. One of the best hummuses I've ever had. A must have when dining here. We ordered the Koobideh Kebab. 9/10. Could be juicier but otherwise great. We also ordered the za'taar fries as a side. 8/10. Good, not great. The spicy tahini it comes with was too spicy and the fries were huge. Next time would probably order one of the rice dishes as a side instead of fries.\n\nThe star of the evening was the desert. We ordered the pistachio lava cake. Everything about this was just perfect. The gooey center, the pistachio pieces, the cardamom gelato. 10/10. Would get again in a heartbeat. \n\nStrongly recommend this restaurant and will revisit next time i visit Atlanta.",

        "text": "I normally don't write for places with so many reviews, however I think a waiter needs a shout out for how impressed I was. Nasr is an amazing server, from his knowledge of the menu, to his kind nature, and upmost professionalism. I go out to eat a lot, and it's been a while since I've had a server that good.\n\nWe came here on a Thursday nite, and it was packed with no availability for a few hours. The GM was determined to get us a seat. He said he had a big party that was coming in 10 min, but if they all didn't show he would get us a table.  We waiting 10 min and he found us a table outside. It was in the mid 40's and we were so comfy! I enjoyed being outside more, bc it wasn't as noisy. Of course the food was incredible. Every bite I took of lamb my eyes rolled. We got the shrimp appetizer, lamb skewers, onion rice, and a condiment. I was more than enough for two people.\nMy only complaint is the wine is just as much as the cocktails. Overall the best service at a restaurant on a crowded night.  Can't wait to come back!",

The menu is a delicious journey through the flavors of his childhood, with mouthwatering Persian dishes that truly hit the spot! If you're looking for an unforgettable culinary adventure, look no further than Delbar!",

        "text": "I brought my parents to Delbar for my dad's 65th birthday dinner (after extensively asking around to my coworkers about where they recommended going) and we LOVED it. We didn't have a reservation so we just went early for dinner and were able to get a table. Honestly the host was so nice, and made us feel really welcome. Our waitress was also incredibly nice and friendly, she made really good recommendations on what to order, explained the menu items and answered all our questions.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a total millennial, the vibes were on point too. The music was a tad loud but it really brought out a fun environment and you could tell people were enjoying themselves. On that note, I thought the cocktails were tasty too!\n\nThe food was really very well made and the menu was diverse with a lot of really great flavors - our waitress did tell us it's different types of middle eastern dishes but I wish the website would have a more fleshed out \"our story\" section or something. Either way, I really love to see this type of food get so much recognition and love from the people of Atlanta (seriously almost all of my coworkers independently recommended it).\n\nOur favorite dish actually was the Muhamara spread, it just had such an amazing flavor profile. The lamb shank was also cooked so perfectly, the meat was actually falling off the bone - they give you a knife but you don't even need it. The sea bass paired really nicely with the pickled veggies too. And the rice dish was a huge serving (actually all the servings for all the dishes were really generous). Then at the end, they brought out some baklava with saffron ice cream that was so amazing I could probably eat it every day of my life.. my mom damn near licked the ice cream bowl (I'm exaggerating but she did really like it).\n\nSeriously, go to Delbar as soon as you get the chance!",

The bill splitting process was different than I've ever seen before. You can access the tab via mobile device and each person is able to select what they got and what they would like to pay for and all payments could be down through the phone. The process was mostly seamless and worked well for my party's size. Overall, I this restaurant was great and I will be returning!",

Bartender (Matt) was attentive and on point with pairing recommendations across small plates, greens & grains, mezze, and wines. The dried lime, citrus, pear, and savory flavors all played off each other. \n\nI enjoyed the following: \n- Shroom & Shishito Hummus (w/o egg, b/c I don't them)\n- Kale Pear Salad \n- Omani Shrimp ( which I ended up slicing and adding to my salad) \n- Sharbat e Zereshk (zero proof drink) \n- Buketo White Wine from Macedonia, Greece\n- Ginger Date Cake - Dessert was  the only thing I hated was the tahini mousse.",

It's good we only have a small party of two, our small count got us a table quicker. \n\nWe started off with a Falafel plate, labneh with squash and figs, hummus, chicken kafta, green zhoug, torshi, spicy tahina, garlic toum. $94.74.\n\nThe labneh is different as a sweet spread. The labneh tastes as if there is cream cheese in it, even though there isn't any in it. It's quite good for labneh. \n\nThe torshi isn't too bad, could be a bit more pickled flavor for me. It's more of a dry pickled veggie. \n\nThe chicken kafta is dry, so is the falafel.\n\nThe appetizers and starters are good here, the entrees aren't as good as the start of our meal though.\n\nThe green ghouj and the spicy tahina are both good. The garlic toum isn't garlicky enough, doesn't have much flavor to it actually.",

Only giving 4 stars because of the service. He also recommended way too much food. We told him we could not take home leftovers as we were going out, and we had about 4 plates leftover. \n\nThe food was great. I started with a dirty martini and these were the best olives I have ever had.  To start we had the dill labneh and Shroom hummus. Both sooo full of flavor and delicious. The fries were interesting, they were thick but the sauce was sooo good. For the main I had the koobideh kabob and the chinjeh beef. The beef and the lamb was on if the best entrees I have had. We got it with rice and it was just the perfect bite. Would dine here again!",

This restaurant does Middle Eastern family style cuisine amazinglyyyy. We went to the Inman Park location which was beautiful, but if you're wanting the flowers everywhere and vibrant decor make sure you go to the Alpharetta location! \n\nFamily style food can be hit or miss, and this spot did not miss!! Your meal begins with complimentary bread and palette cleansers. The table ordered some of their spreads to try: Dill Labneh w/ Lamb, Labneh w/ Lamb, &  Hummus w/ mushrooms & egg. All of them were delicious, my favorite being the hummus!! As a grain we shared the Sabzi Polo, & my individual meat selection was the Koobideh Kabob (lamb & beef). \n\nOverall, the food was stellar and worth the price! Expect to spend a good bit of money here, but just know it's worth it! Such a great conversation ambiance with service to match! Highly, highly, highly recommend",

        "text": "So I was skeptical because I wasn't sure I was a fan of Middle Eastern cuisine. I had been meaning to try the Alpharetta location -- you know the one with the pretty flowers everywhere but this location was nice as well. Inman Park is a great neighborhood in Atlanta.\n\nThis restaurant serves food family style, which I was hesitant about especially with a large group because everyone's taste and budget varies but with the right people I highly, highly, highly suggest this place. Complimentary bread with seasonal pairings is available. We started off with three spreads for a group of nine -- dill labneh w/ lamb, labneh with lamb, and the hummus. My personal favorite was the regular labneh with lamb!\n\nFor our entree I ordered the lamb neck with the sabzi polo and omgggggg. So so so so good. I was skeptical about the cinnamon in the ingredients list but if you're a fan of like coconut curry this taste almost similar. The rice was well seasoned and the broth that the lamb neck was 10/10. I had to take some to go because it was very filling. The rice doesn't look that big in pictures but I think it can comfortably feed no more than 3 people.\n\nService was amazing! Our waiter made sure our cups were filled with water and brought up more bread as need be.\n\nNow that I'm more certain about middle eastern food, I have to go back to the Alpharetta location and try more of the menu.\n\nThe $$$ is true -- my meal with the service charge was $61. Our table of 9 had a total bill of $483 ($50 added for the birthday cake we brought on our own, something to note if you're planning on doing to the same) so on average I'd say expect to spend at least $60 here. Food was worth it in my opinion!\n\nCheck out my food page @helenaonyelp for a more inside scoop!",

Like, you can barely hear yourself think because the acoustics are terrible. Like, you still have to wait 20 minutes for a table despite having a reservation (for 3 people, at that!). WHY? \n\nOh, ok, because the food is phenomenal. It's starting to make sense. I would really only deal with this kind of annoying crowd situation (and the whole scanning the menu on a QR code and paying with the QR code) for amazing food. And it's worth it.\n\nWe had the hummus with lamb (yes, 100% yes, would order every time) that comes with the excellent taftoun bread (my best comparison would be pita bread, but it's not that - just trust that it's good). We also split the heirloom tomato salad. Every restaurant in Atlanta has an heirloom tomato salad right now. This one was so good and fresh and had great crunch cucumbers too.\n\nThen we split these three things as an entree: Adas polo, Chicken Kofta, and Koobideh Kabob. The Adas polo is rice with lentils and raisins, and it is SO large and impressive looking, and pairs very well with kebobs. The koobideh (ground lamb, beef and onion) was our favorite, and I enjoyed the chicken kofta too, but note that it's a little spicy.\n\nOh and how could I forget that my \"heat of the moment\" cocktail was the best spicy margarita I've had in YEARS.\n\nThe three of us were so full, and we had enough leftovers for maybe 3 meals. So for three, we probably could have done just one appetizer or just one kebab. No regrets because the leftovers were so good. I can't wait to come back (maybe on a Monday or something it won't be so hectic? I don't know).",

My waiter made some great recommendations: Adana Bite, Sabzi polo and Joojeh kabob which were great! My waiter also made sure to check on me frequently as I dined alone. They give a huge portion of rice so you'll definitely have leftovers. I wish they gave more meat but all in all you will not be disappointed. \n\nI will definitely make my way back in the future. \n\nTip: park in parking deck down the street and make a reservation in advance",

        "text": "I've never had Persian/Iranian food before coming to Delbar, and I think the restaurant set my standards high for that genre. The service was great and attentive, but our server's voice was quiet, so we couldn't hear half of what he was explaining because the restaurant was very noisy with multiple different conversations going and our close proximity to the kitchen. The place was packed at 9pm, which was pretty late. I was surprised, but I presume that it's because of how popular it is. We made a reservation for 3, and we were seated at a table meant for 6 people. A pleasant surprise.\n\nFood was incredible, even if it was a little pricey. Tons of flavor packed into every dish.\n\nI like how our order is synced through the QR code that is on our table, and we can pay using our phones. It has been a couple of weeks since I visited, but I can still view the details of our bill, which is crazy. I don't know how that works.\n\n5/5 will visit again, maybe at their new location that's opening soon.",

        "text": "My experience at Delbar was amazing from start to finish, and I was so grateful that my friends had introduced me to the place.  From the moment I arrived, I was in awe of the trendy vibe, buzzling atmosphere, and creative menu.  We were lucky to get a table in the pretty courtyard, which was accompanied by very friendly and efficient service.  \n\nThough their cocktail menu was very interesting, I was more intrigued by their zero-proof drink list.  I asked if I could get their Sharbat e Khiyar mix of cucumber, coconut, mint, and citrus with vodka, which they were happy to do.  The drink had a lot of cucumber and coconut flavors, in particular.  It was more like a boozy smoothie and was very refreshing.\n\nIn terms of food, we decided to order a bunch of items and share them.  We started with 2 spreads - the Kashk Bademjoon and the Muhamara.  The first was a creamy blend of fried eggplant, onion, mint, and whey, which was topped with crispy, fried onion strings.  The Muhamara, on the other hand, was a sweet blend of roasted red pepper, walnut, and pomegranate molasses.  I thought they were both excellent, and the portions were more than generous, though I was partial to the pepper spread.  The dips were accompanied by taftoun bread, which was like a crunchy pita, sprinkled with black sesame seeds.  \n\nNext, we ordered a few things from the Greens & Grains section of their menu.  The Beet Carpaccio started with thinly sliced red beets that were elegantly adorned with whipped feta, burnt honey, sour orange, and a pistachio and almond dukkha.  The beets and cheese were particularly fresh and bright; this really was a perfect dish for the warm weather.  The Adas Polo, on the other hand, was a heartier mound of crispy, saffron basmati rice, that was infused with lentils and raisins.  It was satisfyingly sweet and filling.  \n\nLastly, we shared 2 main courses.  The wild-caught, Chilean Seabass came in 3 small fillets that had been seasoned with onion and saffron.  The Lamb Loin had been marinated with yogurt and grilled.  It was infused with notes of citrus, saffron, and garlic.  Both proteins were so fall-apart tender that they melted in our mouths.  They were also examples of simple food done well, in that they had been lightly grilled, but blowed us away with their impact.  \n\nMy experience at Delbar was one of the best meals I had had in a long time.  I was in love and will definitely have the restaurant on my to-do list for my next visit to the area.",

We got the adana bite, muhamra, dill labneh, field pea salad, rice with crispy onion, chicken koftka and stuffed branzino.\n\nI didn't have any of the meat dishes but can say that everything else was very good. My favorite was probably the stuffed branzino, rice and muhamra. The stuffed branzino was so flakey and soft. The rice was perfectly spiced and crispy onions added a lovely texture. The muhamra is a walnut spread that had a slight sweetness. \n\nThey have a complimentary flat bread that you can eat with the spreads you order. If you can cream cheese you'd probably love the labneh. It's shiploads to be yoghurt but honestly is very creamy and slightly tangy like cream cheese. \n\nThe servers were very attentive and the restaurant was packed. I recommend getting a reservation because I had one for 6:30pm but they weren't able to clear a table for us until 7pm for 3 people.",

        "text": "I can't rave about this place enough!! I had been wanting to go to Delbar for so long, so I finally made a reservation for my birthday dinner. My birthday was on a Monday, but even then, it was super crowded so definitely get a reservation! Parkingwise, you can find street parking in Inman Park, park in a paid deck, or go for the complimentary parking in the Mariposa Lofts parking after 6pm. \n\nTo drink, I had the Istanbul Nights which had a really good mezcal. Our waiter also had really good recs and was so friendly and fun! We began with flatbread as well as hummus and dill labneh. We also had a plate of nuts, radishes, and other refreshing herbs to cleanse our palate between courses. The spreads were SO GOOD. The hummus was creamy and the labneh was absolutely tangy and divine. We also tried the Zaa'tar fries which were so yummy!!\n\nFor the main course, we ordered some dishes family-style (and I definitely recommend this so you can try a lot)! For our table of 8, we got two rices (they are large portions), the sabzi polo and adas polo. For meats, we got the chicken kofta, 2 lamb necks, koobideh kabob (lamb and beef), and joojeh kabob (chicken). The rice was great, I loved the sabzi which was the savory rice, but the adas was sweeter and also delicious. The meats were all super tender but the lamb neck was my personal favorite. The meat was literally falling off the bone and the stew it came in was delicious!! There was plenty to go around and we definitely still had leftovers. \n\nAt the end, our waiter was so sweet and brought out a portion of baklava and rose-flavored ice cream. The baklava was so delicious and just a great way to cap the night. Overall, I had an absolutely amazing dinner and can't wait to return to Delbar to try the brunch!!",

        "text": "Amazing date night experienced at Delbar Inman Park location! This restaurant came highly recommended by several friend groups so we decided to try it out and it truly did not disappoint. Everything, and I do mean everything, was extremely flavorful. From the starters, to the grains, the spreads, the entrees and cocktails- there is something on the menu for everyone!! My husband is a picky eater and even he found everything to be tasty!\n\nMake a reservation !! Parking is a bit tough especially on the weekend! We arrived an hour earlier than our reservation time (oops!) and the staff graciously got us seated right away! Our server, Q, was amazing ! He walked us through the entire menu and made great recommendations. \n\nThe shrimp, wings, dill labneh, the bread, sheesh everything !! The sea bass deserves a review on her own, but due to time I'll just say- order it!!!!!\n\nWe will be back soon to experience their brunch menu!",

        "text": "Did celebrate my birthday last week at Delbar (Inman park location) \nThe ambiance , vibe, service was pretty great. \nNo complains there. \n\nEverything we ordered tasted pretty fresh and great. \nSpecial mention to  the feta cheese they serve so light, fresh and tasty. If you love cheese you would love it. I Ordered it twice lol. \nAlso did order the rice it had fried onion in it, did not get the picture of it but it tasted pretty good. \nOnly thing I did not like was the wings, a lot of them raved about it, but surprisingly it was really charred, and tasted really sweet. No one at our table liked those may be it's our taste buds . We sent it back and did not get charged for it. \nOverall a good experience but I do like the Alpharetta location better but when you compare the timing for weekdays this location works!",

If you like lamb you'll Love the lamb ribs. I've had this dish before at several Mediterranean or Middle Eastern restaurants and this one is the best.  The kale and pear salad is great! Hummus amazing! Crispy rice with lentils and raisins was a delicious surprise! I also Loved the Shrimp appetizer. We were served by several servers who were super attentive!",
