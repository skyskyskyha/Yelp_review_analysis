        "text": "I had the most incredible brunch experience at Botica yesterday around 3pm! As someone who loves going out to eat, I appreciate a great experience. \n\nFirst off, the environment is very full of life, there is a huge round bar in the middle of the restaurant, a nice sunny patio area, and there's a pop of color everywhere you look! The music is fun and not too loud. There's a lot of Hispanic inspired decor and I love it! \n\nAs far as food, my partner and I decided to try the chicken and waffles, steak and eggs and a mango mimosa. The mimosa was very delicious, it is such a good reliable drink. The steak and eggs were cooked to perfection, I ordered my steak medium and my eggs scrambled, the potatoes were also a hit. The chicken and waffles were good as well! I love the way it was set up on the plate with pineapple and nice organization. \n\nAs far as service, our server Merma was very attentive. We went during brunch time so we were worried it would be a bit too busy, but she did amazing and made sure we had everything we needed. She was excellent I definitely recommend asking for her. Mina was also great and he checked on us as well with a friendly smile and conversation. The service alone was enough to convince us to want to come back soon! Great food, service and environment, it was all amazing!",

        "text": "Botica replaced Watershed (one of my old faves UGH) but I was still excited to see what Botica was all about. We made reservations at Botica for my bestie's birthday dinner and even though it was a Tuesday night, the parking deck was POPPING like I don't know why there were so many people out and about. We witnessed a fender bender in the super tight parking deck. Luckily we weren't a part of that mess and headed toward the restaurant entrance. Parking is validated once you park in the attached deck when you enter your license on the iPad at the hostess stand.\n\nIt's a big ole party when you arrive - even on a Tuesday night. Back in 2022, the crispy fish tacos were $2 each so of course we ordered one per person, along with tasty tapas and apps, including the patatas bravas, the wagu carpaccio, the Spanish grilled octopus and the tuna crudo. My absolute FAVORITE bite was the crispy Diablo wings - super spicy but tasted great. \n\nAnd you know it's not a birthday without green tea shots - only $10 a piece phew. Definitely recommend Botica to celebrate or even to grab just a casual bite to eat!",

        "text": "Went for happy hour as a first timer and this place is pretty good. They offer free 3hr parking, and a decent HH. For me, the eggplant empanadas were bomb. They only give you one cut in half but I had at least 2 or 3 of them. \n\nJordan the bartender was A1 and made the best drinks that night. Nice and strong. All HH items are $5 but be careful, it can add up quickly. \n\nI wasn't impressed with their quesadillas, unfortunately. For starters, the beans are inside of the quesadilla, not on the side with the rice. BLASPHEMY! Also, as you can see in the picture, not much holding it together. I chose salmon for my protein and for what I paid, it was definitely underwhelming. \n\nOverall, staff was nice, HH was good and there's free 3 hr parking w/validation.",

        "text": "Meh. Came in at opening. No host at the front but he walked over shortly after and was friendly. Service was good. It indeed slow. I got the steak and egg brunch option and a pork belly taco. Both were good but neither were exceptional. So why the 3 stars? The prices. Steak and eggs plus the taco came out to $50, I get it steak is expensive but if it's going to be that expensive at least make it stand out from the rest.  I was seated in the back and service took a while to get to me but they have a lot of tvs to keep you entertained. The taco was decent enough to get again but at the prices I'd be hesitant to go back for the mediocrity. I will also say that the portion for the steak was pretty large but eggs and potato aren't expensive ‍ maybe they just need to work on the portion size to adjust pricing appropriately but yeah.",

It's is so yummy. Flash grilled Ahi Tuna w Fresh Jalepeno Slice on top, with a Truffle Oil Crème and Served w Guacamole in the Center w Plantain Chips!!! So freakin good. I usually get some shots since they have a really extensive tequila menu and a Blood Orange Margarita. Then second fave is the Salmon entree, it's Salmon w chimichurri and spinach and grilled corn and arugula! Again this is a must for me every time. I usually get a asada taco on the side! lol yea I'm greedy. And I close w a creme brûlée topped w blackberries. This is a great girl date spot or just real date spot. I'll be back soon. They actually make 3 different types of house hot sauces so ask for some. 10/10 definitely recommend",

We were seated right away and the bar was filled crowded with people watching college football so it was VERY LOUD. It didn't bother us though so it was fine and quite entertaining when the team won. Our waiter was attentive and I started off with a Mexican mule and that took me a little bit to finish. I believe my friend ordered the Botica and I don't think he enjoyed it as much. I asked if they knew how to make a French 75 and they did. I ordered that for my second drink and that absolutely did the job. It was pretty tasty and they surely filled that drink to the brim! It's average price for drinks so seems pretty normal, but I thought it was a cool chill spot. I would go back and see what the food is like as well.",

        "text": "I've been to Botica one other time and the experience was mid but this time was a lot better! Ordered the salmon quesadilla as my entree and it's was actually very good! I feel like salmon is a hard clncept for restaurants to master cause it's either not seasoned enough or overly seasoned but this was a great balance. It was a bit oily like noticeably oily but if you give your diet a break for the day you can ignore it \n\nThe Mexican rice and the black beans were very nice as well! Not your typical yellow rice but the rice was seasoned with a little bit of spiciness to it. I was a fan!\n\nHighly suggest ordering the coconut mojito as a drink. Some other people at the table had the pineapple and said they weren't a fan but I loved the coconut mojito. The table had great remarks about aperol spritz froze as well!\n\nPricing was a bit pricier than expected for a Mexican restaurant -- 20% gratuity is added to all checks and there is a liquor tax so it does add up. My bill with just an entree and a drink was $47 so with appetizers and things like that it'll take up. Now is the food worth the price -- maybe if you really love Mexican food ‍ \n\nThey do a great job of celebrating birthdays tho!",

I even came for the first time earlier this week for their happy hour for a work event. Both times have been great. The location is amazing right across the street from the hive. The parking is very convenient with an attached parking deck where you can validate your parking when you walk into the restaurant. We were sat very quickly and the food was brought out even quicker. The TVs outside were all playing Sunday afternoon football which was great no matter what team you're going for. We ordered the chicken nachos, Que padre, chicken and waffles, and an omelette. Everything was a 10 out of 10! I would definitely be returning for another happy hour or even for when the game is on.",

I got the Chicken Enchiladas with Verde and while the enchiladas were good, I was very disappointed by the rice. It looked like it would've been flavorful, but it was bland and even slightly weird tasting. Further, I feel like the meal should've come with both rice and beans.

I went on a Wednesday so of course I had to try their paella (note: you can only order the paella on Wednesday after 3pm, and it is $30), and it was one of the best I've ever had, which was surprising since I've had plenty homemade ones! There were mussels, shrimp, clam, other delicious seafood, and even little bites of well-seasoned chicken! \n\nAlso, since it is Women's History Month our server gave my friend and I complimentary champagne and shots. And it goes without saying that everyone from the host to the servers were as kind and attentive as ever. This has easily become one of my favorite restaurants I have been to.",

They validate parking!! Amazing 2. They have so many cool spots indoors but also a great patio that can be covered if it rains which it did and they have heaters as well as tvs to watch sports games! \n\nWeird unwarranted Recommendation: It would be so epic if yall  hosted bachelor viewing parties mondays so everyone in atl could watch the tragedy together lol it would get a lot of people in lol",

The ambience is chic and lovely, I like the outdoor patio. Service was ok even though the place wasn't packed, we had to ask for water, I feel like that should be standard.

I enjoyed the queso, salsa and guacamole (and I'm picky about my guac). All of our food came out perfectly with no mistakes, the brought out bday shots to celebrate, and bread pudding with a candle. \nEveryone truly enjoyed their food (I got the omelette and it was yummy).

        "text": "How on earth does this place have 4 stars?? This is a two star place and thats being a bit too nice. \n\nSpanish and Mexican is not a usual fusion and there's a huge reason. \n\nOk so let's start with ambiance. Logo and first look at the place, it has a Mexican restaurant vibe and that's why we chose it. I'm all about my hispanic vibes all day everyday and even happier when some reggaeton is playing. \n \nThe style of the restaurant from seating to drapes doesn't match at all. Extremely awkward and then you have huge tv's in your face. \n\nI look at the menu to find out they have \"Spanish\" food. I ordered the gambas alajillo, a meat taco, and churros. \n\nThe gambas were ridiculously disgusting, not fresh and not deveined. The shrimp came with the head on and I thought I would need to rip them off but no, those were just decorative. They were old re used shrimp heads that were severely discolored that's just how old they were. How deplorable!! The sauce it came in was pretty good but not traditional and I didn't taste much if garlic there. Then they had these two slices of bread pre dipped inside for you all sogged up. Zero class. There was NOTHING Spanish about this and I am insulted. Take the word Spanish out of this place because this is NOT they way we do it. \n\nThe taco was just ok/edible and nothing I would ever come back for. \n\nThe \"churros\", I thought for sure this part would be the saving grace. I couldn't believe it, NOT churros. It's fried dough shaped to appear like them but no way. And the chocolate, nasty. \n\nBeen in ATL for years and this is the worst restaurant I've ever been too. Worse than the one with the roaches crawling everywhere that got more stars since the food was delicious. Guess I'm pretty over worked about this but don't put certain cultures of food on the menu when you don't know how to cook it!!",

        "text": "This is such a cute and colorful place; walking in instantly puts you in an upbeat mood. I went on a Saturday afternoon and the server gave us both a brunch menu and a regular menu. Everything sounded so good so it took some time to choose and some of us ordered multiple dishes so we could share. For drinks, I started with a CoCo. This is such a refreshing drink thanks to the cucumber/coconut combination. It's reminiscent of a day on the beach. With that side, it's a little light on the alcohol. It takes more like a really refreshing mocktail. Still a good drink but I ended up switching to a Jack and Ginger Beer. Now, for food:\n\nHalibut Ceviche: This may be one of the best ceviches I've ever had. The halibut tastes fresh, it had great texture (firm but not dry) and I lived the amount of acidity this ceviche had. It may be too much for some but if you like a lot of acid, you'll love this.\n\nLamb Birria taco: The flavor wasn't bad but the tortilla was soggy and started to fall apart before I could even pick it up. Also, it could use another scoop or two of lamb. It's not much meat on the taco. Also, I thought birria tacos were supposed to be dunked. This was my first time but I think I've always seen them dunked. I only received a tiny shot of jus with this taco. \n\nChicken shawarma: Sooo good! It reminded me of the chicken shawarma wraps I used to get from a place back home. Really great flavor and the chicken was pretty juicy. The freshness of the tomatoes really helps to balance out the richness of the tahini.",

We were seated in the heated/covered patio which was nice on a cool rainy night. The music wasn't too loud and the vibe was cool. \n\nFor the drinks: We had a pineapple mojito (I was never a fan of mojitos but would drink this), frozen pineapple margarita (amazing), and a Casamigo margarita with a splash of ginger beer (nice and strong how I like it). \n \nFor the food: There were lots of tacos had (chicken shawarma, lamb birria, carne asada, grilled shrimp) and a chicken quesadilla. There were no complaints at all. \n\nI would most definitely return and ask for ChiChi!",

This definitely was unfortunate as a 20% gratuity is automatically included. The food looked and smelled good but was quite bland to look so seasoned.

They were giving out green beads haha and the DJ was popping off. \n\nThey validate parking in the garage for the building! \n\nService was aloof but kind. We had to flag our server for multiple things but overall he handled our request (more to come) nicely. I understand it was a super busy night too.\n\nWe got the nachos appetizer with steak and it hit the spot!! It was thick/shareable and while on the colder side was heavy with ingredients. \n\nFor the entree we split the seafood paella (which isn't on the menu but when we asked our server about it he mentioned it was an available special). The pictures looked amazing but honestly the taste was a bust :'( the moment we got the dish it was super fishy and didn't smell fresh. There's around 2 pieces of each seafood option too which was disappointing. We told our server about it and how we just couldn't finish, which he was kind enough to comp without question (appreciate it!!). \n\nAll in all probably more fun when you're getting tipsy haha - the food was hit or miss, but the location is a bop.",

        "text": "$270 for brunch and honestly nothing was extremely tasty or memorable.\n\nThey're earing three stars because our waitress Tati was friendly, sociable and made us feel welcomed from beginning to end. Also its a peak location for watching cars drive down Peachtree Street if you're into that kinda thing. \n\nWe went with the mimosa flight ($48).  It was served with a carafe of orange juice and a miniature carafe of mango nectar.  Not to be confused with bottomless mimosa, once your bottle if empty its another $48 if you want more.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the grilled oysters ($17) and wagu albondigas, which is basically two meatballs ($16).  The oysters were tiny and flavorless.  You couldn't even tell there were oysters on the shell they were so tiny. The meatballs were undercooked and pink on the inside so we pushed those to the side and forgot all about them. Someone came by and cleared our plates so quietly, they were taken off the table before I had a chance to let someone know they were undercooked and able to ask to have them removed from the check.   I did enjoy the marinara sauce and toasted sourdough bread that comes with it.\n\nNext up we tried the shrimp taco and crispy fish taco ($5.50 each).  These were by far the best part of the entire meal. Flavorful and the pepper that accompanied the fish taco was a nice spicy surprise. If I was to return it would be for the tacos. I was very pleased with the amount of shrimp and fish on the tacos.  \n\nThe brunch menu just was not appealing so three of us ordered the Steak and Eggs. Weirdly we were charged $24 for one and $25 for the other two.  the eggs were cooked to order and we all commented that the steak was tender but it was the chimichurri sauce on top that complimented the meat the best.  The potatoes were dry and tasteless. Not even dipping them in the hollandaise sauce made them either better. \n\nOne person went with the Rack of Lamb ($36) three tiny lamb chops also with the flavorless potatoes. \n\nWhen I visited their website, I saw it stated that a 20% service charge is added to all parties of six or more, so it was a disappointment to receive the check and see the 20% service charge added to our party of four.  I mentioned this to our waitress and she explained that the 20% is added to ALL CHECKS, regardless of party size.  She also showed me the menu where it states that 20% is added to all check. \n\nIf you want a nice patio experience on Peachtree Street, consider this place, but I don't recommend anything other than the shrimp or fish tacos.  \n\nThey offer to validate your parking, so give the hostess your tag number when you enter. I didn't really understand how this worked since there is ni ticket pulled when you enter the garage nor a gate when you exit, but as long as my car isn't booted or towed, it doesn't matter how it gets done, just happy not to have to pay for parking on top of the $270 tab of which $41.50 was a force gratuity",

        "text": "Parking is in the garage, and validated at the iPad in the front of the restaurant, which requires your tag number. It's a large restaurant, with a sizable bar and ample seating. I was with a large group when I went, and we were all seated with no issues, and when the checks came at the end, it was smooth sailing and no issues with anyone's bills. \n\nA few negatives that stuck out: \n\nThe server brought out drinks and placed them in front of people and we all had no idea what drink it was and who ordered it. It became a little annoying after a while because I ordered a mineral water, but kept getting cocktails placed in front of me. \n\nIn terms of food, it was really, really, really mediocre for the price of the dishes. Also the serving was a LOT smaller than I expected. The overall ambience is very loud, almost like a dive bar late in the night kind of energy. People dancing, having fun, open air patio seating, and the DJ (yes there's a DJ) keeping things lively. But the food was so mediocre, and for someone who went there for dinner, that was a big turn off. I personally don't think I'd go again. But if you're into a place that has lots of drinks, a bar, a lot of energy, and don't mind the party atmosphere, give it a shot! Just don't expect anything spectacular in terms of food or portions.",

This is on a side of town where the hospital is and not a lot of restaurants so I'm surprised it was here to be honest but love that it's next to a breakfast joint and hello! They have a patio. We had some nachos, tacos and a flight of mimosas... wish I would've taken photos because it was amazing!! And our server was LITERALLY the sweetest. We were there for prolly 3 hours! And had the best service. \n\nI also loved the food. And I'm Latina so I am hella picky- salsa were on point. And they validate your parking in the parking deck, don't forget it!",

Our table shared the Ceviche and an order of Nachos with chicken and WOW. The ceviche was nice and limey and did not have a fishy taste. The nachos were really well flavored and perfect to share. For my main course I got a grilled shrimp taco and carne asada taco with a side of jalapeño corn & 10/10, they were all good! And to top it off, the table got bread pudding and the churros for dessert. I would definitely say get the Bread Pudding!!! The churros were alright but they fell a tad dry but honestly, the rest of the meal was so delicious that it didn't bother me. The service was good, nothing above and beyond but we were checked on regularly so that's all I can really ask for",

You also pay $5 just for 1 taco. \nMac & cheese: it wasn't too cheesy but that's ok because sometimes too much cheese can be very overwhelming. \nRose: not too sweet not to tart. \nWaitress: very polite and attentive. \n\nOverall, although the price was high I appreciated the quality of this place.

There is a deck and you walk right in and put your license plate in at the register and parking is free. Our server MiMi was very informative and professional yet friendly. The fish was as light and flavorful as promised. We also tried several dishes from the happy hour menu all were fantastic especially the head on grilled shrimp swimming in garlic butter which included large chunks of garlic. The wagu meatball was flavorful and so was the hummus plate. The place is large with big screen TVs all over and after 7 it's quite lively. I can't wait to return.",

Restaurant with nice vibes and a big bar.\n\nDrinks: had the house margs: strong, delicious, $10\n\nFood: started with the chips and queso which our server happily refilled. A little bit on the more expensive side for appetizers. For dinner, I got the lamb birria and fried fish tacos. The lamb birria was too saucy unfortunately - couldn't get a distinct lamb taste. The fried fish taco was one of the best I've had in a long time.\n\nService: no complaints about the servers but do note that the restaurant adds an automatic 20% tip to all tabs \n\nParking: parking garage in the same building, they validate parking up to 3 hours which was great!",

You can register yourself once you arrive inside the restaurant. It's vibrantly decorated and pretty. I ordered the steak chilaquiles with both sauces. We also had mimosas. I was satisfied with both. There were a few things I didn't care for. The Nespresso martini was the special cocktail. The coffee flavor was overpowering at the end of the drink, we couldn't finish it. The server was helpful when we arrived and made sure to get our order placed and delivered but drifted off. They didn't come to check on us for 45 minutes. I eventually flagged them down for the check which needed to be corrected due to incorrect pricing but was fixed without issue. I was not happy with the 20% auto gratuity for a party of 3. I would suggest going before football starts. The bar area was very sports bar-esque, we even got stopped by an intoxicated patron trying to buy us drinks on our way out.",
