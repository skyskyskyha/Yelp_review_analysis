Partly because Darnell, our server was beyond amazing! \n\nHe was extremely attentive, offered amazing suggestions and his personality was a delight to our experience.\n\nFood was great! I had the Branzino and Creamed Spinach.. my friends and I shared the Brussels and Augratin Potatoes while they each had the Lobster Duo and Sirloin.\n\nAll of the food was perfectly cooked- the Brussels were my favorite side as they lended a slnatrual sweetness I'd never experienced - \n\nThe desserts were chocolate cake and crème brûlée- the crème brûlée was perfectly prepared.\n\nOur drinks were a hit also- I'll def be returning for a 4th visit! \n\nDef ask for Darnell when you go! \n\n\nThank you again Darnell for making my 3rd visit the absolute best visit ever.\n\nCongratulations again on your graduation! Best of luck!",

        "text": "I had the pleasure of dining at Little Alley this evening to celebrate a special occasion. \n\nThe food and wine were delicious; however, what made the experience extra special is the exceptional service provided by our server, Jasmine. She was kind, professional, made excellent recommendations (food and wine), and took the time to throughly explain the menu. I dine out often, and the service that I received today it really stood out for me. Going forward, I will make a point to always request her section. \n\nAs for the food, we had the fried lobster and cognac shrimp appetizers - both were delicious, I'd order them again. And now for the star of the show, the steak. We decided to go with the dry-aged ribeye (medium), topped with the bone marrow butter. The steak was flavorful and tender.  (In case it matters, my current favorite steakhouse is Bavette's in Chicago.) We ordered the mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach for our sides. They were pretty good and shareable for 2 - 3 people. \n\nAll in all, the exceptional service and delicious food made for a great experience. I'll definitely be back. Next time I hope to grab a few drinks at the outside bar since it seems like it had a really nice vibe.",

We started with lobster bisque and I opted for additional lobster. Had I not I probably wouldn't have eaten any of it. It had no flavor whatsoever. The muscles on the other hand were amazing! We split the branzino, lobster Mac n cheese and creamed spinach. We were disappointed that they all came out cold. The lobster Mac n cheese didn't have a lot of cheese or flavor. The branzino and creamed spinach were very flavorful and a must have. I got the remedy and my daughter got the Cuban. They were ok. The restaurant itself was really nice but our waiter wasn't very attentive. We waited for 15 minutes to put in our dessert order after our table was cleared. The cheesecake of day was delicious! Apple with bourbon Carmel sauce.  Both the inside and outside bars were really nice.",

The prime NY strip was a little tough (med-rare) and cooked unevenly. The patio is gorgeous and it was a very nice setting.

        "text": "So to be a top rated steak house in the state and in the country they have a lot to live up to. For me on our trip they didn't do it and I wouldn't go back for what we got. Our bill for 4 was almost 800$ and I can't say it was amazing. We started with drinks overall decent but the individual spriita were pricey. 40$ for my komos rose tequila. Ok for an Atl price. And yummy lots of choices for a steakhouse too. For apps we had crispy lobster- good and hot fried perfectly. Kobe meatballs delish and loved the sauce. Bone marrow -overcooked burnt and really not enough. Also had off menu shrimp with cognac sauce. We didn't like just plain. Wedge salad solid and bacon good.  Steak wise we had a bone in filet, and 2 ribeyes. The filet was way undercooked and then over seared in some places. The ribeyes looked good but needed butters for flavor. The sides were had creamed corn -tasty , the augratin came out cold and we sent back to be heated. The twice baked was good, the Brussels not cooked enough too hard and the fries were yummy and just enough salt. Dessert had the bacon bar and chocolate cake. Cake no good. Bacon bar yummy but very rich one bar would be enough. And needs more sauce. The server Joshua was knowledgeable and very nice and attentive. Not what I expected but maybe it was an off day.",

        "text": "Googled most romantic restaurants in Atlanta and this place came up. Asked around and read reviews and decided to give it a try. Made reservations online because I prefer that convenience. \n\nThis place is nestled in Buckhead in the Lenox Park area.  Easy to get to with plenty of parking options including garage and valet. There are a few seating options. There's a smaller bar building outside if you prefer a more bar/lounge type experience with outside seating and indoor seating. I thought this was a pretty modern idea. Upon entry into the restaurant. The ambience and decor are amazingly breathtaking. \n\nThere was definitely social distancing. There wasn't anyone seated at tables right next to each other which I appreciated. For ladies wearing heels, the floors are somewhat slippery so heads-up on that. I had to hold my dates hand so I wouldn't take a tumble. Lol \n\nWe were seated immediately and had the most amazing server. She was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and offered suggestions on what to try. Very engaging and professional. I had the dry aged NY strip with creamed corn, truffle Mac n cheese and Brussel sprouts. Hands down ... flavorful and delicious.   I will most definitely return.",

        "text": "Went back for Easter and service by Jason was amazing! Best service I've had in a while. Food was also great everyone liked their meals. My husband and I ordered our steaks Medium and Medium well and the Medium well came out Well done and the Medium came out Medium Well. When the manager (with the glasses) came over he was rude and said the medium steak looks medium to him. Well it wasn't and he didn't have to be rude about it. He wasn't the one consuming it, I was! If it's not to the customers liking you ask how the customer how would like the steak prepared and so forth. Not go back and forth justifying what you think is right. I was disappointed in his service and it gave off unprofessional subpar steakhouse management similar to a chain such as outback or Applebees. We know that when we patronize a 4/5 star steakhouse, when the steak is presented to the table, we will be asked to check the steak before they walk away from the table and they did not do that here. Very disappointed in management and quality. My moms steak was ordered medium well and it came out medium but she did not send it back. When I asked the manager to explain their temps he said medium is warm thin pink line, medium well is dull pink line, well done is no pink and medium rare is red. So plan accordingly folks when ordering anything other than well done here! \n\nI also noticed when we were walking out another person who seemed like also a manager tried to tell us bye thanks for coming etc and before he could get it out the manager with the glasses nudged him to pull him mid words to talk to him which was awkward and again unprofessional.",

We were given time to make decisions, recommendations, our glasses were always full and plates were never left empty for more than a few moments. They had tons of options for our toddler who would have licked the grilled mushrooms plate if we let him. The seafood tower was incredible, and the shrimp appetizer was full of flavor. They make a perfect gin martini (not too much vermouth). I recommend the seafood overall, but the guys got ribeyes which were cooked to perfection (medium rare). \n\nWe can't wait to visit again.",

Started with a shrimp appetizer that is not on the menu! It was really good and enough for 2 people. Ordered the ribeye (medium well), lobster Mac & cheese, Brussel sprouts & broccoli. The ribeye was juicy, meaty with a little fat. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly! Can't go wrong with the ribeye! The lobster Mac & cheese was also really good! The lobster is loaded on top of the Mac & cheese. Sooo good!! I'm not a brussel sprouts person, however these were so good! Probably could've skipped the broccoli as we had so much food!!!  Definitely going back for a date night!",

        "text": "My husband and I visited Little Alley on Friday for a pre-New Year's Day dinner date. I made reservations awhile ago on Open Table and when we arrived we were seated right away. I will say the door to the restaurant is a little hidden and a couple of guests, including us, found ourselves trying to figure out how to get in. Nonetheless, we were able to figure it out and it didn't take too long to do so. The restaurant is absolutely breathtaking. It's very picturesque. Once seated, we were greeted by Callie and Nina. Nina assisted Callie. They were both very knowledgeable about the menu and answered all of our questions. They brought us out complimentary bread to start the night off. The bread was okay, but not the best ever. The butter was the best part in our opinion. We started our order off with cocktails and an appetizer. For cocktails, we ordered the Little Alley 77 and an Old-Fashioned. Both drinks were good. The Old-Fashioned was strong, which was good but I thought the Little Alley 77 could have offered more, especially for the price. For appetizers, we ordered the Moroccan-style shrimp. We weren't crazy about this appetizer. The saffron flatbread seemed misplaced and didn't belong. It was soggy and didn't add anything to the dish. The shrimp had a good flavor, but we'd order something different in the future. For entrees, we both ordered a wet-aged center cut filet, along with some enticing steak enhancements (fried lobster and cognac shrimp). In addition, I ordered the mushroom, shallots, and brandy sauce for my steak and we ordered two sides to share: the lobster Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts. This is where we began to really enjoy our dining experience. The meal came alive. Everything was absolutely delicious. We loved the table side service we received when our steak was presented to us. The fried lobster was chef's kiss. Both steaks were cooked to perfection. The Brussels sprouts with the yuzu Béarnaise sauce was fantastic and the lobster Mac and cheese was loaded with lobster. We thoroughly enjoyed this portion of our dinner. To end the night, we had the warm milk chocolate cake. Absolutely mouthwatering! Overall, great experience and great service provided by Callie and Nina. We will definitely be back in the future.",

I ordered the shrimp appetizer and a Caesar salad both in my opinion should be the easiest thing to cook but it was awful my shrimp were under cooked and the bread was very soggy due to the sauce being drenched on it, the Caesar salad was very tasteless. The lobster Mac & cheese was the best thing I experienced there. A friend of mine had a tomahawk steak and he loveeeed it, he also ordered oysters and stated he had better so I guess they were just ok and another friend had the fried lobster tails which looked good he said it was ok so I guess this is the type of steakhouse where you don't order seafood...?

        "text": "Before y'all yell at me for this rating, I would like to say I am a steakhouse hater at my core- it's too overpriced for the food they give. I had heard only 5 star reviews for little alley so I wanted to try.\n\nOk so there were a lot of pros:\n- the sides were fantastic: sweet potato was a personal favorite of mine, it was like a dessert \n- soup and salad were also excellent \n- service 10/10 \n- location, valet 10/10 \n\nCons:\n- I ordered the tomahawk medium rare & you can see in this picture it is much more leaning to rare. I asked the waiter about it and he tried to explain how it was medium rare and not rare but I've had a lot of steak in my life, and I'm still not convinced it was medium rare. He was explaining how if we got it cooked more it wouldn't be as tough to chew. But medium rare has always been the recommendation for the tomahawk. It was charred on the outside and I had to spit a piece out because it was taking so long to chew. $139 steak and we couldn't even eat it. My dad took it home for the dog and threw out the rest LOL. While I understand I'm probably in the minority for this, i don't exactly have another $139 to waste on another undercooked steak. When spending $500 on a dinner at a STEAKhouse, meat temp is an important thing to look out for before sending out food. \n\nI'm coming back don't get me wrong. This is the better of the Atlanta steakhouses for sure. I'll be getting the cowboy ribeye next time though to see if it's cooked better",

        "text": "This is my final review for Daniel B's wedding extravaganza weekend.  Everything is kind of out of order, but hey, so is my brain so its all good.  Daniel was kind enough to treat all of his grooms people to a lunch before the wedding at Little Alley Steak in Buckhead.  I had never been, and I had seen (and heard) a lot of things about this place.  We ate @ Mission + Market the night before, which was a few buildings down, so I figured it should be easy to find.\n\nIt was only a milish to get there, so I figured 15 minutes would be plenty of time to get there.  WRONG.  1 right turn and 2 lefts took 16 minutes on a early Friday afternoon.  Asinine.  Of course, the valet line was like 10 deep again, I decided to park in the first garage again, since it seemed to make the most sense in terms of location (wrong, I guess that one isn't the one that validates, hogwash).\n\nI walk up and see this sign that says something about politely asking to wear nice clothes.  How pretentious.  Why don't you just say well pick and choose who can come in.  Besides, don't you think its a little to late when you walk up and they say you are underdressed?  I mean, its not like I would bring extra clothes just in case.  Anywho, after going in, it didn't look like anything too special , except the high prices.  I say fuck what you wear, if you can afford it thats what matters.  I didn't see anything too exclusive here, but what would I know.  Long story short, at least the best man wore a Braves tee and he wasn't turned away.\n\nI got seated at the grand table at like 12:02 and it seemed like they were all ready to order.  I mean, damn!  My bad.  You can clearly tell Buckhead is not my home turf.  I scanned the menu (I talked with Jang the day before about what we were gonna get, so we had a little idea what to order).  But it seemed like I literally had a minute to scan the menu.  The waiter (which seemed kind of stuffy to some people, nicer to the others, that was odd) talked about the beef and how they were one of the only places in country with that kind of beef and yadda yadda, so I decdied to see what his sham was all about.  I ordered a prime strip oscar style.  Then he said that they didn't have the king crab but just regular crab (we the hell that means) and went on a spiel how they don't sell the crab from Russia/Ukraine.  I thought that was odd, because I thought the top king crab came from Alaska.  Sooo, the cheaper kind was \"only\" 27.95 instead of like $37ish.  I should have just skipped that altogether.  I also ordered a salad, and some twice baked potatoes.\n\nWe were so excited to hit Daniel in his deep pockets for this lunch- making us miss work and buy tuxes and everything else 4 years in the making (at the time of the original wedding, I was living in Denver, so that would have been a plane ticket too).  I then saw that nobody else was drinking, so I felt like a huge asshole when I ordered a Maker's old fashioned (joke was on the photographer when she said no drinking).  But oh well, it was early and I was hungover.\n\nThe salad came out, and that was probably my favorite thing.  It was funny though, the groomswoman had to leave early to get her hair make up done (and they knew that) and I still got my salad before her (awkward, I had no idea she got it or I would have given her mine).  The steak came and so did the monster potatoes (jesus, now I know why they were $11, you can share them between 3/4 people).\n\nThe steak was cooked perfectly to temp, but the flavor lacked and it tasted refrozen.  The crab meat was so small I should have used a boba straw to slurp it up.  I think Jang and I were the only jerks who got steaks, everyone else got smaller stuff (oops).  But you know what, I ate like a king, but I didn't waste any.  The thing that pissed me off the most?  They didn't even offer dessert, WTF?!?!?  I mean with all the time we stood around with our thumbs up our asses in the afternoon, I had PLENTY of time for more drinks and at least one dessert.  Lunch was on Daniel, right?  I should have given him my unvalidated $12 parking ticket too, LOL.\n\nIt was a kind gesture indeed and a great time for sure, at least talking to the rest of the grooms party.  But it was awkward staring at Daniel, since we were forbidden to talk to him.  Thanks again for the experience, Yelp King!",

        "text": "Restaurant entrance is beautiful. They have indoor and outdoor dining.  We preferred the indoor to keep ourselves cool from the humidity outside. We were a group of 6.\nSHY was our server. Very bubbly personality and catered to all our requests. \nWe ordered the seafood platter, steak,  pasta....omg everything was too good including the wine. \nOnly disappointment was they never gave us the crab cutter to start with.  So we struggling with our hands until we requested one from the floor manager. \nBy the time it came we were just too bummed to go through the process of cutting.  Felt like we were at juicy crab...all messy.",
