        "text": "Pulled up for dinner shortly after 7 on a Friday. We didn't have a reservation but was quickly seated outside.  The patio area wasn't packed or booked up as I had assumed it'd be (coming from DC, reservations for any outdoor dining is practically a must).  \n\nOur waiter was Chris. He was pleasant and helpful.\n\nWhenever I see a tapas menu, I'm ready to order half if not most of the menu items.  So imagine my excitement.\n\nWe decided on the roasted carrots, brussels, grilled octopus, skirt steak, and the scallops.  \n\nThe roasted carrots were served cold to our surprise but was absolutely tasty.  I only took a bite or two since I had my eyes on other plates.\n\nThe Brussels were crispy and not overly doused in sauce, my fav.  But they were undercooked, way more firm than Id like.\n\nThe grilled octopus was quite amazing.  Nice and thick, we could taste the grilled, smoky flavors.  The roaster potatoes were cooked just right, soft at the center with crispy edges. Highly recommend.\n\nThe skirt steak was absolutely one of the top 2 plates that came out.  Each bite was tinder and juicy, with the perfect seasoning.  Also, highly recommend.\n\nThe scallops were a 9/10.  I loved them more once I got pass the tomato jam.  The tomato jam overpowers the dish initially and I wasn't a fan of that. Every other component tho? Especially the mash, was a perfect compliment.\n\nTo drink, I had 50 shades of purple.  It was fruity but light and perfect for a summer day.  The gin wasn't so forward either which I liked, sometime gin can smack you in the mouth.\n\nTo close the meal out we had to order the olive oil cake.  The orange gave each bite a citrus hint.  The toasted almond crumble was a great texture add too.\n\nWould I return? Absolutely.  We snapped a picture of the bar during the walk out, as you can see it was full and busy!",

Our meat-and-potatoes crew found plenty to eat, but more adventurous eaters could try things like fresh Manchego. I particularly enjoyed the falafel and the flatbread served with the salads. I also love the presentation--beautiful plating while not being too fancy or fussy for a casual dinner.

We had the Patatas Bravas, Brussels sprouts, a salad that came with bread and cucumbers, chicken, and asparagus.

They do validate your parking deck tickets but if you valet you will have to pay. Valet was $12 which isn't bad for the area. I will definitely be back. They only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star is because the food was good but it's definitely not memorable. I also felt I left the restaurant hungry but we were $130 into the bill.

Our service was acceptable, but that's the best I can say about it.  But the food and drinks, mostly awesome.  We tried the Octopus (def get that) and the fried cheese off the small plates menu, both had great flavors. For my main I had the scallops, they were very good, but not the most melt in your mouth I've ever had. My date had the duck, the bite I had was delicious.  Oh...and I would normally never order a purple drink, but whatever their purple specialty cocktail was came recommended and I was so glad I chose it - I ended up having two!

SERVICE\nUnaccommodating waitress on a MONDAY with hiccups in communication with the kitchen ~ someone dropped the ball. We didn't get one of our orders on a day I would consider least hectic for restaurant businesses. It happens though. I can't imagine what it's like on a weekend. \nIII. QUALITY \nWhat gave this place a better rating. The flavors are paired so well. I would recommend specific items on the menu, but they change it fairly often (which is nice). \nIV.

With options for both indoor and outdoor, booth, table or bar, ..you can't go wrong with the seating. They have the perfect vibe for a large group or a small intimate date night.\n\nNow let's get to the food ! They have a nice variety of small plates, with a smaller selection of large entrees. Amount my brunch group, we tried just about every small plate. Although everyone had dishes they enjoyed, the collective fan favorites were the Skirt Steak and Brussels Sprouts. For my large plate I had the Shwarma Spiced Duck Confit, which was a tad bit dryer than I prefer, but was still very filling.\n\nI personally was not drinking, but there was a large variety on the menu and no complaints at the table once they were finished.\n \nLastly, we had great service from Jimm! He had plenty of food recommendations, and even took our group photo for us!",

The place was definitely busy but because of the layout it still felt intimate because the tables weren't crammed together. This would definitely be a good date night spot with the mood lighting they have. In keeping with their small tapas theme we ended up ordering multiple plates and sharing them. I tried the tirokroketes - fried goat cheese balls with an almond Romesco sauce and they were delicious. We also got to try three out of four of their desserts (cheesecake, chocolate tart, and tiramisu) and they were all quite good but the cheesecake was the clear winner - excellent. It's Buckhead so the prices felt on par with what you'd pay for any other restaurant in the area. Service was solid. The waitress attending to us was attentive without being intrusive and managed to keep tabs on our table as more people came to join. When she saw someone else joined she would check in and see what they wanted. Overall, I'd definitely recommend checking them out if you're in the area. Good food and good vibes.",

I ordered the scallops tapas and the mushroom and goat cheese toast. The toast wasn't toasted and the mushrooms were room temp. The scallops were cold and one was so fishy I thought I'd get sick but the dish did have potential based on green garlic potato puree / french curry / tomato jam / turmeric pickled mustard seeds-- all those flavors were great. \n\nThe drinks were pretty good. The overall bill wasn't bad at all. $45 for two small plates and a drink.\n\nAll in all, I won't be back. Unless just for drinks. Atlanta has so many other options.",

We had ample time to review the menu though lol. We shared several of the tapas which were good but not anything truly to write home about. My friend had the red sangria, which she liked. I had the razzi bone which was quite refreshing. I'd come back for after dinner cocktails and conversations, or maybe a happy hour if they had one, but that's it.\n\nFood rating \nBrussels 9/10\nScallops 7/10\nLamb skewers 7/10\nAsparagus 7/10\nSkirt steak 6/10\nRezzi Bone 9/10\n\nCustomer service 7/10\n\nAmbiance 10/10",

        "text": "A cool place with mediocre food. Portions are small, dishes are unmemorable, and pricing is less than desirable. I get that it's tapas and it's supposed to be small plates... however, there are other places that do tapas where the portions aren't as minuscule. Our table of four started with the rose sangria- that was good and pretty enjoyable. We ordered a few different tapas and they were all just okay which is disappointing for the price. What I do remember is the paella slightly having a weird taste, almost like something had gone bad or just too many flavors together that it has a slight garage taste to it? Unsure how to accurately describe. Service was good and the place itself promotes a fun, young atmosphere. Overall, would come back for a drink during happy hour and maybe one dish as a snack but not more than that.",

We have hosted corporate events with Gypsy Kitchen previously, and it was a breeze, so we opted for them again. Unfortunately, the communication and planning process was so frustrating that we will not be returning. for every 3-4 emails I would send the event manager, I would get 1 response, and she doesn't answer her phone either. Because of the lack of communication on their end, we were charged for items we did not approve of or want. We ended being charged an extra $500 for this event that was not included in the original proposal. I have been trying to communicate with the event manager to fix this and sort it out (and still am currently, two weeks after the event) but have gotten no help or response. Would not recommend going here, especially for an event.",

We got two tapas and a flatbread as well as two glasses of white wine. The tapas are $4 each. We got the patatas bravas and the chicken croquettes. We also got the chicken flatbread which was $10, although the other flatbreads they offer at happy hour vary in price. It was all great! The potatoes were a bit spicy - or at least the sauce was. The croquettes were delicious! So creamy on the inside. We also loved the flatbread! It had chicken, goat cheese and a balsamic drizzle. It was plenty of food for the two of us!

First glance the menu is best suited for people with acquired tastes. Menu is divided into small plates and large plates. The portions are small. I don't eat a lot so I ended up getting 2 small plates: falafel and the hot chicken bites. Both really good. Service was great, always fast and friendly. We walked in without a reservation and were seated in the outdoor area which is the more popular area to sit (Indoor usually looks empty). The waitress checked on us often. The vibes were great. Super aesthetic. Great for pics. There was a man playing guitar which added to the very loungy/bougie vibe. Overall great spot for appetizers and drinks if rooftop vibes are your thing.",

        "text": "Delicious food and swanky interiors and views! \n\nCame here Friday night for a girl's night dinner and reunion and honestly don't have anything to complain about. Parking is validated in the large garage underneath the shopping complex for up to 3 hours. The restaurant is located in an upscale area of Buckhead with tons of shops and restaurants. \n\nWe sat inside, but they had the patio doors open so we could see outside. People were dressed from smart casual to business formal and there was a birthday and wedding party in there.\n\nWe got the cheese board, brussel sprouts, octopus, patatas bravas, croquetas, and paella.\n\nCheese board - Good to share amongst 4 gals. They preslice the cheese which saves a lot of mess. Wasn't a big fan of the pickled veggies that come free with it though. They were pretty mushy and not pickled well. The meats and cheeses were great though. We got the manchego and mahon cheese paired with spanish sausage and jamon serrano. It also comes with a tomato jelly, pickled onions, and bread. \n\nBrussel sprouts - Crispy and light, everyone loved this.\n\nOctopus - Cooked really well -- crispy outside and chewy on the inside. Wasn't a fan of the sauces it comes with though. There's a yogurt sauce, black bean sauce, and tomato sauce. Thought the tomato was the most natural, but the octopus is seasoned just fine without these. The sauces are a bit too strong.\n\nPatatas bravas - I like how they used smaller potatoes and cut them into various sizes so it wasn't just cubes as I've seem at other restaurants. Really crispy. The sauce is also good and a bit more tangy than a typical aeoli. Quite enjoyed this one!\n\nCroquetas - probably my favorite -- perfectly crispy with a creamy inside. I think it came with 5, so more than enough to share. \n\nPaella - Rice was done well -- this one was a bit more on the soupy side with the sauce, and had peas. Fair amount of shrimp and mussels. \n\nFor dessert, we shared a tres leches cake that was delicious. A lot more cinnamon/berries than I've traditionally had with this cake, so it tasted kind of like the holidays, but it was a chilly night and this was perfect.\n\nService was great and they came by very often to check on us. Prices were fair, and I would say on the lower-medium side considering the area and other Atlanta tapas restaurants.\n\nOverall, would recommend and would love to come back! Would make a great place to take a date or anyone else you're looking to impress.",

Of course I got my favorite garlic shrimp, but today I tried something different on the menu. I tried one of the meat and cheese spread. I'm glad I did ! Im not to familiar with cheese and meat spreads so I asked the opinion of my waiter, and made my decision based off of his recommendations. Next time I'll def try the chefs board. My spread was one of the best spreads I've ever had. The cheese tasted so authentic and fresh. Now to end my review .. Olive Oil Cake. It's so light, refreshing, not too sweet not too tart. I've have olive oil cake at other restaurants and this one is truly the best !! They pair it with an almond crumble if you want to add a little sweetness or the sauce if you want to add a little bit of the tart to your cake.\nMy waiter Yetee was fantastic! He checked in and was am smiles the entire time. He gave great recommendations and was very knowledgeable of the menu. \nI had planned on visiting Spain pre pandemic, i definitely will seek visiting Spain soon due to the appreciation of this authentic restaurant!",
