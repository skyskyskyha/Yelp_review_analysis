There are a few tables to sit down and eat, but it definitely leans more toward takeout. \n\nEverything on the menu looked good, but I decided to go with a small shrimp and grits bowl ($13), since I haven't had grits in a while. I forgot to take a picture because it smelled so good that I just dove in, and by the time I remembered to take one, it was no longer aesthetically pleasing. The first thing I liked was that they removed the tails from the shrimp, so you don't have to discard them and get your hands dirty. The cheesy grits had excellent flavor and the dish had a mild kick to it. My only complaint was that it didn't work proportionately because I had a lot of leftover plain grits at the end. I love grits, but it hits different with the cheese and shrimp missing!\n\nService was friendly and the food was prepared quickly! I would definitely revisit to try their mac and cheese as well as some desserts.",

They could do better than that. \n\nThey have a big array of cake slices on display. \n\nAmazingly they were out of hot sauce!\n\nThe people were super nice. I would go back for a quick bite.

There was a long line and it appeared it was just her and the cook so she was getting flustered. Anywho, after placing my order it took about 25-30 minutes for my order to be ready. They give it to you in a takeout bag, even if you're eating there. I got a small jambalaya and it was good but nothing spectacular. Although the flavor was good, the rice was overcooked.",

The wife and I stopped in after a day of sightseeing around downtown Atlanta, and we could not have chosen a better restaurant. As soon as we walked in we knew it was going to be good. The restaurant was old and run down, but had those major hole-in-the-wall vibes. \n\nI ordered the small voodoo Mac and cheese with a small red beans and rice. My goodness, I'm glad I didn't get the regular size because it was PLENTY of food - and I'm a large man. It was enough to where we took the leftovers back to the hotel and had it for dinner too! My wife had the shrimp creole omelette and it was gigantic! She had plenty to take home for dinner also. \n\nThe best part about it was that the flavors were new to us and it was great trying something different. Everything tasted absolutely amazing and I would definitely love to come back. The service was also very friendly and welcoming.",

Our food was ready quickly given it was a primarily takeout place, but I found it a little pricy for that. Still really enjoyed the food once we got back to our hotel! The gumbo was deliciously seasoned and generously filled with sausage, chicken, and shrimp, though I would have liked some veggies too like okra or onions. The chicken creole pasta was also seasoned great and packed some heat. I do think the chicken in both dishes could be cut a bit smaller to make them easier to eat without a knife. All small complaints though, it was still a great surprise meal that reminded me how I should eat more Creole food!",

This was my first restaurant to try in Atlanta and I was super excited. When you first walk in, it looks like a small hole in the wall kind of place. \nThere's not a lot of place to sit but, their food options looked great. We ended up ordering their Yaya Pasta and Jambalaya. \nThe service was definitely not what I expected. The lady was kind of rude and not welcoming at all. I tried to have small talk and ask what they recommended and did not get any response. \nThe food on the other hand was amazing!! It was delicious! The spice level was perfect and it's a great spot to fulfill that southern food craving!",

The front desk provided a bunch of walking distance places but this place was not on the list and it should have been.\n\nI ordered the Red beans and rice with sausage, not chicken, and Angie's bread pudding. It was not disappointing, the RB&R was just the right amount of flavor and heat that made the meal taste great. Not too spicy but just enough to keep it traditional. Big chunks of smoked sausage and firm beans in a tasty sauce. At first I was a bit concerned about the portion but it was definitely a lot to eat.\n\nThe bread pudding was phenomenal, it was enormous and two people could have enjoyed it but I took it upon myself to indulge. The only thing that may have made it a bit better was to add some whipped cream \n\nI would have given a 5 star review but the restaurant is a bit small and the soda fountain was broken so I had to buy two cokes with the food. It was a bit hot and odiferous but I guess that adds to the ambiance. The young lady behind the counter was amazing in person and very sweet on the phone when I first called before I headed out which was a great first impression. The only regret I have is that I'm only in town for one night, otherwise I would be trying the Yaya next.",

A reasonable amount of chicken and shrimp were included, but the rice was low-quality and the dish had a heavy amount of added corn starch. At $14 for a small portion, it was a disappointment.",

The restaurant is very loud due to the blowing fans, the cashier was a short round woman and she seemed very irritated when providing service even though we were the only customers. \n\nI wanted to order one of their homemade drinks ($5) but she said they ran out of cups. The clear cups that they had were for another kind of drink. The prices are high once you see how your food is prepared. We dined in and everything was prepared in a meal prep container. The food was not very hot and tasted like it was previously prepared. \n\nI had the chicken mac, I didn't finish it and I didn't take my leftover home. The chicken was over cooked and very salty...the Mac and cheese was super oily. My fianc\u00e9 had the jambalaya, he said nothing tasted like it was made together and the celery was crunchy in the dish so he thought it was gristle.\n\nThe ambiance is a New Orleans carry out. The decor is okay. There is enough seating for about 15 people inside and some seats outside.",

We came in on a Monday evening and were seated immediately, though the food took around 30 mins to come out. Being the only patrons there, we expected quicker service... Or at least table service! You pick up your order (already packaged to-go) at the counter when they call your name.\n\nVOODOO JAMBALAYA: Far too sweet. They really drown this in BBQ sauce to the point where, IMO, it's nearly inedible. Hard to enjoy the actual Jambalaya and proteins when this is so overwhelmingly syrupy. Scraping the sauce off only made everything else taste bland. Welp\n\nMy coworker's Creole Chicken Pasta turned out wildly underwhelming... The chicken tasted a bit like tuna, while the pasta was completely bland. Smelled a bit like cat food. I'm hesitant to come back, even with the positive reviews. Maybe the kitchen had an off day...",

They give huge pieces of meat and plenty of sauce in the voodoo jambalaya for $19 \n\nOnly a few tables inside for seating so not good for groups.

But they were still letting you order things that are supposed to come with shrimps, like the jambalaya I wanted to order. (Along with everyone else). I didn't get it bc it Just didn't make any sense to pay the same price and not get half the ingredients. Not sure how they were okay still selling it. \n\nI ordered the chicken pasta instead, waited another 10+ mins to get it. \n\nExtremely underwhelming. Tasted fine but in a \"hamburger helper\" boxed dinner way. \n\nThought about going back to try the jambalaya another day but decided not to waste more money there.",

The jambalaya was super delicious. LOTS of sausage, shrimp, and chicken. Great cajun seasoning and sauces added on top. I loved every bite - they were all filled with so much flavor. \n\nStreet parking or the small parking lot at the end of the block. (FYI: They're VERY quick to ticket you if you forget to pay, even if you're just picking up ... ).\n\nHighly recommend and I will definitely go back! I need to try out the rest of their menu.",

The staff really need to be coached on providing better customer service. I will not go into details with what happened but on today there were two elderly females working the counter between 200pm- 03:00pm. The worker who actually provided the food to us was overly rude. With such great food, I am unsure why they would  allow anyone like her to work in their establishment.",

This restaurant is owned by a family from New Orleans. They are so\nSweet & kind. The wife is so humble like she really doesn't know that the ancestors are putting their feet in her food alongside hers... Back to the jambalaya... It was seasoned to perfection & I got the small portion but it had me full for the rest of the day. I knew it was going to be good when I ordered the lobster Mac & cheese and she told me that had been sold out SINCE THE MORNING...but the jambalaya did not disappoint at all!! It was sooo good.
