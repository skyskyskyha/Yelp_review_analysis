You probably forget about the time just sitting and watching the fishes swimming by. Highly recommended if you're in Atlanta, GA.",

        "text": "Mindblowingly amazing. \n\nIt baffles me how someone could gave this place less than 5 stars. \n\nThe Ocean Voyager on its own took my breath away as soon as I stepped into the tunnel and then my jaw dropped again when I saw the wall of glass and all the fish within it. The giant Manta Rays, the Whale Shark, the sting rays, and the hundreds? thousands? of fish inside the giant aquarium just living and swimming all together. What a beautiful sight. I've been to aquariums before but never to one like this. \n\nAll the other rooms of the aquarium was full of fishies to see and they were all quite impressive - beluga whales, penguins, otters, alligators, jelly fish, and so much more. I liked how the aquarium was organized into different rooms so it was very clear going from one section to the next. \n\nDolphin Show - get there 30 mins. early to get good seats. The show was SO much fun!! The dolphins did some things I've never seen in a show like this before. Get ready to get splashed if you are seated in the splash zone.\n\nSealion show - Also good but not as good as the Dolphin show. Cute and adorable and did some new unique things but very short show. Just wished it was longer. I liked how close I got to them though! \n\nTip: Reserve your spot in the shows early the day of. I learned that you don't have to wait until you enter the aquarium to reserve the spot. Just do it from the website in the morning!",

The dolphin show was amazing... the food court had a lot of options... it was beautifully decorated for Christmas... the staff was friendly.. and there was no wait to get into the aquarium. Parking in their garage is the smartest thing to do, and you can keep your car there and walk centennial park and near that area. The entrance to the aquarium was one of my favorite parts, they take your picture then you walk passed a huge wall full of jelly fish. Def come here. It's worth it - and a great in door activity for everyone. The diversity of marine life is insane.",

And every time I've complained about parking, ticket prices, lines, and a host of other things...pretty much everything I could think of.\n\nBut we went this fall for the first time in years and I must say that, outside of predictable ridiculousness at the food court, this was the best aquarium experience.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a 2 hour excursion doubled in length as the kids moved from zone to zone, filled equal parts apprehension and wonder in spots.  Petting the rays was a high point as was the sharks.  But each geographic region offered each kid a chance to show me that the forced hours listening to David Attenborough weren't in vain :)\n\nThe Atlanta City pass is recommended as it allowed us to leave the Aquarium and go right to the world of Coke pretty seamlessly",

I definitely recommend bringing your kids out to experience this view and taking memorable pictures. . . I probably wouldn't recommend the food i would say eat before you go but i get it kids are always hungry it's more like kids food or amusement park food frozen kinda stuff o guess If you ask me",

        "text": "When reflecting on my Georgia Aquarium visit less than two weeks ago, a couple words come to mind -- impressive and bustling. \n\nWe arrived on a Friday afternoon (right before spring break for at least some of the Atlanta area) around 2pm. I was concerned about the logistics, but everything was easy and straightforward. Yes, you have to deal with I-75 traffic which is never a joy, but the aquarium is located just 0.2 miles from the exit (at least this is the case driving from the northern suburbs). We were routed directly to the aquarium which deposited us in a large parking garage. Don't be deterred by The World of Coca-Cola signs on the garage as it does indeed serve the aquarium as well. \n\nDefinitely buy tickets in advance to save time as you enter. (We actually snagged ours during the car ride down.) A time slot must be selected, but there is a 1-hour grace period, so don't stress too much if you're running a bit late. I believe that a lot of local employers may offer discounts to the aquarium so check that out in advance as well. The tickets are definitely not cheap so any discount could help.\n\nWhen entering the aquarium, it was like no other aquarium I'd ever seen. The center is almost like being in the middle of a huge shopping mall with people swarming all over the place. The various exhibits have individual entrances, each with their own impressive signs and displays to draw you inside.\n\nWe visited Cold Water Quest, River Scout, Ocean Voyager, and Tropical Diver. I thought the division of animals was excellent and enjoyed the diverse feel of the different exhibits. The highlights for me were the lumpy beluga whales in Cold Water Quest, the enormous whale sharks in Ocean Voyager, and the glowing jellyfish in Tropical Diver.\n\nMy brother-in-law recommended skipping the show as he had been previously. He felt that between the long lines to get inside, the wait to see the show, and the content (he mentioned performers wearing costumes) that the show quality wasn't worth the time spent. \n\nIn the last 5 years or so, I've also visited the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga and the Newport Aquarium near Cincinnati. However, the Georgia Aquarium is hands down the most awe-inspiring. I would recommend visiting on a weekday to (try to) avoid the crowds. Plan a half day if you want to just walk through the exhibits and a full day if you want to also tackle the shows.",

Beyond the usual visuals, the shows are one of the highlights that you do not want to miss.\n\nAvoid buying food there since it is really pricey. I would make sure to eat in advance and bring a reusable water bottle to fill at the water stations.\n\nGreat experience otherwise. Amongst the exhibits (which you should visit all of them), I loved the Ocean Voyager the most. Definitely make time so you can take time watching it. The rest are great too. Have a splash!",

I was amazed at the whale sharks because what aquarium can say they have them? The Beluga whales were fascinating as well.  I also enjoyed looking at the reef tank with tropical fishes and corals.   I liked the shark tank they had and swirling fishes that were so shiny.  \nThe dolphin and seal show was pretty cool as well.  The kids really loved them.    The albino alligator was something you don't see everyday.  \nOverall, great place to visit while in ATL",

Once you've experienced everything, you'll probably leave thing the entry fee was pretty cheap. There's so much to see--sharks, beluga whales, alligators, sea lions, dolphins, and so much more. \n\nWe went to the sea lion and dolphin shows. I was getting SeaWorld vibes from the shows. You just have to use the QR code provided at the aquarium to make reservations to see these shows. \n\nTickets need to be purchased in advance. I'm not sure if this is something that's permanent or if it's just due to Covid. \n\nOverall, this place was exceptional. Definitely a must  see if you're in Atlanta.",

        "text": "WANT TO FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN?\n\nHere is where you can achieve that! I hadn't been to the aquarium and YEARS and I had a blast. And yes, I'm an adult but I truly enjoyed myself. I have always found fish to be fascinating and that have not changed. This is one of the better aquariums I've been to, they have a ton interactive activity and shows. \n\nThe dolphin show isn't anything you want to miss. I was literally on the edge of my seat. The dolphin are super well trained. The seat fill fast so I would suggest making it on time. Also, the top couple rows are in the splash zone!\n\nI did like that they had the escalating floors, I believe that's what it called. I thought that was super cool, the only other place I've ever seen that was Universal Studios and the airport. \n\nThe gift shop is major! You can find everything in there, I wasn't able to leave without getting something I just couldn't. \n\n\nIn my honest opinion, I would suggest eating prior to going or afterwards. The food was subpar and limited options wise. And on top of everything EXPENSIVE. And it's a lot of great restaurants walking distance nearby.\n\nYou also have to pay for parking and walk up to the attraction. Which is standard especially for the aquarium being in the heart of the city. Parking can run anywhere from $10-15 depending on the day and season. There was a lengthy line waiting to get in but it was for sure worth it. \n\nThey offer sleepovers if you want to have a super cool party for your child. \n\n**DISCLAIMER: the visit was Post-Covid so we were wearing mask, they were required at the time policy may have changed**",

There are parts of the aquarium that are beautiful to look at. Everything looked very well maintained and well done. I had fries, chicken tenders, and a cupcake from the cafe that were pretty good. The gift shop is cool and I recommend you bring your own bags to put what you buy in there because they stopped using plastic bags.

        "text": "We had a great day at this aquarium. Loved that you could buy tickets through their website in advance, even the day of. This place is huge. It's oddly kinda set up like a mall, with escalators, food court, and different \"store front\" designs if you will for the different exhibits. My favorite areas were the Ocean Voyager and Dolphin Coast. The Ocean Voyager was just one giant tank and had some stadium type seating you could rest upon while you just take it all in. It is just amazing how many different creatures coexist under the sea. It was just a very serene area that allowed for some great reflection time. Dolphin coast was super fun to just watch the Dolphins zoom around. We sadly missed the last Dolphin show for the day, but honest just watching this amazing mammals was pretty awesome. \n\nCafe aquaria is geared towards families with mostly combos of chicken tenders, pizza, or cheeseburgers with fries and soda. It's a big aquarium so you are gonna be there a while and get hungry, so they know they got a captive audience so will but whatever. We went for the chicken fingers combo. The food was of course as expected very overpriced and mediocre in taste at best. Thank god for honey mustard. They did have self-serve soda fountains, so you could get drink refills at least (but you aren't allowed to take it out of the cafe area). There was a grab and go section that did have a couple varying options as well. \n\nThe ultimate highlight of the day was the 4D Theatre. There wasn't an additional cost to attend, but you did have to reserve tickets for one of the show slots in advance. Our film was by Blue Planet about the Octopus. The Octopus already scares the crap out of me, but watching them on the big screen in 4D with all these special effects was next level. You got wind and water elements, bubbles from the sky, and a poker in the back of your seat to name a fee. I legit yelled out loud when I first got poked as it scared me. I laughed (and many others in the audience) so hard at myself when it happened. It was a super fun thing for kids and adults alike. \n\nSo many animals, activities, and adventure. I see why this aquarium comes so highly regarded. It's also right by the Coca Cola and Civil rights museum as well as other attractions. Could make a big day of it all if you'd like. But honestly I'd say the aquarium is already a lot. If you are into the world under the sea, I absolutely recommend you make this part of your Atlanta plans.",

They have an octopus, whale sharks, other sharks, river fish, beluga whales. Just to name a few! Those were my favorites!!! \n\nNow to the facility, this is the largest aquarium I have ever been to. The tanks are huge, walkways are huge, everything is big! They were doing some renovations while I was there so I'm sure they are just making it more grand! \n\nThis is centrally located within the city. Now what's so cool about it is that the aquarium, world of coke, and the national center for human rights is all with the same shared parking garage and you just cross a small green space to go from place to place. You could easily knock out all 3 in an afternoon. Highly recommend just paying the $20 to park there and visit all three! \n\nThe price is steep!!! But I would pay it any day. This aquarium is worth all the traffic you will sit through in Atlanta to get there!!!! 10/10!!!!",

For these you walk through a tunnel and the tank is above you. Similar to Jaws III when the shark rams the tank.\n\nBefore going, make sure you book your tickets online because there are timeslots.\n\nIt's super crowded and you're not likely to get the Insta-pick you want due to the crowds. If you're like me and go for the animals and the experience, you'll like it.\n\nI didn't get a chance to see the shows, because they were sold out, but the whole experience took me about 1 hour and 50 minutes. \n\nThe food didn't seem worth it and I'm glad I didn't buy it.",

        "text": "Alright, story time. \n\nMy husband, son, and I visited the aquarium on a Thursday summer morning. As expected, it was crowded and loud. This I do not mind. Kids are out from school and it's a major attraction in a major city.\n\nWhen you first arrive you pose for a picture at the entrance that you can then decide if you're going to purchase later. \n\nThere is plenty to see and observe at the aquarium. Some of my favorite exhibits include the puffins, beluga whales, dolphins, sea otters, and whale shark. There is information located on the walls to read. It's very informative. I encourage you to take some time to read some of it.\n\nWe watched the dolphin show at the 1130 slot. It lasted around 15 minutes. It was cute and the dolphins did some tricks. You must reserve your time and do arrive early if you want a seat in the center. \n\nFor as large as a facility as it is, the bathrooms are relatively small and tight. The bathrooms at a Buc-ee's gas station really set the bar high. Georgia Aquarium may want to take notes. \n\nThere is an area to purchase food and sit down. It's convenient especially for those with children who are complaining that they're starving and \"disintegrating\" from lack of nourishment. (Anyone else's kid as dramatic as mine?) \n\nThere's a parking garage attached to the aquarium that you pay before leaving.\n\nAll in all, I always enjoy my visits there. Already planning the next one with my coworker.",

None of these would let you down. The staff were friendly and helpful to answer questions. It is easy to spend 4-6 hours here.  This is absolutely one of the top aquarium in the world. \n\nI would strongly recommend to go to the dolphin show and sea lion show. The trainers did a fantastic job explaining how dolphins and sea lions were trained and proactively promoting to save the planet! I would also recommend the behind the sea tour for those who would like to learn what kind of research the aquarium is sponsoring/conducting!",

        "text": "I was so excited to see whale sharks! Very cool experience. The moving pathway has a line to wait in but it's nice to not stand and it slowly moves you. The right side is normal walking which doesn't have a line. \n\nBe warned that if there's a huge line somewhere just walk away and do something else for a bit and come back around and it may be empty! You don't have to just follow the crowds. \n\nBiggest bummer was missing the dolphin show. There was no indication i had to reserve a spot ahead of time. I am very disappointed this was never communicated so we had to wait 2 hours or miss it. \n\nThere was a feeding time for the whale sharks  which was awesome to watch. Ask the employees when it's happening.\n\nBeautiful environments but the sponsored Home Depot stuff was really weird.",

I was blown away by how spot on the staff has made every feature here the best experience for ALL the visitors and critters. There are places that animals in tanks can be near or away from the viewing portals of humans, as they choose, signage that tells the stories of the conservation work the diverse individuals associated with the place, and well educated staff who really get the word out there to the public. Constantly updating and improving, they really do take visitor comments into account on their surveys and in person, and make positive changes. It really is hard to imagine a better, more immersive way to learn without feeling like you're part of an ark situation that was the aquarium model in the \"olden\" days! If this is the direction we're headed as a society, we're doing it justice!",

Georgia aquarium is the only aquarium outside of southwest Asia to have them. I feel luckyI got to see them.  There are so many sharks here! I have never seen so many big shark in one tank outside of Toronto. Incredible!\n\nOf course the main attraction for me was  the Dolphin show. These amazing creatures have the ability to uplift any grumpy mood. I walked out of the auditorium feeling so happy. I also loved the otters and penguins. \n\nI felt the aquarium was very organized. The exhibit were well delineated, we didn't have any trouble at all following our own pattern and remember what we saw and what we hadn't seen yet. Everything was so very clean. Sanitizer stations were all over and most areas have plexiglass dividers. \n\nThis is suck an amazing place. If you come to Atlanta, Georgia Aquarium is a MUST!!!",

        "text": "From tiny bioluminescent flashlight fish to 28 ft whale sharks, this place is Impressive! Wait, that's an understatement. There is no way to describe just how I enthralling the overall experience is.\n\nGo!\nFun facts: \nLargest aquarium on this side of the world\nNon Profit\nHome Depot founder donated the aquarium\nCoca-Cola donated the land\nCorporate Sponsors added $40 million\nAdmissions are used to run the facility\n\nThe facility has the largest veterinarian staff of any aquarium in the world.\n\nIf you are within 100 miles of here, drop everything and Go! Yes, that's how good it is.\n\nI went online to check it out and was offered a discount on parking. so I bought my ticket and parking online which was a breeze, The facility is downtown but, easy to find and park. Tip, do take your parking stub because you have to pay by the elevators, I had to walk back to my car to retrieve said Stubb.\n\nIt was much busier for a weekday than I anticipated but, things moved smoothly with a well-trained staff. As you enter, you are confronted by a huge room with a giant screen playing ocean scenes. As your eyes scan the perimeter you quickly get the idea of how it's laid out. There is a QR code you can scan if you want a map. I generally just wing it and I did this time also. I found it unnecessary to use a map to find  attractions and easily navigate the entire facility,\n\nAs you move through the building and exhibits one thing I noticed right away is the attention to detail and quality of design and construction right down to top-grade materials. For example, the carpet is high quality with design elements that match the overall ocean scheme. Painting designs on the walls, guard rails, signs, you name it, and it's all esthetically pleasing.\n\nThis attention to \"the best\" continues into every exhibit. The designers had to win many awards on this because it's fabulous.\n\nI spent about 31/2 hours here and saw everything but could have easily spent another 2 hours. I have scuba-dived all my life and looking into this aquarium is the closest I've ever felt to being underwater while out. The number and size of fish are astounding and I'm sure an interesting book could be written on the intricate operation it takes to make the wheels turn here.\n\nAgain, Go!!!!",

Instead they give you the option of stale sandwiches, microwaved pizza and flavorless fries. The food choices were awful. And for an organization that's often promoting less plastic use, they use a ton of plastic in their cafeteria.\nI also deducted a star for their app. The app is awful and often went to their actual website to get information I wanted that the app didn't offer.",

        "text": "What a beautiful place! I was so excited to see so many whales! Obviously the belugas and whale shark was my favorite and the main attraction for me, there were so many things to explore including the shark area, sea lion and seal show, alligators, dolphins, tons of jellies and fish! They have a great cafeteria and gift shop! I got a souvenir cup, beluga plush, whale shark shot glass, and beluga magnet. We loved our picture taken at the beginning that we got at the end of our day! We loved the sting Ray touch pond and the various ecosystems! Definitely recommend for any and all ages. We had a blast I can't wait to go back and do some of the activities available!",

        "text": "I love the Georgia Aquarium and all that it has to offer. I've been to the aquarium twice in the past month with different family, friends, and their children and each time it's been such a pleasure! I definitely agree with another user in saying that I wish there were more activities for adults at night because exploring the aquarium with 200 screaming kids can be a lot. My friend came from out of town last week and she had the same sentiments. I definitely think adding an adult event even if it were monthly, what's serve as beneficial for the aquarium and fun for those of us who love aquatic animal life. If you have time, I recommend attending one of the different shows each time once you've been to each exhibit. The food is Museum priced food, overpriced and not great, they have someone who does caricatures and photo booths, they also take photos of you when you first get in to purchase at specific kiosks or the museum or at the gift shop. Super fun stuff. Dear Georgia Aquarium, please consider doing something for the big kids at heart. Thanks!",
