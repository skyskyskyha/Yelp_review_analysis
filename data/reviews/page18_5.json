My husband and I order for pick-up and here now as our place to get sushi in Buckhead. \n\nMy only suggestion is that I've noticed the prices are different on the delivery apps than on the pick-up menu. We live .7 miles away, so it's usually just easier to pick up, but I wish the delivery prices on apps like UberEats, Postmates, etc weren't $2-$3 higher + the additional fees. \n\nFor the food, we are consistent around getting 2 special rolls, 1 regular roll and an app and soup. That's what we like. \n\nSuper Crunchy Roll\nNova Roll\nBeauty and the Beast Roll\nAll great!",

Also, the spicy garlic edamame was delish (got the sauce on the side). My friend and I were very pleased. It was our first time here. We sat at the bar and the sushi chefs were so sweet. I asked them for extra ginger and they gave me an entire saucer full of it (which I ended up eating the entire thing). Will definitely visit again! ...there was a wait when we walked in so must be a super poppin place!",

They were both absolutely delicious and refreshing, but I loved the Surf and Turf more. There was a thinly sliced layer of filet mignon on top and that really made the difference. It was so good!! The slivered green onions were a perfect addition and really enhanced the overall flavor of the roll. I definitely recommend Nova Sushi! A bit pricey, but it is in buckhead, a block away from Phipps plaza, so what do you expect lol. Worth it!",

        "text": "Nova is our favorite sushi spot in Atlanta. The fish is always fresh and the sushi rolls available are really tasty and creative. The hot food is also really good if you are in the mood for a rice or noodle dish. The staff is friendly and food does not take too long to prepare. A lot of sushi places have really sour tasting rice due to the vinegar used (nothing wrong with this but I personally don't like that sour aftertaste) , but I found that Nova's sushi does not have that sour aftertaste at all. The sushi \"pizza\" is delicious and any of the rolls are great too - you can't go wrong. The Thai Basil Fried Rice is also super delicious. Easily one of our favorite restaurants in the area due to their reliability and great tasting food.",

The wait staff and guys behind the bar making the rolls and sashimi were very friendly and accommodating. Place is also very casual and don't feel pressured if you are going in alone to enjoy sushi on your own. \n\nVery friendly place and they also have a tv to watch any game you'd like. I highly recommend this place whether it's with a group or if you're going solo like i did. Their rolls and sashimi were great and if you like regular rolls they have an amazing 3 for $18 deal that is out of this world. \n\nI will definitely be going back and try to become a regular there. My goal in the end i want to try all of their rolls and entrees. Look forward to m next visit.",

I'm a huge fan of their sushi but I dock my 1 point as I wasn't as impressed by their noodle or meat dishes.\n\nTheir sushi has always come out decorated beautifully with faux flowers and leaves or intricate large plates. The traditional maki rolls like Spicy Tuna, Salmon, etc are always flavorful and fresh. I've only tried 2 specialty rolls - but both have been delicious and beautiful as well. The prices are very comparable, if not more affordable than nearby sushi places (Tomo, UMI) but the quality is much higher than other low-cost sushi places (RuSan's, Maki Fresh). To me, Nova is the perfect medium that lets me get a great roll combo at a decent price.\n\nI've also tried their pad thai which was too greasy and saucy for me as there was red oil running off the flat noodles. I am a fan of their Hot & Sour Soup even though it has tomatoes and white mushrooms in it instead of the traditional bamboo shoots and woodear mushrooms. \n\nFor dessert, I highly recommend the Tempura Fried green tea ice cream. It's a good portion and the tempura batter is delicious on the cold milky matcha ice cream.\n\nService has always been decent. Nothing over the top but I wouldn't define Nova as fine-dining. It's just my go-to spot for quality sushi!",

I ordered the shrimp tempura reg roll, chicken tempura reg roll, the spicy tuna roll, and their lemon pepper chicken wings. The shrimp tempura was amazing!!! I can't get Over how good it was. The chicken tempura was just as tasty. The tuna roll was ok..6/10 alittle mushy for my taste. The chicken wings were burnt... I was very disappointed because the chicken had a great flavor smh. Overall I'd definitely order from here again, I can't wait to dine in!",

I went for the salad which was OK. A lot more dressing that I typically find at such restaurants - which can be good or bad depending on your tastes. For my main meal, I ordered the beef teriyaki bento box. The roll was pretty good and the gyoza was fine. However, I did not enjoy the teriyaki sauce and I hated the rice. I had never seen such rice before. Way too dense and grainy for me. I ate as little of it as possible with my teriyaki. I would have much preferred white rice. I did try my friend's tempura veggies and they were pretty good. Let's just sum it up as she enjoyed her lunch much more than I enjoyed mine.",

We were expecting a long long meal, but afterwards we realized how quick it was and we were looking for something else to do to burn time before going home. We were not at all rushed at any point, they were just really efficient. \n\nQuality of the fish was outstanding. The super spider roll was delicious as were the salmon lovers and tuna lovers combos. So fresh and flavorful. And it was a lot of food! The roll was huge and the salmon and tuna sashimi and sushi pieces were double the size of other restaurants. We left incredibly full and very satisfied.\n\nExcellent value for money. Sushi is more expensive than other cuisines. It just is. That said, the prices here given the quality and portion sizes was excellent.\n\nThis is now our go to sushi place in Buckhead. They run effective pick up business as well if you aren't dining out these days.\n\n(All serving staff and chefs were wearing masks and there was hand sanitizer on every table.)",

I have to say, it's hard to eat everything because the plates are so big. The plates took so much space that we had to consolidate our food into different plates. Overall the food was good and the service great.",
