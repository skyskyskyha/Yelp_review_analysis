Our server was attentive and helpful as well. \n\nMy date ordered a vegetarian curry and I ordered the Lamb Hung Lay and y'all!!!! The curry the lamb was bathed in was so thick and creamy. The lamb itself was the perfect texture, soft and tender with still a bit of chew. It was perfect. My only complaints were the potato pieces in the curry were a bit underdone and the whole ginger shavings on top were a bit much to compliment the dish but I just pushed them aside and dug in.\n\nThe meal came with a cucumber salad was was deliciously refreshing and a yellow rice that was a bit much for such a flavorful meal. I would have preferred a plain white rice to accompany my meal. \n\nWe also ordered the dragonfruit margaritas our server recommended and it was FABULOUS. All in all I will definitely be back for that curry. I dream of it.",

        "text": "My husband and I decided to visit for a date night dinner. We made reservations online and arrived for the dinner service. Upon arrival the valet workers were very friendly. Once we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with warmth. The design and architect of the restaurant was very elegant. Our waitress was very kind and informative of the menu. I enjoyed the diversity of the menu including the cocktails and entrees. We started with the ginger blossom and dragon fruit cocktail. For my entree I ordered the Kai Yang Massaman (Grilled lemongrass chicken breast, massaman curry, avocado, green bean, roasted cashew nut, pickled shallot, cucumber salad, jasmine rice) and my husband ordered the Thai Barbecue Lamb Chops with Crispy Lobster Tail. This was by far the best curry and flavorful chicken I've had. The curry was sweet and savory with a light kick. I highly suggest getting this dish. Additionally I appreciate the chefs for accommodating my gluten free and dairy free lifestyle!",

        "text": "Updated review after 5 years:\n\nWe came here for a business lunch, with 2 vegetarians in our team and two omnivores.  This 4-diamond restaurant is regarded as one of the best Thai restaurants in Atlanta.  Its easy to see why, with the gorgeous well-lighted interior, friendly and prompt service, and sizable menu of both traditional Thai-dishes and interesting fusion dishes.\n\nThe Nan Tasting Tree is a great shareable appetizer sampler for four people.  Solid dishes were calamari and chicken satay.  For vegetarians they had spring rolls, and half of the fried egg rolls (the other half contains shrimp).  Overall pretty good, though one dish was not my favorite - chicken dumplings were a bit bland.\n\nLobster Pad Thai was an expensive ($45!) entree and had a fried half lobster tail along with a skewer of sautéed scallops.  Both were seasoned well, though texture-wise a bit chewier than I liked.  Pad Thai itself was on the sweet side.  Not sure I would order this again since I prefer \"too spicy\" as opposed to \"too sweet.\"  \n\nIMHO, the best Thai food seems to have a bit of both - in-your-face spicy followed by some sweetness and acidity.  If I come back here in the future, I'll probably stick to the traditional Thai dishes.",

We enjoyed yet another great meal here on Feb 15th when they were serving a slightly reduced menu (but not a prix fixe menu) for Valentines weekend.\n\nAs usual, the service is great from the moment you walk in and are welcomed with a traditional Thai greeting.  The servers at Nan in my experience are consistently very good to great. \n\nOn this occasion we enjoyed the following:\n\nCalamari - lightly fried and served with a tamarind dipping sauce.  This is one of the best versions of this classic appetizer I've had in the city.\n\nLobster Pad Thai - a full lobster tail served with a mildly spicy version of this classic.  Excellent dish that was on the Valentines weekend menu.\n\nKai Siam -  chicken breast stir fried with chili, onions, cashew nuts, and other veggies served on a fresh cut portion of pineapple and with a delicious pineapple fried rice.  First time I've had this dish and it won't be the last.  I normally lean toward the spiciest Thai dishes, but this relatively mild dish was absolutely delicious. \n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed the Coconut Cake served with Coconut Ice Cream.  It's a large dish and definitely suitable to share.\n\nIt is great to see Chef Nan's flagship restaurant continuing to execute their food and service in such a fantastic manner.",

The fried rice was favorful, but it should never be  more than $20 for a plate. There is no justification for rice to be that expensive in any type of restaurant. Unless maybe there is gold flakes and truffles added. \n\nTom yum soup was just broth with some flavoring and shrimp and scallions. This was the biggest disappointment. \n\nThe fish was fine. It was de-boned and skinned. I wished the skin remained on. It would be nice to have the crispy skin. My favorite part of the fish was the minced chicken. \n\nOur waitress (Dawn) was super nice and helpful!",

Nan brings that out 100%.\n\nThe staff is extremely friendly and they try to implement the Thai customs to making it pleasant when you eat there. While the prices are a bit high, $20 a person for dinner, the portions are not tiny at all. It is a healthy amount of food to the point where it is satisfying enough to feel good that you spent your money well. I also liked the Tom Yum soup which was a great mix of spice and savory. They also did not skimp on the seafood, which so many Thai restaurants tend to do. \n\nThe restaurant also has valet parking for those who want to drive there. \n\nOne little tip, do not come here with a hat or tank tops. While it is rather informal, I would come dressed a bit nicer so that way the staff treats you better. Also, be nice to the staff. They work hard to ensure that you are having a wonderful experience from the time you are seated until the time you walk out of the restaurant.",

The level of service has never wavered, it has been of the best quality each and every time. \n\nThe only thing that out shines the service is the culinary  wonderment that comes out of the open kitchen. The chef, sous chefs and everyone else should be proud. The surf and turf aka lobster fried rice w/ lamb chops was sublime. The apps are small but packed with flavor and the beverages bring it all together. \n\nTo have this level of sustained service for this many years is outstanding. Well done!!",

Me and my wife constantly had to remind her that we needed water, our alcoholic beverages were forgotten, and several times she attempted to rush us out of the restaurant. Some things/observations can be convoluted perceptions based on the lens that you're trying to view them from or make sense of, I couldn't make sense of her distasteful customer service.  Moreover, I'm not trying to give a class on \"Class.\" I took the high road and I decided to give her a tip that was more than she should've received.  I hope that anyone else that dines here never has to leave Nan Thai Fine Dining in Atlanta with the perception that they're not welcomed.  \n\nSincerely never to return,\n\nTerrance Simon (foodie and citizen)",

We have tried so many different Thai places and have enjoyed so many different dishes. \nHowever, Nan Thai Fine Dining has surpassed them all! Our food included: Kai Siam, Chicken Pad Thai, Chicken Basil Fried Rice. \nThe Kai Siam was an amazing crispy chicken dish that was very flavorful. Not only the chicken was cooked to perfection, the vegetables were coated in flavor. I definitely recommend getting this dish. \nThe Chicken Pad Thai was to die for. I have had pad thai numerous times, but none compare to this one. The sauce that the pad Thai was made with was filled with flavor that every bite was like eating it for the first time all over. \nThe Chicken Basil Fried Rice was amazing. Basil fried rice is supposed to be a simple dish that accompanies the main dish. However, this Basil fried rice was our favorite thing that we ordered. It not only was coated and covered in that aromatic taste, but it also was moist and so delicious! \n\nOverall, this was a great experience. Yes it is on the higher end, but it is completely worth every penny! \n\nNot to mention the staff! Bon our server served us as if we were his family. Explained and answered all our questions and made us feel comfortable ordering our food. \nNam, the manager, came to our table and made us feel comfortable. And explained the amazing pad thai, which made us all the more excited about the food we ordered. \nI was so impressed by the food, and with the great service from the staff it just made our dinner experience the best we have ever had.",

        "text": "This place was wonderful. We were stuck in the house for our birthdays in April and May, so we had a late celebration out at Nan's. The appetizers were on point. Coconut shrimp soup was fabulous. All of our dishes were incredible. See descriptions with pictures. Our teenage sons began planning to come back for their birthday dinners before they even finished their food. Dessert was great too. Coconut cake and coconut ice cream were heavenly. Cream brûlée and chocolate mouse cake were yummy too. Also, the fired okra is not on the menu but they have it. Delish! Prices are a little on the higher end, but so worth every penny. Great celebration place or date night! Thanks to Mama Mia for a great evening!",

We ordered a ton of dishes and everyone of them had a unique flavor and was prepared well.  A favorite was the sea bass with eggplant!  I have already recommended this to another corporate planner.  \n\nThey also have a great option for private dinning!",

        "text": "We were on a road trip that took us through Atlanta. In the mood for some Thai food, we found Nan, and it did not disappoint! We had the calamari and tea rose dumplings to start- both were delicious! The calamari was so light and crispy, and served with a tangy sauce. The dumplings were very unique, slightly sweet but also savory. We also split the Thai BBQ lamb chops, and everything about it was delicious! Cooked perfectly and such great flavors! Our waiter was so great as well.",

        "text": "Food: 8/10\nService: 10/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10\n\nAn impromptu Sunday evening date with my wife ended up being a pretty memorable dining experience.  The interior combines a sleek and clean modern vibe with plenty of traditional Thai flair sprinkled in, and the open view into the kitchen is always fun.  My wife and I ordered a few different cocktails (and a Thai tea), all of which were well balanced and complimented the food.  Well-timed, helpful service made for a really relaxing and enjoyable time.\n\nWe ended up trying the tea rose (phenomenal and incredibly artfully made) and calamari (good, but not remarkable) for appetizers, and then went with the duck (very good and flavorful, but a tad overcooked for my liking) and the seafood curry Panang Talay.  The true star of the meal ended up being the incredible scallops, which were huge and perfectly cooked!  I really think this might have been among the best scallops I've ever had!\n\nNext time I'd be curious to try the snapper special, but there will definitely be a next time now that we're aware of this gem.",
