She so happened to be covering a Friday shift, because she's normally there on the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays). She was so sweet and kind and her drinks were on point!!! I had (several) a lychee peach lemon drops and a french 75. She did not disappoint. I hope that management understands how much of an asset she is to the restaurant, because she made my overall experience amazing. I'm definitely coming back just to see her and have drinks. \n\nThe food was delicious, fast, and of quality. You can tell the chef/cooks are paying attention to details. I had the seafood gumbo, GA honey hot fried chicken and catfish with a side of macaroni, and the blackened salmon and shrimp. Everything was great! That honey hot sauce is a must!!! \n\nThe restaurant was cute, clean, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.",

We didn't have reservations as this was a spur of the moment kind of thing and we drove an hour and half to visit Atlanta. We were told it would be a 90 minute wait. According to their policy, you technically have 90 minutes to dine so it appears we were simply waiting for a table to become available. We were seated at 1:21 pm. I didn't realize the dining area was so small. \n\nOverall, we loved our food. If you're concerned about the dress code, there are wasn't any. Just be you! The only reason I'm awarding four star is because I have to consider that if we had not ordered our food when we initially sat down, it would have taken forever to receive our dishes. We didn't receive our food until 1:56 pm. It seemed like forever and just took too long.",

I've never had fried green tomatoes with blue cheese, wasn't my thing. The catfish and grits were really. I didn't give 5 stars bc I couldn't exchange a dish. That braised beef rib skillet was definitely not braised short ribs at all. Taste like overcooked beef stew. So I had to pay for something I couldn't stomach. You really can't talk about service bc gratuity is added no matter what. You get what you get. My group thought the food was just ok, not amazing. I did enjoy the catfish and lemon drop martini.",

        "text": "Had the opportunity to go to Toast on Lennox's new midtown location for a girls brunch during what I like to call \"Beyoncé weekend\".\n\nThe good: The food is bomb! I had the sweet potato waffle with the fried lobster tail. Definitely pricey at almost $50, but was delicious and worth the indulgence. I also had the Mac and cheese which was good as well. Most of the party got Mimosas. They were ok, for almost $20 each I expected them to be made with fresh muddled fruit for flavoring but the flavoring was from syrup. If I go back I'd likely try a different beverage option. \n\nThe bad: The wait . We each tried to make a reservation both online and via phone but never got a hold of anyone. One of my friends got to the restaurant at 11a and put our party of 8 down for a table. We were told a 1-1.5 hour wait max. Fast forward 2 hours and we were still waiting. Each time we checked on our wait time we were told \"soon,  soon\". It took us 3 hours to be seated! Now, I totally understand that we did not have reservations, but if you could not accommodate our party - just say that! Don't have us waiting in the hot ATL sun for hours on end. If I went back it'd only be with a reservation or on a weekday.\n\nSee more on my IG @dr_kjsmith",

        "text": "I attended Toast Midtown for the birthday on a Friday morning and it was probably the best experience I had while dining out in a while.\nOkay from the top...\nReservations- booked online and honored perfectly.\nParking- a little confusing as there is no street parking but signs pointing down the street to park in the Spice House parking lot which is ample. My reservations were pretty early at 930 so there was plenty parking. I believe it's Valet but maybe I avoided it by the time of our reservations since it was so early.\nFood- amaze balls. We ordered the seafood dip, crab Benedict, small order of bananas foster French toast and the basic breakfast (forgot the name) that has eggs, chicken sausage and a biscuit with grits. Everything was tasty and not overpowering. We had a mimosa and a peach sweet tea which tasted great also.\nThe service- A1. Our hostess and waiter were great. Our server who I think was either Leon/Luis was great. He was very attentive not overbearing and knowledgeable about the menu. Greatest service I've had in a while. \nAmbiance- perfectly decorated. Even the bathrooms were nicely decorated equipped with hand salt, lotions and soaps.\nThere is an outside area but given it August it had a lot of flies when I went to take photos. So I'd probably stay in.\nI'm booking my next trip to toast right now!",

        "text": "I love this place because of the food! There are many Black-owned brunch spots in ATL but to date, this is my go to. Definitely make a reservation because even though they've opened a second location in Midtown, but stay packed every day. I've been twice and the first visit was excellent. We had a vibrant male server and a nice table in the main dining room. You will see interesting wardrobe choices and often very scantily dressed women - sort of the \"City Girls\" vibe. There is a small bar so you might luck up and find a seat there. Anyway the second visit was not so wonderful. I was entertaining a colleague from Dallas, made a reservation and arrived 10 minutes earlier. Another part of two jumped in front of us as we were approaching the door, and the hostess seated them in the main dining room without reservation. When she got to us (did have a reservation) she put us in the back dining room which is an unsightly plain box with very little decor or thought- like the overflow dining room in a church basement lol. I REALLY did not want to sit in that room and asked if we could be seated at either of the 2 booths open and she said no they were for others (??) What's worse is when we acquiesced to the back room there was a couple with a new baby back there. When I'm paying over $100 to eat, I prefer not to be around kids and babies. So the food was again excellent but honestly the calloused hostess pretty much ruined it for me. If they're going to have that back room, spruce it up so guests don't feel like they're in punishment or banished to the kiddie section. Female server was cool but not as engaging as the gentleman we had previously. You know in the way out I spied those 2 booths designated for others. One was still empty when we're left :(  Love the cuisine but because I am an excellent tipper, I have to decide whether it's worth it coming back.  If you haven't been, do go!!  5 stars on cuisine & menu. 3 stars on hostesses & that god awful back room",

        "text": "Toast on Lenox is very much still a hot spot for the who's who in Atlanta. You may spot a micro influencer, or maybe a reality tv star, you may not. Wait times are not for the weak and hungry... Waiting will occur. \n\nThere is parking and valet. I would opt for the valet because you'll be waiting to eat anyway. They do not play about reservations. Every staff member will ask you if you have them on your way in, including security. \n\nOne of my girlfriends decided to have her birthday brunch here and it was not too bad of a wait, although all of us had to be there to be seated. Once I got there, we had to weigh an additional 15 minutes and we were seated.\n\nOur server was Caleb, and he was very professional and helpful with the menu and any questions we had. He also served me a mocktail (not on the menu) which was delicious! The food itself is pretty good. My friend ordered the Cajun seafood dip for the table (8/10), which was served with a baguette, pre-cut to tear off slices as you ate, I ordered the beef short rib breakfast skillet. it came with a horseradish aïoli, which was surprisingly good with the potato and short rib. Yum! My friends ordered the honey hot fried catfish, shrimp and grits, and chicken and waffles, and based on their plates they liked the food! Drinks were also really good.\n\nI like Toast because not only is it Instagrammable and great for photo-ops but the food is pretty good as well. Overall, they could do better with wait times and reservations but I would definitely recommend if you've never been.",

        "text": "Toast on Lenox has been on my list of \"must try\" brunch spots for a long time. Finally I was able to snag a week day reservation on my hubby's birthday. Weekend reservations are pretty hard to get. When we arrived, the host seated us immediately and our server greeted us within seconds. Everything we ordered was yummy...not over or under seasoned. My very picky hubby ordered the apple cobbler French toast with honey hot fried wings on the side and a Manmosa.  10 out of 10! He liked it so much he ordered 3 orders of wings to go. I opted for the beef short rib breakfast scramble and a passion fruit mimosa. The short rib was so tender and flavorable. My only dilemma is when are we coming back??",

My goodness! This food was phenomenal.  \n\nThe gumbo has plenty of seafood and chicken. So much flavor. The chicken waffles are the perfect balance. I was a little concerned it would be overly sweet because of the green and caramel but it's not! It's the perfect balance of salty and sweet. The chicken was crispy and perfect. Everything was great!\n\nThe prices are high BUT fitting for Buckhead. AND they're worth it. The food is THAT good!\n\nFood was served very , very quickly and the staff was very friendly. \n\n20/10 I recommend!",

        "text": "Food is good, service is a hit or miss, ambience is boogie and the coffee is cold.  \n\nWe chanced upon some Yelp reviews on a way to another brunch spot and decided to give it a try! My first trip was as a party of 4. Minimal wait to sit outside (which we did) but a long one to be seated inside without reservations. The walk from our car was longer as the entire lot was full (and half was valet?). However you WILL find a spot and it's free parking. \n\nSince this was our first visit our server told us about all the items on the menu, built up a few and gave us plenty of time to order. We got the skillet, all the French toasts, the avocado toast, salmon cakes. OMG the food was great. I loved the skillet - beef was soft and seasoned so well. And I got some nice over easy eggs that were cooked beautifully. The strawberry shortcake French toast was divine and felt like a dessert after my skillet. These were my favorite two dishes so far. I heard no complaints from the others on my table to I assume everything was top notch. \n\nWe ordered coffee for everyone and I must say that was a disappointment. My first cup was cold and came after a long long time after I ordered it. Our French toasts came out sooner. The second cup took even longer and it was warm at best.\n\nHowever, our server made up for the experience, with the attention and help with some customary photos. The restaurant has some nice photo ops both in and out - so definitely make full use of them.\n\nGiven that I wanted to try other stuff on the menu, I decided to drop by again. This time it was too cold to sit out and we still didn't have any reservations. We put our name on the waitlist and started thinking of ways to kill 90 mins. Another party was also waiting and so we decided to sit at the big table right upfront rattler than stand the entire time (be aware there is barely any waiting space inside). In a few minutes the hostess came up and told us that the party that has reserved the table was a no show and if we wanted to all sit together we could have the table. No more 90 min wait - hell yes, so we became best friends with the other group and started perusing the menu again on our phones. \n\nThis time around our sever was not as good. He took forever to greet us, or get us water. Then another decade to take our order. He didn't allow us to get any substations and was pretty grumpy all throughout. Guess what? - My coffee was cold AGAIN.  I guess they serve more cocktails than coffee ‍ to care. \n\nI ordered the shrimp and grits (and ARPITA B got the skillet). As I had mentioned the server did not want to make any accommodations for the potatoes in the skillet but ok! The food was yummy like the last time. The grits were creamy and soft, the shrimp and gravy was so flavorful. \n\nOverall, I will recommend this spot - make reservations ahead of time and definitely try and skillet and the strawberry shortcake French toast - you won't regret it.\n\nWhat's remaining for the next time - cocktails - they seem to have a bunch and they all sound good.",

It is definitely a good idea to go with a group. It's hard to choose one meal. We got chicken and waffles, salmon and grits, salmon patties and grits with a side of potatoes and eggs grits and bacon. Everything and I mean everything was great!  The chicken and waffles may have been my favorite but the grits and potatoes were really good also.

We looked and looked weeks in advance attempting to get a reservation, but was not able.  We walked in at 11 on Sunday and was quoted an hour and a half wait, we inquired about sitting at the bar, and a gentleman just happened to walk up.  He led us to excellent seats at the bar and then ended up being our bartender/server.  His name was Markus and he was amazing.  So attentive and nice.  Which was the complete vibe from everyone.  Everyone spoke and smiled and the employees seemed to genuinely be happy to be at work and like each other - which is not common imo.\n\nWe decided to split a bottle of champagne with juice and my friend did the Briscuit breakfast and I did the Hot Honey chicken.  Everything was delish.  Just a great experience overall.  Will definitely be back.",

        "text": "So...There was a lot going on during my first visit to Toast. First, I tried to walk into the other location at some point in time and was told there was no entry without a reservation even it it was to sit at the bar. This was a Saturday... So I'm thinking, D*mn... Their food must be bussin! So I made a reservation for this lo0cation and the next available was 2 weeks out... Once again... D*mn... Their food must be bussin! The day comes, my reservation is at 2pm, I get there at 2:09pm, the other part of my party was already there inside waiting for me so we could be seated. I tell the hostess I have a reservation at 2pm and the other half of my party is already here. She tells me to stand outside... So I repeat myself because maybe she didn't hear me... She repeats herself... So I ask her if she is telling me that y 2pm reservation is not ready for us to sit yet and she snaps back at me \"Well you didn't give me a name.\" Now Idk about you... but a neck roll turns up the attitude in me... So I snapped back \"I told you I had a 2pm and you didn't ask the name! and I proceeded to spell out my name as tensions got higher... ANYWHOO We were seated immediately (Because my 2pm was ready!) You have to know I already had my mind made up about what I wanted to eat. We sit down... The waiter tells us that they were out of Brussel sprouts, salmon, short rib, chicken, sprite, and some other drink... Now go look at there menu and see what's left... I came for the short rib and Brussel sprouts because I was on a no carb diet... don't ask it was a small cheat at this point... But it turned into him finding chicken and me getting three wings. My friend had to get the French toast (Which looked AMAZING) but was too much of a stretch from my diet for me to approve the decision for myself. The music was cool, there were bar seats available for people to come in and sit at in this location. and the waitress was attentive... BUT for the two week backup that you all have... Your manager that orders your supplies should be more accurate. The chicken I ate was good, I may try again, but right now its a no for me and overhyped.",

I started with the gumbo, which was a healthy portion with large pieces of broken-down crab. Soooo good. I had the hot honey chicken with yams and collard greens for lunch. So good, I want it for dinner too! The ambiance was a cool vibe. Very \"Atlanta\" chic and cool! Can't wait to go back!

        "text": "I've been here twice before however, my most recent visit (7.7.23) is what lead to this review. This restaurant seems to have completely changed or I simply overlooked the pricey in the past. \n\nPreviously, the GA Hot Honey Fried Chicken was a quarter or half chicken. I don't remember but I know it wasnt 3 wings. The change to the 3 wings wasn't the problem, but rather the price didn't decrease along with the portion size. There was even less collards and yams than before. I asked the server why the change and he said it was do to customers complaining about the size of the one wing on the previously served quarter/half chicken. It didn't make sense but okay, sure. I don't think the change is worth $27 (pic attached) \n\nNow, on to my biggest issue. The coercion from our server to manipulate his way into a larger tip. I hate I didn't pick up on it in the moment. We get our checks, he goes to my cousin first and she asked if the 18% was his tip included. He said no. He said it's a service fee that goes to the restaurant and divided amongst the different positions. However, the menu said 18% gratuity is included (I checked after we left). I reached out to the restaurant to get clarity on exactly who the 18% goes to. Our server went on to explain how he has to tip out the bar and bussers (which is normal, I've been a server before). He told us they are charged a $5 fee to work because the restaurant uses it to cover incidentals like breaking glasses. He said if a server chooses to get paid via direct deposit the restaurant charges a $3 fee for the transaction. \n\nMy cousin and I both gave an additional tip, based on all the info was telling us, but specifically that the 18% charge was not gratuity. As I previously stated, according to the menu it is. That's where the issue lies. \n\nOverall, I don't think it's worth the price any more. The staff was very kind but you can get a kind staff other places, with the same or better quality food for less. \n\nI seen in a other review someone mentioned valet being weird. It is lol but it's also complimentary.",

I didn't care how much that thang cost. I needed it in my life! And ya'll, when I tell you....the first bite made my eyes roll back in my head. Like, it was so decadent, it should have been criminal!

I asked for a mimosa and she asked which flavor or would I want her to make something. I said make something. I don't what flavor that was for my mimosa but it was REFRESHING!\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the chicken and waffles and omg was it excellent! The chicken was flavored and very tender. And the glaze and syrup on the waffles was everything. It was so good I thought about getting me a to go order lol. \n\nI will be back here and have already told friends this spot is a must!\n\nAnd a plus is that they do have valet but also pretty sizable parking lot with free parking.",

We were told we could stand over to the side and seat ourselves at the next table that becomes available. The hostess gestures over to a corner adjacent to the bar where 2 other parties were standing and waiting. There's no seating or waiting area over there. \n\nIt's obnoxious. \n\nWhy not take reservations? Why have a hostess if you're not going to seat people or time tables to keep the flow moving? \n\nWe didn't stay, of course. Maybe next ATL visit.",

I also ordered a mimosa which was well-made!\n\nParking: I was so scared to visit here because of the parking but the parking was plentiful, easy and free! I noticed complimentary valet but I didn't use it. Nevertheless, I parked on the hill and walked. Very short walk! \n\nService: A+ from the hostess to the bartender/server and runner!
