        "text": "In love Thai and Asian so we decided to try this place out. I was excited to go because the photos all looked amazing. Upon entering I was impressed by the interior design, it was amazing inside....And after getting our food and drinks I was also impressed by that however the service here was incredibly bad and very disappointing.\n\nWe ordered drinks as soon as we sat down and did not get them until AFTER our food was brought out. The food was brought to our table erratically and some people had their food almost ten minutes before others and the appetizer was brought after the main course. Our waitress did not check with us once on if we needed anything including another drink until it was time to pay. To me the success of a restaurant operates on the entire dining experience which includes service and the food quality but the service was nothing short of horrible. I'd love to return here in the future if there is a strong effort to improve their service but until then I won't be returning.",

I'm not sure if that was a usual occurrence as i was visiting from New Jersey. In any event, those who were in the restaurant enjoying their meals were well six feet from one another. \n\nI had a fried snapper and my lady had chicken curry but i cannot recall the specifics of it. In any event, we both enjoyed our meals here and said that this place would definitely be worth a revisit. I'm sure there are other places that serve Thai just as good or better but we do not deviate when we find good food. The ambience was definitely a plus here as well. It was sexy and intimate.",

I used to work at the large and tall building behind the restaurant (now with the salesforce sign) and would come over to the previous sushi spot, which was also pretty good. I love that they took over and expanded the space. Plenty of seating if you want to be away from the crowd in the main part of the restaurant with the bar. \n\nFood: I ordered the fried gyoza for appetizers and cobra sushi roll for my entree. Both were really good! I will say that the dipping sauce for the gyoza was not good.. very water with no taste. I also tried my friends shrimp pad Thai and it was also delicious! Thai food is my weakness, but I hadn't had sushi since March before all this COVID madness began so it was time for me to put Thai aside. Service wasn't fast and the staff were taking precautions by wearing masks and ensuring each patron was seated 6 feet apart from other patrons.\n\nDrinks: anything with Lychee is \n\nParking is easy with a few spots at the front and plenty on the side and behind the restaurant.",

I hate doing it but they're both Asian restaurants serving very similar foods and so when this one essentially took over I expected similar if not better. Their food is good. It's not bad at all but it's not amazing. Their sushi is decent. They do have some outdoor seating which is nice. The inside is very clean and spacious. I will say the service is excellent. It was never a service issue. Parking is free there is a parking lot. It's located very close to Lenox Mall and easy to get to. But I would just caution you and say the food is average and if you're expecting food equal to the restaurant that was there before you will be disappointed. It's a very nice atmosphere. Their martini was alright too. Their appetizers were pretty good including the dumplings. Again, great service, clean area, great location just three stars for the food which again was not bad at all but just not great. I was expecting more and my expectations were not met. That being said, I would come here again with friends to hang out as it does have a very nice atmosphere and I do like their appetizers.",

        "text": "I stopped in last week to try this place out and I'm so happy I did.  Let me start by saying the interior is beautiful.  On one side of the restaurant, there are these light fixtures that remind me of being in Thailand.  They are beautiful!  On the other side, there is a beautiful mosaic and a really nice bar.  It's a full stocked bar with plenty of seats.  The ambiance has a modern mixed with a kind of old school Thailand feel.  \n\nI started my meal off with the tom yum soup.  It was packed with amazing flavor.  Probably my most favorite of all the tom yum soups I have ever had in the states.  For my main course, I had the drunken noodles with beef.  I. Loved. It.  My husband had the massaman curry.  He ate all of it up.  He didn't spare a drop of the curry.  It was perfectly rich.  We finished the meal with the coconut cake.  I love the cake so much that I wish I could re-do my wedding just to have that as my wedding cake.  It's the best coconut cake I have EVER had.  \n\nThe service was wonderful.  Our server, Kota, was very attentive.  Not once was my water glass low and not once did we have to flag him down for anything.  He made the night that much more enjoyable. \n\nI think it's needless to say that I def recommend Silom. I can't wait to go back there again!  When I do, I'll be sure to take pics!",

        "text": "RIP Katana. I used to come eat at what used to be Katana every year for my birthday but sadly they have shut down.. \n\nI have been keeping up with Silom's social media posts and have been very excited to come eat here so when I finally had time to, I visited. \n\nI loved the way they did the interior. It was very pretty and very clean. The menu was not anything too extraordinary. My husband and I ordered the fried tofu, fried okra, the hangover roll and the lamb. I also ordered the Thai Tea cocktail. The tofu was okay, I really enjoyed the breading on the okra. The Hangover roll was alright but the lamb tasted great, especially with the sauce it came with, I believe it was a black pepper sauce. My cocktail didn't really have any Thai tea taste to it, I think the cream alcohol overpowered the tea. I was a bit disappointed with our dinner because  I didn't receive my cocktail until after all of our food came out and the server kind of disappeared on us. It was a busy night, I understand I have been a server before but we never got our waters refilled, even  right before and after getting our check when our server could see we had no water. I would return if someone invited me to and try something else but I don't think my husband and I would return for date night.",

Their menu is pretty limited compared to other Thai restaurants.\nI'd probably stick to Rain or Thaicoon down the street.\n\nI ordered shrimp pad Thai and my friend ordered chicken pad si ew.\nWhen our order came out- we both noticed that his pad si ew literally looked like they scrapped up the leftovers of multiple dishes and put it on his plate. The ingredients looked grinded/chewed up. He said the broccoli wasn't cooked all the way and the noodles tasted funny.\n\nMy pad thai did not taste like pad Thai at all. It was tasty but it definitely wasn't pad Thai haha. Lots of sauce and I don't think it was the regular noodles that is usually used for pad Thai either.\nIt tasted somewhere along the lines of lo mein / yakisoba.\n\nInteresting experience. I definitely won't be back for food. Maybe for their happy hour ??",

        "text": "This restaurant used to be Katana until they closed and a new ownership took over providing Thai and Japanese cuisine. The interior has new touches here and there so it felt like this was my first time sitting in this restaurant. My boyfriend and I went for a late lunch on a Sunday and there were only a few tables at the time with one server. He was able to greet us and have us seated quickly. \n\nWe started off with the seafood tomyum soup, which is a must get here! This is probably one of the best tomyum soups I've had in Atlanta, it's packed with a good amount of flavor and heat. Then, we ordered the lamb chops along with the sashimi (15 pieces) deluxe plate. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly in medium rare and marinated in a sweet sauce, we didn't even need to use the sauce that came with it. The veggies on the side helped balance off the plentiful protein we had. The sashimi plate had your typical fish- tuna, salmon, yellowtail -except the cuts were thick AND it was fresh! I could actually get full from this dish just by itself. Cocktails were good, I did not like the first one I ordered and my server noticed I wasn't drinking it. He was so sweet and switched it out for a lychee martini, which you can never go wrong with. Great service and delicious food, I plan on coming back!",

        "text": "Our reservation was at 7:30pm. Ordered our food at 7:45pm. There were five people in our group and the food came out two plates, then 12 minutes later, another. Then 21 minutes later another one and the last one came at 8:54pm. We order spicy food and we're thirsty; however we had to flag down a different waiter to get more water and then another server 30 minutes later for more water. We asked for the manager and I get there was a language barrier being a Thai restaurant. However, we ordered the hotpot and couldn't even get bowls for the soup. Took 35minutes. And yes I started tracking the time because it was ridiculous. People were getting their food well before we were. Wish there was a zero star for what we paid for the food. No effort to try to make it right or even come back and check on us. When they brought the last plate out, I asked what took so long and the waiter (not our original waiter) said they got a huge group in on the other aide of the restaurant. Which was a flat out lie because while I was waiting for our food, I went to the bathroom and saw there were only couples seated. The large group came in while I was coming out from the bathroom and that was just before the last plate  came out to the table. Very disappointed. Have eaten here before and was great! Sadly, they don't understand the value of damage control. And then they decided to give themselves a generous tip. I called the manager over and had him remove it. We gave the server 10% , as we were not trying to be ruthless. There are so many restaurants to eat at in Atlanta. Will be going somewhere else for Thai next time.",

We ordered:\n\nThai-foon\nBee's Knees\nKing of the Sea sushi rolls\nPad Thai\nTom Kha\nBeef appetizer(I don't know the name b/c the bf ordered it)\n\nThe cocktails tasted watered down like after you finish a drink and the ice has melted and you drink the rest, that's exactly how it taste\n\nTom Kha soup had the most flavor out of the dishes...but the chicken wasn't flavored and overcooked...like boiled chicken\n\nThe rest of the dishes were the same, lack of flavor...very dull to the tastebuds. Thai food is usually full of flavor from a bit tart to sweet, very gingerly, and spicy. \n\nOverall, the value is terrible...all of that cost close to $100 for dinner\n\nI recommend Tuk Tuk...as that's more authentic.",

Every person that worked there greeted with a smile. Our waitress went over the top and was awesome! We started with a couple of appetizers (fried okra, calamari, chicken satay) and I got a Thai Tea martini. All were very delicious and would highly recommend the fried okra. For my meal I ordered the Panang Curry with shrimp at medium level of spicy. It was the perfect amount of kick to enjoy my meal. Overall I was very pleased with my food and recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area. It is a brand new location that opened in November so give it some love!",
