        "text": "I tried to order delivery and it was disastrous. The website said to expect a wait time of 90 minutes - 2 hours as it was a busy night. For some reason, I thought that was reasonable even though my home is precisely 0.6 miles / 3 minutes away according to Google Maps. \n\nAfter 2 hours and 10 minutes, I called and they said the kitchen is finishing up, it'll be 25-30 minutes, and the manager would consider giving me a discount. 40 minutes later, approaching the 3 hour mark since I ordered, I called and they had a difficult time even finding my order. I genuinely don't think they even received it or were making it, meaning the previous employee made up what they told me. On the second call, I told them to cancel the whole thing and refund me as my family was hungry. I got no apology for their sloppiness. I enjoy their food but will not be returning. \n\nCompletely disorganized and 0 customer service or desire to correct their errors.",

        "text": "Upon walking into the Grand China restaurant for lunch, you see a unused bar (perhaps they only use it for dinner service). I was sat quickly and asked my preference on where I wanted to sit. The place smells like a musty bar, no scent of Chinese food when you walk in the door. I was greeted by the waitress and asked what I'd like to drink, I ordered the Japanese green tea. I order the Hunan beef with brown rice, after noticing that the usual Chinese items I would usually order are not on the lunch menu. I also ordered the wonton soup that is included with the meal. The soup was luke warm, the broth was tasty but the wontons were unusually thick and doughy and I had a hard time finding the meat. When my entree arrived, I immediately noticed, I did not get the brown rice I ordered but decided not to say anything as the waitress seemed busy. The dish itself again was just warm, not hot and some of the veggies were cold. The flavor was pretty bland, hardly any spice at all. Overall, I would not come back. I will give them points for playing Christmas music though.",

Husband had Spicy Thai beef and vegys and was not impressed, Much more salty than spicy. The drink prices were outrageous as well $13 and up.  We stuck with beer and wine, $11 for Kendall Jackson Chardonnay, felt like we were in NY or Miami.

But we had several kids and managed to squeeze an extra chair in. Waitress was very friendly and engaging and got our orders right away. I will comment that the menus were lacking - none of the Japanese items seen online were there. We were able to order some anyway (sushi chef out sick) but only because we looked in advance. It went downhill from there. 20mins for drinks. Another 10-15 for soup to arrive. Entrees came thereafter, scattered every 10-15mins. Then we waited for the check...I had to go ask for it twice. The food was great, and I realize it was day after holiday, but they were really suffering lack of staff. You have to shut off the delivery orders when the kitchen backs up and that didn't happen. Other tables waited and hour and got no food, leaving angrily and loudly. I would eat again with a normal party size on a normal night, but this was a huge failure in staffing.",

        "text": "\"What is happening? Everybody's supposed to be eating Chinese food.\" -- The Big Bang Theory: Season 11 | Episode 19\n\nI grew up coming to Grand China as a kid, not often, but often enough. I won't talk about just how long that has been, but let's just saw that this place is almost as old as I am...\n\nI brought my friends and neighbors here as they were craving quality Chinese food - they wanted a buffet. I explained that isn't usually quality. But if they wanted the good stuff, the best was in our back yard. We were quickly seated and our serve came by immediately. He was very attentive and made sure our drinks were never below half full.\n\nWe ordered a ton of food - so much, in fact, the server commented that we had ordered plenty. Never say this to a table - think wisely. We would have ordered more. Think leftovers! We started with the Egg Drop Soup and Steamed Veggie Dumplings - both winners and both evoked memories from my childhood. Everything came our hot and delicious.\n\nAs for entries, we had a hard time deciding. We opted for a variety of dishes and our server was good about letting me know what was safe for me to eat. Turns out everything was safe for my allergies. We chose:\nMu shu pork\nSliced roast pork\nGeneral Tso's chicken\nBeef ho fin\nGinger fried chicken\n\nThe guys decided on no seafood since I was at the table, even though I insisted it was fine. They decided we had picked enough stuff to enjoy. I will say that the Mu Shu was my Dad's favorite and I feel like it has not changed a bit. Building up those pancakes made me feel like a kid again. The two chicken dishes were both packed with flavor and really hit the spot, but I think thee beef was my favorite of the day - we didn't have any left to take home.\n\nWe packed up the rest of the leftovers, which was not too much, and were full and happy. Always a fabulous meal and glad to have them so close to home.",

The interior is very simply and very well decorated.  Lots of cool features and natural light.  The customer service was excellent.  Our waitress was fantastic and Ms. Chan came by multiple times to make sure that we were happy with the food and the drink.  She is responsible for all the recipes on the menu, both food and drink, and she was a delight to speak with as well.  My wife and I split the Szechuan soup dumplings, the sautéed boc choy, and the roasted duck.  I would highly recommend all three! Additionally, my wife got a pina colada, and was very impressed.  We will definitely be returning.  Be sure to check this place out!",

A general good/happy vibe in the dining room.  The wait staff was superb - our water glasses were never less than half full!  This was my first ever visit - and I did my research.  I had been watching YouTube videos on Asian cooking - and was dying for wok prepared entrees. We had the fried pork dumplings and sizzling rice soup as our appetizers.  The fried dumplings were not the best I've had.  Certainly not terrible - just a little doughy and the pork filling wasn't my favorite.   But the sizzling rice soup was very good.  The House Fried Rice was excellent.  But the General Tso's Chicken (requested extra spicy) was the best I've ever had!  When you have breaded chicken at an average Chinese restaurant - it never really tastes right.  A truly experienced chef and a blazingly hot wok are indispensable.  My General Tso's chicken arrived piping hot!  The white rice was fresh and hot and sticky - just like you'd expect from a premier Chinese restaurant.  They were incredibly generous with the sauce.  The sauce was incredibly sweet but that flavor was cut with vinegar and spiciness.  But the key was the breading!  The breading was perfectly crispy - which is make or break for Chinese cuisine. This dish brought back memories (I didn't know I had).  I can assure you I'll be back.  This is a world class Chinese restaurant with very talented chefs who make entrees with love.  I wish I could go in the kitchen and watch them cook for 60-minutes to get ideas for the next entree I want to try!",

More like salty water. No lemon grass. No coconut. No cilantro. Lots of mushrooms and over boiled chicken. The dumplings were gummy and just bad. This was the worst Chinese I've had in Atlanta.
