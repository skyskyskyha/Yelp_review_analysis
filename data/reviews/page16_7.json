        "text": "This is by far my favorite Japanese restaurant in Atlanta! Incredible food and two distinct atmospheres for dine-in. One side is a lively hibachi grill and the other is a quiet, sexy, sushi bar / dining room. We also order takeout all the time and it's just as good and well presented. Chateaubriand filet in hibachi is phenomenal, as is the teriyaki chicken and shrimp/lobster. Worth the money every time; generous portions. Experienced and creative sushi chefs with signature roles. Family owned for almost 50 years, they even send personal thank you notes with takeout sometimes. Highly recommend, for special occasions or anytime you want to splurge. Very good food & people!",

Our regular spot is Benihana's but visited Nakato since the downtown location was shut down. We ordered the Astro Boy flavored fishbowl which was really good. We're pretty frequent drinkers though so between the both of us it was like having one strong drink. \nFor our entrees I ordered the teriyaki chicken with fried rice. He ordered the shrimp and chicken. Honestly my favorite part of the meal were the garlic noodles and shrimp. The service was good as well. I definitely would visit again!",

        "text": "Came here for someone's birthday. Great valet service. The waiter was friendly taking everyone's orders. I told him I do not eat meat only seafood.  Someone in my party ordered sake and loved it! Everyone was having a good time at the table until we realized a party that came in after us was already having their meal cooked front of them and a party who was seated less than 10 minutes prior was having their salads. We brought this to the attention of our waiter and then a manager. They quickly got a chef out to cook for us. The manager even confirmed the arrival time each party. \n\nOur chef didn't have all of the enthusiasm as the other chefs but perhaps he was tired. We enjoyed him non the less. After cooking the meal the chef was trying to be nice by giving me some of the left over chicken. It was already on my plate before I could stop him. \nOnce he realized his mistake and that picking it out wasn't an option he made my entire meal over. This was real service to me!  \nThey also sang to the birthday girl in our party.\n\nThe next time I comeback I'll try one of the tables with seats on the floor next time.",

The service was great and the drinks were tasty. I gave them 4 stars for a few reason. The noodles were different so when we asked our cook what type of noodles they were his response was that he didn't know. Um, sir, as the cook I'm going to need you to be well versed in what you're serving. \n\nSecondly, the hibachi room that we were in was kinda dirty and the carpet that we had to place our feet on was kind of creepy and dark. They should probably consider putting down hardwood.\n\nOverall it was a good time and food.",

I ordered the shrimp and scallops hibachi dinner both times. I've also had the chicken skewers, dumplings and a sushi roll! \n\nThough I can't recall the sushi roll name I remember it being small! I mean really small but flavorful! Like one of the best sushi rolls I've ever had. The chicken skewers were small pieces of chicken for the price but they were also delicious! I liked that the shrimp dumplings were soft and filling and the sauce that came with them was good. As for the miso soup and salad with ginger dressing, there were standard as far as any hibachi restaurant goes but still flavorful with fresh ingredients! The shrimp and scallops dinner was a lot! My friend and I shared everything and we still had leftovers. The shrimp were plump the shrimp fried rice was done right and I loved how large and sweet the scallops were! \n\nThe service was simple so I can't say much on that being that one order was Uber eats and the other was curbside. So no complaints there. I would definitely say Nakatos is far better than Benihana'a! So go and enjoy!! \n\nHighly recommend!",

        "text": "I have been here a few times in the last 10 years but have not been here in about 4 years.  I thought my experience would have been like the other times but overall I was disappointed. \nWe booked on open table and had a reservation. Once we arrived we still had to wait 30 minutes past the reservation time to sit at Hibachi. We later found out the restaurant canceled out open table reservation. \n\nOnce seated, I ordered the steak (medium rare) and lobster.  The fiancé ordered the filet and shrimp with white rice.  The hibachi chef was funny and entertaining. \n\nWhile cooking all our meals, he must have misjudged the amount of filet to be served because he forgot my fiancé.  I noticed he asked a server to bring another filet, which he started cooking about half way through.  The fiancé finally received her steak about 15 minutes after everyone else got theirs.  She also had to ask the chef like 3 times for the white rice she ordered.  He just kept saying yes it's coming. We finally asked the waitress and she brought it. \n\nMy meal (steak and lobster): the steak was cooked to medium well, even though I ordered medium rare.  I noticed he took off the steak of someone sitting next to me about 4 minutes before mine.  The steak was just ok (would have been better if it was the right temp).  \nThe lobster was cooked well.  The problem was of the 8 pieces, 4 of them still had shells attached.  Nothing like paying for lobster and biting into crunchy pieces. \n\nHighly disappointed in the service and overall atmosphere in this place. This used to be a go to but they definitely failed in numerous areas.",

I don't like how they charge extra for fried rice because of course you're at hibachi for the fried rice but whatever. The food is good though and I love how they add the noodles.

        "text": "I recently had the opportunity to dine at Nakato Japanese restaurant. I love that they're celebrating a milestone anniversary in the Atlanta area and for good reason. The food is delicious and the restaurant itself is so very unique.\n\nI had no idea that Nakato boasts four types of dining at their restaurant. They have traditional style Japanese dining, a sushi bar, a Hibatchi Teppanyaki grill AND the most awesome Tatami Rooms! \n\nA Tatami Room is a traditional Japanese tea room and it is unlike any other dining experience in Atlanta. The Tatami room experience is beyond anything you can imagine. It's a wonderful journey in Japanese culture. When entering the room we were asked to remove our shoes. I was wearing espadrille heels and was fairly thrilled with the request. We were seated on the floor on ultra comfortable seats and cushions. The atmosphere was reminiscent of a relaxing spa day, but with exceptional food and drink.\n\nOur first taste of Nakato's grand menu was an aperitif of shiso shochu served in beautiful blue and gold glasses. The shiso shochu was accented with shimmering gold flecks in the beverage and was divinely delicious. After came dish after stunningly beautiful dish of King Crab Salad with Apple Vinegar, and the Five Point appetizer which included spectacular five point appetizer which included \"miso\" grilled black cod, slow cooked \"tsubugai\" sea whelk, salmon terrine, fried \"kawaebi\" river shrimp and \"sera mame\" broad bean. \n\nThat was followed by traditional savory custard \"chawanmushi\", then miso grilled eggplant, tempura and yakitori skewers. Chef Kinjo then brought out a stunning array of fresh sushi options, the finally dessert. \n\nIf you're looking for the most spectacular, unique meal in Atlanta, this is exactly what you're looking for.",

We also got the sashimi plate. We got 6 different type of fish that all tasted fresh. \n\nFor the main entree, we got the seafood hotpot. They already prepared the ingredients in the pot before they bring it to the table. Ready to eat. The seafood included crab legs, shrimp, scallops, couple of mussels, squid, some type of white fish. Tofu, cabbage, carrots, and onions completed the pot.  The flavors were all there, though I wished for more clams and mussels in the soup. \n\nMatcha creme brulee and ice cream completed this night of great food. \n\nThe servers were super nice and attentive. Some were wearing kimonos which is a nice touch.",

We strongly suggest making reservations as we do tend to get quite busy.\n\nSince we opened in 1972, we have prided ourselves on bringing the traditions and culture of Japan for people to experience and enjoy in Atlanta. We apologize that you did not care for it, and hope you make a reservation for your next visit, and enjoy another area of our restaurant.  Warm Regards and Happy Holidays!\n\nSincerely,\nSachi Nakato and Restaurant Staff",

        "text": "I want to start by saying I feel that nakato is was one the best hibachi restaurants ITP, but my experience this past Friday was less than ideal. I feel like Friday is a busy day for them and it showed with the valet. Cars were lined up almost into the street and it seemed like they didn't have enough valet workers to move the cars at a decent pace. \n\nWe had a reservation for 830PM and my party was all there on time. We weren't sat until 9PM. Our server Jackson was really nice! He brought the birthday person several sake shots. Our chef on the other hand wasn't as lively. We expected a great hibachi experience especially with it being a birthday but I definitely feel like it was rushed. \n\nThe sushi rolls we ordered were really great! It took them a while to come out but they were really great and fresh! Our chef however overlooked my steak I believe. I know I ordered the regular sirloin but it was so thin and tough. I should've paid the extra $10 for filet mignon. Everything else was decent but slightly over cooked. I hope upon my next return I experience better quality in the future as it is one of my favorite spots!",

Last time I had sukiyaki in New York the waiter continuously came back to check on the pot with a full room of people. Today the restaurant is almost empty and the waiter still managed to just go MIA and left me clueless with the pot. There was no water given, which caused the sukiyaki sauce to quickly decay into a burning matter, and it took me so many times to actually get the waiters attention to go and get some water. \nWhen I left the restaurant I left a complaint at the front desk. However the lady was not really giving any response, which just made the whole experience worse.\nLast time I was here there was actually a good experience. This is no offense but garbage. \nI don't usually complain about things but I'm just really sad about the whole experience. This is my birthday meal and I couldn't even finish the meal because of how burnt the whole thing tasted.  I left with more than half of the food untouched.\nI got the agedashi tofu, which was fine. The sukiyaki and the service really let me down. I would not come back to this restaurant and I advice others to not go. I'm usually a generous tipper but this experience was so bad I didn't want to tip at all. I ended up giving something like a dollar and I am still thinking it was not worth it. If I can I would give this restaurant no stars at all.",

I was so excited to see what will come out next. The pacing of bringing the food out was just right.\n\nSeafood roll. Yes, it was a WHOLE roll with 8 pieces. It was generous with different types of seafood.\n\nSpicy yellowtail roll. It was adequately and satisfactory spicy. This is good value.\n\nGoma ae. Eating healthy feels and tastes good. There was a generous amount of spinach.\n\nSeared white tuna. Nothing to write home about.\n\nSalmon skin salad. The ginger dressing is separate so you are in control of how much you put in your salad. Salmon skin was scarce but good. This salad was fresh and the salmon skin was the cherry on top.\n\nGyoza. Very good. Skin has the right amount of chewy consistency.\n\nSlowly cooked pork. It was a bit dry but roll it around the sauce for maximum flavor.\n\nPanko shrimp. It was done right.\n\nUme shiso roll. Even though the overwhelming (plum?) flavor was too much for me, I was still distracted by the fishy seaweed paper. I don't know how this can be improved.\n\nCalamari tempura. It was ok.\n\nI sipped on the cocktails and both tasted like medicine to my amateur drinking taste buds.\n\nService is friendly and competent.\n\nFree parking is on the Piedmont side of the restaurant but there's valet parking on the Chesire Bridge side, too.",

Most people were waiting to be seated at the teppanyaki side so we were seated immediately since we just wanted the regular stuff.\n\nYou should check in on yelp and get BOGO sushi roll!! You can do either a specialty sushi roll with a regular roll or two regular rolls. I ended getting the specialty roll with soft shelled crab and the rainbow roll. We also ordered the Chirashi. Everything was great! The chirashi comes out super pretty and there's two pieces of almost everything (eel, salmon, tuna, egg, etc.) so it's good for sharing between two people. The staff here were friendly and food was decent. Hope to come back here again!",

The steak was not seasoned AT ALL and was severely overcooked (I ordered medium and each piece seemed to be varying levels of well done to unchewable). I am trying to contact Uber eats in regards to getting a refund. Their rice also had no flavor. I don't know if this is because I did not sit down at the grill, but this was so disappointing. I don't recommend eating here. I also ordered right when they opened, so I do not see an excuse for them being busy.",

We do use only the absolutely finest ingredients, as a family-owed business it's important to us to maintain a level of high quality for our guests.  That's why our dishes cost a bit more.  \n\nWe do hope you will order again from us and give another opportunity to wow you with the wonderful, authentic Japanese dishes we have become known for. \n We are always happy to make suggestions to you in the future.

A day of reservation on OpenTable offered late dining options, so I called the restaurant and they fit us in at an earlier time for the sushi side of the house. Complimentary valet and nice touches from the start...\"enjoy your meal\" he says before driving off with my car. We're guided to a spacious table near the window and settle in to the dimly lit dining room. The atmosphere was tranquil with the occasional birthday celebration and song.\n\nI can eat tofu all ways. Agedashi tofu to start, lightly fried with ground radish and scallions in a tempura sauce. Next up: Dragon Roll (amaebi or shrimp tempura on the inside and eel/sauce on the outside) and a White Kelp Roll (soft shell crab inside covered in white kelp). Gentle and fresh flavors with both rolls, and don't overlook the fried shrimp heads on the plate. Crunch Crunch. My friend rounded out her meal with Chilean sea bass and mushrooms in a seaweed broth with ponzu sauce, served mini hot pot style over a flame. Hot Tea, Wine and a BOGO sushi offer on yelp. \n\nGood night, guaranteed return.",

Now back to food and drinks. The Tokyo Tea is a must! Do not be fooled by the \"tea\" cause the drink will hit you. The food was tasty, well prepared, the presentation of the plating was perfection. I ambiance is dim and romantic. The service is topnotch. We never had to ask for our glasses to be refilled or plates to be removed.

        "text": "This place is never not a good time. If you don't know, Nakato is a hibachi restaurant, so you literally see your food cooked in front of you. They place you in rooms, Japanese style, meaning no shoes, so make sure your socks match amongst other things to not embarrass yourself. Also they will sit you side by side with other people outside your party so be prepared for that.\n\nUpon getting there, there is complimentary valet and inside is pretty peaceful. It's not too loud but it sounds populated. I never had a drink from here but the food is amazing but pricey so prepare to spend some cash.\n\nEverytime I come I order the calamari steak, which is basically calamari chopped up into cubes. It's delicious. I eat it with fried rice and yum yum sauce. These meals all come with mushroom soup, and a iceberg lettuce salad with some strange brown sauce on it. It's not bad but it's a bit different. I recommend trying it first to see if you like it. I can definitely see someone not liking it. \n\nAs for the waiter service, impeccable. They are very attentive and are always looking out for your needs. As for the overall experience, it is pretty cool. You'll get the onion volcano, the spinning eggs and fire flares. Just be prepared because somehow I always get caught off guard when the fire part starts.\n\nLastly for the checks, PAY ATTENTION. They add their gratuity in them already for you. I don't go often but I always forget and tip extra. Which isn't bad but I gotta keep a budget and still tip the drivers. Overall it is definitely a good restaurant to experience. This place definitely has my seal of approval.",

The sushi is fresh, the service is accommodating and friendly, and the overall price point is excellent. I ordered a rainbow roll and some sashimi which was reduced nicely by the bogo checkin option yelp offers here! Hari (spelling?) was an excellent server and she offered sake ordering advice that was on point.\n\nThe noise here is not bad but I assume if you are at a hibatchi table it will be noisier than average. \n\nI'm ready to take on the evening on a full stomach! Also they will give a receipt and let you carry out the sake bottle if you don't finish!",

We were first served soup that was cool, Luke warm at best. Sent it back to be heated. Then we had sushi, the rice was mushy and flavorless, had the same type of taste as some type of supermarket sushi. Not good. We noticed part of the grill was cooking food too fast. The fried rice taste burnt, so I ended up opting for steamed...which was ok. The food all taste oily, lack of seasoning and just plain bland.
