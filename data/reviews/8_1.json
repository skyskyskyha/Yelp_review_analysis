I tried the egg dish, grouper, and chocolate passion fruit dessert. I forgot the name of other things but my food was good. I'd return for the experience.

        "text": "This place blew my taste buds away! Here's how the night went: \n\nWe were seated out in the patio by an attentive front of house staff. The temperate and ambiance were Americana and everyone was covid safe. My partner ended up having 2 glasses of their house Sauvignon Blanc  and it was great! I had the Miller Thyme which is a lemon, thyme and house gin drink that was fantastic. Their drink menu is extensive and you can get almost anything at any price point. I finished the night with a McAllen 12.\n\nOur waiter was incredible and attentive. They were great with recommendations. We started off with the Charcuterie and Cheese board. While $34 for a board seems steep, I was impressed with the selection and the quantity. I would go back just for drinks and a board. We also had some bread and butter, let me tell you, this butter was sweet and savory with a hint of either honey or molasses.\n\nFor our entrees my partner had the steak dinner. It was cooked perfectly with potato's arugula, spinach and cream sauce. To me the best part of this dish was the asparagus. \n\nBut the real show comes with my dish. I got the quail. This was recommended by the waiter. This was hands down one of the most exquisite dishes I have ever tasted. The dish came with 2 perfectly seasoned and cooked quails. Radish, beets, and strawberries underneath. Just WOW! This place really has an emphasis on the quality of local organic food. Every bite was like an adventure. \n\nWe needed the night with two desserts. We had a fantastic chocolate mouse that was paired perfectly with a passion fruit gel. For the second dessert we had the recommended meyer lemon semifreddo. It was a perfect mixture of sweet and tart, and capped the night off perfectly.\n\nThis place may run your bill up, but don't worry it's and experience you won't want to miss out on. I'm excited to see the seasonal menu shift and try out what they're cooking up next!",

I had an angels envy and it was good as expected. I have a garlic allergy and our waiter Princeton was very professional and made sure to point out to me the items that I could and could not have which was very helpful when our group got a large number of appetizers and he pointed out which ones I could and could not have. My entree was a fish that now I cannot remember but it was excellent. Princeton was outstanding and I wish more waiters were as professional and thoughtful as he was. Keep up the great work!!",

        "text": "Writing this quicker and on the fly, as I might not remember details as the night progresses. First let me say it is depressing that I'm here and the high temp is like 40 degrees. Although it is comfortable coming from the freezing conditions from up north. Psychologically it does make this being a 24 hour trip more bearable. It would be murder on me of it was in the 70s.\n\nWalking into this spot, I was intrigued by the layout. It definitely falls into the farmhouse chic look. The layout of the tables was super curious as they didn't seems to follow any patterns but overall the feel I got from it was cozy. I was expecting hearty, warm comfort foods but what ended up on my plates was so much more. \n\nChilled at the bar with an Old Fashioned while I waited for my table to prepared. Must have been thirsty cause that one went down pretty quick... oops. The bartender recommended the Southern Son, a drink made with 12 year old bourbon and vanilla bitters. Sounds crazy but my goodness I would fly back to enjoy one of those again. \n\nNow to the food. I started with the farm egg in the celery cream. Never having celery cream before I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was pretty straight forward. It was like a cream of celery with an egg cracked in it. Now I know what you're thinking, what??? This might have been my favorite dish out of several favorite dishes for the night.\n\nThe main course was the brisket. I really wanted something southern, something warming and filling. I thought maybe a fried chicken would be on the menu, especially when you first walk in, the look and feel just made me feel like it would some delicious chicken, but this sounded just as belly warming. It was perfectly cooked with polenta and I ordered a side of veggies to go with it. I can't remember having such a tender brisket in a very long time. \n\nTo finish the night I ordered the orange cake and coffee. Now everyone at this point knows how much of a sweet tooth I have, and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this one either. \n\nThe service was nothing short of spectacular, the atmosphere welcoming and the experience glorious. I can't recommend this enough and look forward to my next visit.",

        "text": "This rating is really hard for me. The food was done well, and I liked it, but it didn't blow me away. The service was perfect, but not at all friendly.  The hostess barely acknowledged my presence. I don't know if it was me, the hipsters that work here, if I hyped it up too much in my mind, or what. \n\nI was really excited for Miller Union. The menu looked great and the restaurant has rave reviews. Note the menu is limited, and I had been hoping for something in addition to the posted menu, but I arrived to find no specials. No worries. \n\nI started with a Southern Son (bourbon, house vanilla bitters, maple shrub) to drink. It was potent and delicious and one of the better cocktails I've had recently. My starter, a whipped feta with flatbread crackers and vegetables was light and creamy. I practically licked the dish--it was that good. Really simple, but really flavorful. My entree was the quail. I'm a huge quail fan. The quail was tender and juicy, and the accompanying vegetables were perfectly cooked. Presentation for everything was beautiful.\n\nI felt like I was either a burden to the staff or that I did not belong. I couldn't tell which, or maybe it was both. Maybe my spend didn't warrant them being friendly. It was a super uncomfortable experience for me, and I almost left after my drink and starter. I did choose to go somewhere else for a nightcap and dessert, because I just couldn't stay any longer.\n\nThis is one of the few restaurants that I would return to, despite not having the best experience. I really, really want to like Miller Union.",

        "text": "Amazing! \n\nI was in Atlanta for a weekend and my goal was to eat as much Southern food as my stomach would allow. I came here for lunch after reading numerous glowing reviews about this place. My meal exceeded all of my expectations.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Pimento cheese and cornmeal hoecakes ($8) - these were phenomenal and probably my bf's favorite. The pimento cheese had an amazingly tangy flavor that contrasted so well with the heartiness of the hoecakes. We buy a lot of pimento cheese from Murray's Cheese but the pimento cheese we had here is so much better.\n\n- Field green & boiled peanut salad ($12) - this came highly recommended by our waiter and while it was pretty good, it was overshadowed by the hoecakes and the quail. With the amount of legumes in this dish, it's quite filling for a salad (though it does run afoul of the lectin-free GOOP diet, if that's your thing).\n\n- Peach & bourbon glazed quail ($15) -  this dish was a revelation for me. The first thing that hits you is the mouthwatering aromas, which I could smell even before the plate was placed in front of me, causing even my vegetarian boyfriend to make googly ones at the quail. The peach & bourbon glaze was fantastic and rendered the skin just the slight amount of crisp. The quail was perfectly cooked and was served on top of a delicious bed of farro, celery, peach and pecan puree. A true celebration of Southern ingredients and flavors.\n\nIn addition to the amazing food, our experience here was made even better by our attentive waiter. He was super helpful in guiding us through the menu, telling us what he personally liked and also generally being a good conversationalist. If I ever find myself in Atlanta again, I would definitely come back.",

And since it's been open for 10 years and has received commendations galore, you can pretty much count on it being around when you need it and acting as a foolproof option.\n\nOn my most recent visit, I came for lunch and was content with my burger ($14) and the notorious ice cream sandwich ($6). The only slight bobble was that my medium burger had been unintentionally swapped with my companion's medium rare burger. The burger is a traditional one but done very well, with a slab of white cheddar and thinly sliced red onions along with lettuce and tomato, all captured in a toasted sesame bun. We couldn't get enough of the ketchup that came with the crispy fries, needed more fries too! \n\nThe exclusive-to-lunch ice cream sandwiches deserve their own paragraph. We actually were oohing and aahing about the cookie components more than the ice cream. They needed to be thicker! The ice cream was high-quality too; blackberry swirl and pecan toffee in vanilla bases were the day's selections. Fantastic.\n\nService is always warm and attentive, never snooty. There's complimentary valet in the lot right in front of Miller Union and also non-free street parking. Reservations can be made on Resy.",

The taste was good, but it was fairly small...could not have been over 6oz. Best dishes, by far, were the mutliple  desserts shared by the table.\n\nService was terrible and absolutely inexcusable given the amount of money spent. On the food, we waited well over 45 minutes between ordering the main course and receiving it. Drinks took forever and many of us sat with empty drinks multiple times. I ended up asking three times for one drink over the course of 30+ minutes. Dessert drinks came out when dessert was almost finished, and one person didn't even get theirs.\n\nHopefully others have a better experience, especially with the service, but this was our first and last time here.",

        "text": "I've been meaning to try this joint for a long, long time. Apparently warehouse dining is the crave these days, so what's better than aimlessly following a latest trend without questioning? Fine, in all fairness, I do have respect for many designers capable of turning a warehouse into a hospitable sometimes even cozy establishment.\n\nPart I: Local, Organic and Farm to Table\nI like this concept and it's the heart and soul of this establishment. Steven Satterfield has a strong aim to use Georgia or surrounding state ingredients to make cuisine local and seasonal.\n\nPart II: Salty Salty\nI couldn't have left here without trying their famous rabbit. The preparation was fine, although in my taste pretty boring. The rabbit meat itself was average in quality and has a long way to go compared to many rabbits I've tried from farmers. The preparation was simple, something you could easily make at home without much effort. I wish they brought some bread to finish up the sauce that came with the rabbit, I ended up having to leave it. The worst part about rabbit and scallops dishes was the amount of salt, both were quite over salted. Scallops also had a very fishy smell to them that I wasn't a big fan of. It truly bothers me when restaurants over salt food...if someone wants more salt, they'll add it. Portion size was small, especially for the hefty price they charge. None of the food was worth making a return visit, but in all fairness was not bad either.\n\nPart III: The Booze and the Vibes\nWines are priced fairly here. Most bottles on the lower end of spectrum are about twice the store price and higher end ones get a smaller upcharge. The ambiance is minimalistic. Service was wonderful. Frankly, this establishment did not do much wrong, other than oversalting the food, but for the price, it was just a bit boring from the food to the design. In other words, a well deserved 3 stars.",

The menu is simple, yet very flavourful food. I had the chicken and the steak and both were absolutely delicious. For dessert, if you enjoy a dessert that's a little less sweet, go for the Cornbread Cake. The right mix of sweet and savoury to end a wonderful dinner. \n\nI must say, my favourite part of this restaurant is...the wine list! Oh my goodness, this wine list is not to be missed! So many benchmark producers at prices that won't break the bank. I'll forever remember having my first taste of JL Chave Saint-Joseph here. \n\nThis restaurant is a must try here in Atlanta!",

They had a good wine list and I got to taste a couple of French wines from areas I visited recently so that was fun.\n\nAs a side, we shared the cornmeal fried okra. It was crunchy and gooey, as fried okra should be and it was delicious. They were out of the lamb meatballs, so we got a different kind of lamb appetizer. The meat was cooked perfectly and juicy. For entree, I ordered the littleneck clams & pork sausage, which also came with: fish collar, basil farfalle, tomato, fennel, leek. It was a lovely dish with plenty of clams. It tasted fresh and all items combined well together.",

        "text": "Wow. What an amazing experience. I am not young or hip or gorgeous, just an ordinary girl from Minnesota. Still, I did want to check this out and it was a perfect experience in every way. Absolutely perfect from start to finish from the servers to the chef.\n\nParty of 4 wanting one amazing meal and we got it. All the appetizers looked so good that we decided we would order all, or most, of them and we were not disappointed. Highlights were the butter bean hummus and homemade lavash (fresh and so delightful!), The farm egg in celery cream (signature dish not to be missed! OMG, creamy and damn amazing), Scallops barely cooked, crisp on the outside, served with a bit of pumpkin puree, apple and fennel (couldn't be more perfect), roasted oysters (simply a taste of the sea enhanced with a bit of smoked oyster cream and a little ham.oh, yes, you want this), and there's more.\n\nBut wait, let me tell you their cocktails are top notch. I had the Southern Son, a delicious concoction of bourbon, vanilla bitters and Maple syrup (like tasting fall and spring at the same time making you nostalgic for both seasons.) And the Evergreen (a beautiful cocktail bringing all scents to your nose in great balance)\n\nLastly, to end our meal, a delicious caramel pecan tart served with a Mandarin sorbet and think Ginger snaps. Done to perfection.\n\nLove this place so much we bought the cookbook. I am going to be in heaven a little longer.",

Dark chicken roasted was perfectly seasoned and crispy. The pork shoulder meat was literally so tender that it would separate so easily without a knife. However, the pork was salty or it could have been the side of vegetables. Overall, our meal at Miller Union was good. Highly recommend trying however, expect to pay at least $70 for main dish and appetizers for two excluding drinks and tip.",

The Farro Salad with Beets was bland, as was the Egg in Celery Cream (which should have come with more than 4 halves of toasted bread). Likewise with the Quail, which was good but rather listless and one dimensional. The kitchen seems shy of garlic and spices.\nWe shared one desert, a Blueberry Tart with a shortbread crust. It was not a tart, just a tart shell filled with fresh blueberries (topped with a small scoop of delicious honey-lavender sorbet), and the crust was too thick(!) to break with the provided spoons.\nThe cocktails and wines by the glass start at $14. The wine list is extensive but very pricey.\nOur server was delightful, but not well trained, which is the responsibility of management. \nNo reason to return, for there are other fish in the sea.",

        "text": "Was in the Atlanta area for a work conference and decided to come here for dinner. Really nervous since it was my turn to pick dinner and my manager is a huuuuge foodie. We weren't sure what to expect, since we were a group from NY but we were very impressed by the quality, the service, and price of this place. A noteworthy mention is that they have an exquisite wine list. \n\nWe were able to make same day reservations for dinner on a Thursday. Just an fyi but they will charge a $25 per person if you don't make adjustments 24 hours prior. Not sure if there was a formal dress code but all the diners looked classy.\n\nFor starters we got the grit fritters, the tahini hummus, and the feta dip. I think the grit fritters were the most memorable out of the 3. For the main entree most of the group decided to go with what our waiter recommended which was the lamb (pictured). I wasn't expecting it to come in a broth but that was probably my favorite part! The meat was fall off the bone tender and the gnocchi that came with it was gently pan seared. \n\nFor dessert we got the chocolate flan, the sweet potato bread pudding, and the rhubarb streusel. All were amazing! If I had to pick one, I would recommend the sweet potato bread pudding. \n\nThis would definitely be the first place I come back to if I were to visit Atlanta again. \n\nTL,DR: This is a very very nice place that will serve you amazing food and wine. It was an overall wonderful experience. This is worthy of an anniversary, proposal, or other special occasion dinner.",

        "text": "Came on a Thursday night with a good friend visiting. This place leaves something to be desired in my opinion... \n\nFOOD: For an appetizer, we shared the hummus appetizer because it was recommended in reviews my friend saw. It wasn't noteworthy at all. Needed more flavor and more things to dip! Like bell peppers would be a good addition. For mains, my friend and I shared: we got grilled pork loin ($24) and the lamb shoulder ($27), and also shared a side of brussels sprouts ($8). I thought the pork loin was better than the shoulder -- it had a very interesting \"maple red eye\" coffee sauce that I think worked nicely. The shoulder was okay, but wouldn't order again (especially for $27!). Flavors just didn't work quite well with each other in my opinion -- nothing stood out to bring the whole dish together. I also thought the brussels sprouts should have been crispier and better seasoned. I feel like I make my own brussels sprouts better, which is never a good sign when you're just a slightly above average cook. \n\nDESSERT: We shared the pan baked brownie with ice cream. Honestly I was disappointed. The brownie tasted too sweet -- like add vegetable oil and water boxed brownie sort of thing. I know this sounds harsh but I'm really big on dessert and I expected something better than this :( \n\nSERVICE: Good! Friendly server, no complaints except they took one of out plates away before the other was done (I think that's rude because it makes the other person feel rushed). \n\nAMBIANCE: Nice, a bit upscale. Tablecloths and booths sorta place. Could use a bit more style -- seems a bit cookie cutter in my opinion. \n\nVALUE: Meh. Qualms here -- I wasn't all that impressed with my food, especially considering what I paid. \n\nOVERALL: Decent restaurant, but a bit pricey for the food. Not sure if I just didn't order the right things, but I wouldn't recommend this place.",

        "text": "I was traveling to Atlanta for work and decided to try Miller Union out after reading about it, and I'm glad I did. I came in on a Wednesday night and sat at the bar, where they serve the full menu. The bar was pretty empty but the dining area, which is segregated off, seemed lively. The bartender was an absolute pleasure to interact with. The drink menu is full of craft cocktails and extensive wine options. I started off with a strawberry gin drink which was fruity and refreshing. \n\nI ordered food based on the bartender's recommendation, which he provided with confidence. I love when servers are knowledgable and opinionated about their menu, which he certainly was. I started with their famous egg in celery cream which was flavorful and unique. The salty, savory, creamy mixture is delicious when sopped up with the toasted bread and manages to be delicate yet full of depth.\n\nNext I got the Captain Chicken. I pretty much have a rule that I don't order chicken when I go out, I typically find it to be overcooked and one of the more boring choices on the menu. I told the server this but he ensured me I HAD to order it. And wow. This is no ordinary chicken. First off, you're getting multiple parts of the chicken, still on the bone, and cooked to perfection (even the breast!). And then the flavors and textures its cooked with bring it over the top. It has a rich tangy tomato sauce, crunchy peanuts that add perfect texture with the rice, and crispy flakes that add even another element. This is a dish I would come back for.\n\nThroughout the whole experience, the bartender was so friendly and accommodating, he made me feel right at home. He even reccomended things to do in the local area that ended up being great! This place is definitely not cheap but for the food and service, its worth it.",

        "text": "The restaurant is located in West Midtown area and serves southern new American food using fresh farm ingredients.\n\nThe restaurant itself has great ambience: nice soft music playing on the background, and the entire restaurant, which is actually large, is broken down into several smaller areas, which allows for a cozy yet chic feel. Needless to say the staff is very welcoming and friendly, the southern friendly. \n\nThe menu wasn't extensive, but all the dishes seemed very unique in its own way making you want to try everything. For the appetizer, I went with the Farm Egg baked in celery cream with grilled bread, and I think I did a great choice. I was worried a bit about the celery cream because I'm not a fan of celery, but I didn't taste it much; what I tasted was a creamy yet light, rich flavor with a hint of tender sweetness.\nMy choice of main course was the Grilled Quail with beets, spinach, vidalia (first time I heard this word and it stands for a type of sweet onions), strawberries and spring onion soubise (basically a purée of onions and butter - don't recall seeing that word before either). Did not regret that either! The dish was light (for a meat dish) yet filling, and you can taste that food comes fresh from the farm. I wonder how they cooked red beet, as it came out so juicy and tender (not an easy task for beets!); the sweet onion soubise complemented the dish perfectly, and the strawberries were full of flavor yet not too sweet with a light smoky taste. Delicious.\n\nI would most certainly recommend this restaurant for anyone who lives in Atlanta or is visiting, you won't regret it.\n\nThank you,\nA",

        "text": "Excellent food and service. \n\nThe combination of flavors is surprising and fun, and they all work so well together. I also love all the house-made items (including the soda!! Peach soda or rhubarb lemonade, anyone?). How about the charcuterie?! You cannot go wrong with any of the starters. Incredible. \n\nWe ordered: fried corn fritters, baked egg (so good!), charcuterie (pork pate!!!!), pork belly (holy crap), and hummus. All were great hits. \n\nOnly slight miss is in the entrees. The pork chop was good, but not as \"life changing\" as the starters. The duck breast was supposed to be medium rare but came out more medium/almost well done. But the flavors were all great. \n\nService is great. Attentive but not overbearing and our server knew every detail of every dish, and made superb recommendations for our group.",

        "text": "Miller Union more than lived up to its reputation as one of Atlanta's best restaurants on our recent visit on a warm Saturday night. We made reservations for the patio for a special occasion, and were immediately seated in an intimate corner of their understated, almost industrial outdoor space. We started with selections from their thoughtful wine menu, with her having a sparkling rose and me going with a crisp Gruner, before turning to the menu. As vegetarians, we couldn't sample the full breadth of what Miller Union offers, but they have enough vegetarian options to make the experience worthwhile. We started with the famous farm egg in celery cream with grilled bread. It more than lived up to its hype as one of the city's best dishes, and was unlike anything I have had. The freshness of the egg and the depth of the cream sauce, along with the waiters instructions on how to fold the dish together before digging in, walked the line perfectly between haute cuisine and comfort eating. We followed that up with a few vegetable dishes. The farro salad sitting in a pool of bright red beet sauce was incredibly fresh and satisfying, and the feta dip with lavash and crudités featured a wonderful sampling of the sweetest summer produce. For our entree, we split a seasonal vegetable plate, which was an assortment of vegetables prepared in various ways- grilled, raw, stewed, and so on. Everything was exquisitely seasoned and well-cooked, and even the simplest raw tomatoes were a delight. After indulging in another glass of wine- a Portuguese white- we turned to their dessert menu. She went with a chocolate pavé, which was dense and rich and the perfect chocolate dessert, whereas I had a well-balanced cheese selection, with an accompaniment of fresh jams. We paired that with a glass of port, before our server surprised with a complimentary glass of champagne, as we were celebrating a special occasion. On top of the exquisite food, the service throughout was thoughtful and unpretentious, and we left feeling very well cared for. Miller Union far exceeded any expectations I had going in, and I look forward to visiting again for more of Atlanta's finest.",

        "text": "I've been waiting for years to go to Miller Union - it's been consistently in the top restaurants of Atlanta. Finally got a chance to go, on a Friday, we hopped on 2 empty seats at the bar. \n\nService: First impression was not good, all the bartenders ignored us as we sat down, finally in a pass one of them asks what we want. I ask for a dinner menu, and some questions on two cocktails. The answer was very laconic as in \"they are different\", i was really expecting more of a description of the cocktails but I did not get it, so I let it go. I order one of them, which turns out just ok, very floral ( wish he would have mentioned that). \n\nFood: Now to get to the food, which I had hoped it would make up for the non friendly bar service. \n\nCharcuterie board : A joke, it was essentially half a loaf of bread and 3 slices of pancetta. Nobody explained even what the meats were... but they were very scarce, probably one of the saddest charcuterie boards I've seen in a while and did not strike me as high quality meat, or cured in the house .. who knows. A board usually comes with a story, maybe I've been spoiled. At $20+ for a board I was expecting way more.\n\nScallops (appetizer): Just ok, I think they are executed better at other top Atlanta restaurants, and at $8 a scallop I felt like I was a bit robbed. \n\nLemon Ricotta Ravioli (Main course) : I was envisioning this to be a fat juicy homemade ravioli. The dish came out, I thought they had brought me the wrong thing. The dish was all soaked in some juice, like a soup; the the ravioli were the flattest, soggiest ravioli I've ever had, no joke. It was quite awful, probably  the biggest disappointment of the night. \n\nSteak (main course) : steak was good, but nothing memorable that I would want to come back for. \n\nDrinks:  Cocktails were ok, I didn't know what to order because the bartender didn't feel like recommending or describing something. We switched to wine , and asked for a Malbec. He told me they don't carry Malbec, so I was like ok, I'll have a Cabernet Sauvignon (I wanted a full body wine to go with my steak). After looking at me like I just ordered a Coors Light, the bartender then tells me that they don't carry the Cab either, because \"we do things differently around here.\" I think I might have burst in a laughter at that point. I tried 3 of the wines he recommended, one of them a Bordeaux which was $20/glass, and I thought they were all watered down and light. I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means, but I've been to many vineyards in Napa, France, and Italy, and I think I can taste a decent wine. \n\nI left feeling ripped off and confused by the very underwhelming overall experience, how can this be  possibly rated as one of the top Atlanta restaurants ?? No clue.",
