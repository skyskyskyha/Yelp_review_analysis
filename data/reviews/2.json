        "text": "Such a wonderful experience all around! We had the best service and food - every detail was  considered. We started off with some tasty (and strong) cocktails - I got a Bellini because when in Georgia, have peaches! Definitely don't skip the pastry basket - their cinnamon rolls are so tasty with warm caramel and pecans. \nWe took every recommendation from our server which was totally spot on! The she crab soup was rich and delicious with the sherry, and the salad and lox pancakes were so fresh and the flavors were really complex and complimentary. \nWhen we mentioned we wanted to split some items, they actually plated them separately for us which was amazing!\n\nThe environment is classic and traditional - nice white tablecloths, and while it got a bit noisy during peak brunch hours, we were able to have a very comfortable conversation. Afterwards, we had a lovely seat by the Chattahoochee River in some of their Adirondack chairs - this is a truly lovely Atlanta classic!",

They printed a special menus with a message of congratulations from the staff which was a sweet touch that we took home as a keepsake. \n\nEverything we are was delish however, I am writing from memory so I don't want to say we ate anything specific. I do know we came out of it happy and full. The wine was paired for us based on preferences. \n\nI would live to go back on a weekday evening. We were there on a Friday night, so it was full and a bit loud so I would like to experience it during a less busy night. \n\nBut yes, please experience Canoe!",

We sat outside overlooking the water and a gazebo where we watched a couple get engaged.  Service was prompt and attentive to our needs.  A server came around to bring fresh bread of choice from a platter which was different from the typical basket on a table but still satisfying.  I ordered the pork chop ($37) that came with a sweet potato side that was tender and cooked to perfection with flavor.  We didn't feel rushed and were able to talk and enjoy our reunion.  They offer free valet parking to patrons.  It was actually a birthday celebration for two of us and they brought out dessert we shared amongst us.  \n\nA great visit with great food.  We would definitely return.",

The pecan sticky buns were absolutely delightful. We also tried the smoked salmon in crispy potato which is apparently the thing to get here. This appetizer was absolutely delicious, a must try. My friend got the burger which he really seemed to enjoy. I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict. My entree was good, not great.

One of the best run restaurants you will ever go to. \n\nHad the best experience last night in one of the private rooms for a wedding party. I highly recommend booking this place for a party and or wedding. They know what they're doing. This was the second wedding party that I've attended here. Both times were outstanding. \n\nLiterally the best dinner I've had in 2023. Excellent",

        "text": "Husband surprised me with a birthday date night here. The outside area is amazing! We are planning to come back to see it when it's light outside but we enjoyed a cocktail and people watching before dinner. \nThe food was ok. The oysters came with a cucumber mignonette that had way too much pepper. My husband said he couldn't taste or smell anything but pepper for several minutes after-to the point that he asked our server to inform the chef and he even agreed! They comped his drink for this-bit not the oysters, which was odd. My scallops were served luke warm and the \"stew\" was not as described, but more like a bland mixture of veggies. \nMy cocktail was beautiful and tasty!\nThe popcorn sundae was the star of the show!!\n\nThe timing seemed off, such that there were abnormal waits between courses.",

It's free but good to keep the tip ready. \nThey started with the fresh baked bread and specifically the crispy spicy bread with butter was super good ! \n\nOrdered Smoked Salmon as an appetizer - it was the recommendation by the server and I will give it 5 Stars ! Absolutely amazing ! Fresh & delectable. \n\nFish Tacos were good - 3 in the entree but more like Taquitos, good sauce and quite filling. \nChicken breast  sandwich with truffle fries was awesome  ! Made and served very nicely. \n\nServer was really courteous and nice. She told us about the history of Canoe and showed the pictures when it was flooded in 2009. \nReally nice and cozy place. \n\nThe atmosphere was serene. Sat inside on window seat, facing the River. Very nice & personal ambience. \nDefinitely a good choice to celebrate a birthday,  anniversary or any milestone event.",

        "text": "We have been wanting to come here for quite some time and finally made it. Since we live up in North GA it's a bit of a drive to here but we are glad we did and we celebrated my birthday. \n\nFirst thing, valet park and I think it's free but tip well since I don't think you will get to park anywhere close if you don't\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful, open and with friendly faces of the staff. I think our waiter was Chris and he was great at answering questions and making recommendations. \n\nWe did try the peppered kangaroo to start with and I was hesitant since I had never had it and I kept thinking of a cute roo. Well I have to say it was good and tasted sort of like roast beef. I was surprised and the sauce that went with it was amazing. To try with it we did have the house special Manhattan and it was very well made and not weakly made like some places. \n\nFor the entree I had the filet and my husband had the rabbit. I didn't try the rabbit since the sauce has goat cheese it in and I'm allergic but he loved it and said it was decadent and delicious. My field was amazing. Well cooked, sides went perfect and I had no complaints. \n\nDessert we got the iconic Carmel popcorn sundae which was beautiful, fun and tasty. It was our favorite. We also got the carrot cake. The cake was amazing and full of spices you'd expect but the frosting was a bit too sweet\n\nIt was an amazing, well timed, and delicious meal. I can understand the draw and why people keep coming back",

Understanding that the tables were first come first serve, we decided to wait for a nicer view.\n\nWhat I appreciated the most about the waiting experience was the hostess was very informative on the table that we were waiting on by coming to check in. It gave us time to get drinks and take pictures. \n\nI enjoyed a great drink from the bartender Massey . It was like a lemon drop twist with elderberry and proscecco!

Very good portion as well. \n\nOur waitress, Patricia, was super nice and funny and did her job too well because the whole table ended up ordering chocolate espresso martinis per her suggestion.

We had a small wait in the bar area and the bartender came over within 2 minutes with drink menus. The bellinis were very refreshing.\n\nWe had the assorted pastry basket which came with two sticky buns and two scones. They had various flavors such as apple and cheddar, goat cheese and roasted red pepper, and carrot and ginger. We ended up getting the small basket with a plain scone and a goat cheese and red pepper scone. The basket came with salted butter, fruit compote, and chocolate cream cheese. We preferred the goat cheese scone over the plain scone.\n\nMy main course was the fried shrimp. It was crunchy with topped with a remoulade sauce. The salad came with a lot of shrimp. The big surprise was the onion ring on top. I couldn't eat the entire salad and they were nice enough to box my leftovers. They even separated the shrimp from the salad so it wouldn't be soggy the next day. Overall, love my experience here.",

He had a gigantic smile and such and an ease about the way he served us. He truly made the experience magical! He had such attention to detail and assured we enjoyed everything we ordered. \n\nHe did an amazing job. The restaurant was packed for a Sunday night and his section appeared to be very full, but that didn't subtract from the attention or card we received. I highly recommend sitting in his section if he's available when you visit. \n\nLet's talk food and drinks now- the cocktails are my favorite- we started with two Don't call me Shirley's. They are perfection, refreshing, and go down easily. My friend tried the Tom riddle, but didn't love the sweetness in it. We snacked on their amazing bread basket before heading outside to walk the grounds. \n\nWe ordered the house smoked salmon on crispy potato cakes, peppercorn crusted kangaroo, and the arugula salad. The smoked salmon potato cakes are unique and flavorful, the peppercorn was delicious, but a tad too salty for our taste, and the arugula salad was perfect filled with spiced nuts and slivers of citrus fruit. \n\nWe toured the grounds while waiting for our appetizers to arrive, and enjoyed looking at the beautiful Chattahoochee river and flowers. \n\nFor dinner we split the panko crusted George's bank cod- it was hands down the best thing we ate! I'm so happy Austin recommended it because I absolutely loved the flavors!!! The panko crust was very light which I loved.  \n\nI absolutely love love love canoe and cannot wait to return!!",

        "text": "My only complaint is the parking was confusing. They say you can self park but the entire parking lot says no canoe parking - see valet. However, on weekends when those other businesses are closed, it's fine for you to park there \n\nMy favorite food here was the pastry basket. The sticky buns are so good, we almost ordered more but luckily self control saved us. The basket also came with 4 scones with 1 being savory. They all looked and smelled delicious, but I only ate some sticky bun. The pastry basket is a must have for the table! \n\nI ordered the bloody Mary drink and mine came with a couple olives, 1 pepperonicini, & a celery stick. Other tables came with other items so not sure what it's actually supposed to have. One woman's had a shrimp in hers but our server said we had the same drink but the flavor of the drink itself was great. Spicy, salty and not too sour! \n\nI got the springer mountain chicken which comes with cheddar grits, chicken and a few french beans covered in au jus. I'm usually not bothered by texture but the grits had the weirdest texture. Normally, when you get grits, they're like shrimp & grits where they're creamy and eaten with a spoon because they're like a thick soup. These grits had the texture of one wide, thin, grit jelly like I mean you jellied your grits and you should eat them with a fork. They tasted ok but the texture was so strange. The chicken was good, crispy skin and moist meat and the au jus was a nice flavor but started solidifying as I ate through the meal where I was expecting more of the sauce consistency of the jus you get with a prime rib. \nNot my favorite dish by far. \n\nI ended up eating more of my husband's riverside than my own food which he just kept pushing his plate closer to me when he noticed.  That is a great breakfast. I wish the bacon was crispier but they gave you a bunch and the eggs were soft scrambled & even Gordon Ramsay would approve. The hashbrowns were crispy outside, soft inside, french toast was delicious and they give you so much syrup, you'll never drink it all haha \n\nWe ended up with the banana cream pie as dessert and the filling was delicious. Loved the creme bruleed banana part but wasn't crazy about the pie crust. It was so dense and for a dessert of that price($11) that fits in the palm of my hand, most of it was crust which held together nicely but overpowered the piece. Would stick with the popcorn ice cream sundae next time. \n\nPretty restaurant for a scenic meal",

We made a reservation (recommended) and showed up right on time. \nValet parking is super awesome. Drive right up and walk in. Nice. We were immediately taken to our table. Steve was our waiter. He was super helpful. He gave us some really great suggestions and told us the specials of the day. They all sounded fantastic. We ordered our drinks and appetizers. We ordered the crab cakes and calamari. What a start. The appetizers were as expected, excellent. \nWe next ordered our entree. We got two of the specials and a steak filet. Mussels and an Alaskan fish plate special were both very good. The steak was tender and, as ordered, med/rare. Wow. I'm so glad we remembered this place. \nWe finished with some desserts. I had the popcorn flavored one and also ordered the Lava Cake. Again, both were good. \nThe entire meal, from beginning to end, was fantastic. Steve helped us make some real good choices. We really enjoyed his excitement. His recommendations were spot on. \nThe ambiance is awesome. On the river. Inside or out, the view is nice and really adds to the whole experience of this place. It's a very romantic, great atmosphere, and nice place for a great meal. The food was good before and this time was as great as I remembered. It definitely did not disappoint us. You will love it. I guarantee it.",

Though our party was there on time, the bride was late (she thought it was a regular breakfast with her fiancé) lol we ordered appetizers to ensure we weren't wasting time as it was very busy. Once the bride arrived, we ordered food and everything was great. I mean, no complaints whatsoever. The only hiccup was the valet parking. It was busy but it seemed the staff became confused with the rush of people.",

Just laying outside of the hustle and bustle of Atlanta is this absolute gem of a restaurant . It was a little later in the evening for our reservation so we didn't get to enjoy the outdoor setting this visit (which is stunning). The staff are always so respectful and accommodating. We were a bit ambitious bringing our son, but we are from Florida and didn't have an option, the one point I have to make is the huge impact it made for every person to acknowledge, say hi and even a fist bump. It seriously made all the difference.\n\nAs for the food, as you can expect it was amazing. I had the snapper over risotto, the fish was a larger portion than I thought and I ate the entire dish.",

They started out strong with the kangaroo appetizer which was AMAZING, probably one of the best first bites of meat I've ever had and honestly the only reason I'm giving this restaurant a 4/5 and not a 3/5. \n\nThe rabbit was just fine, I honestly enjoyed the pasta that accompanied it far more than the game itself. \n\nAlso, the service was incredibly subpar for what I expected from a white table cloth restaurant. One waiter came around and almost gave us the wrong food. Additionally, my boyfriend and I came to canoe to celebrate his birthday and I left a note to the waiters telling them about this special occasion. However, as you can see, on our dessert plate says \"happy anniversary.\" A small misstep I know but again, not what I expected from this place, and enough to not make me want to come back again.",

They knew the menu well and were able to make suggestions.  The drinks were perfect.   The food was delicious.  We tried a lot of different dishes and every one of them was solid.   One person in our party ordered a burger and said that it was the best one he had ever had.  Deserts were interesting.   It is not cheap but reasonable for what you get and the quality.   My only negative is that the menu is heavy on the meat.   They had seafood which was great, but there could have been a few more options and if you are vegetarian or vegan there is really not much on the menu for you.   With that said, they were super accommodating and were happy to put something together for the vegan in our party, but it's a lot of effort for the customer and may bring unwanted attention to that individual, so really, why not just have a couple veggie options on the menu besides salad.  Ya know?\n\nAnyway, the place is a home run and I highly recommend going here.  Can't wait to come back.",

Originally , for all you seriously long time Atlantans, the home of Robinson's Tropical Garden, Canoe is located in no kidding Vinings (not Smynings) next to the West Paces Ferry Bridge over the Chattahoochee. A bridge I know from experience you really should not jump off. It's only about six feet deep and you hit the bottom pretty hard. \n\nThat said, there are only two restaurants on the Chattahoochee, in metro Atlanta - Rays and Canoe  - and both offer great river views and were there long before Jimmy Carter grabbed the river for the federal government. \n\nThe best thing about Canoe is not the ambiance or the river, it's the food.  I love their menu and love heir wine list. I love their service and I love this place.  It's our \"go to\"place for any special occasion. I'm so glad they got there before Jimmy Carter gave our whole river to the Feds.",

        "text": "This restaurant is so beautiful and delicious! We were visiting Atlanta for a small road trip and stumbled upon Canoe. We sat outside and it was absolutely gorgeous. Definitely set a lovely ambiance. We got the salmon and chicken sandwich. The salmon was very tender and yummy! I loved the smoky flavor paired with the refreshing salad. The chicken sandwich was also delicious, especially the truffle fries with rosemary. \n\nI really cannot speak enough about the outdoor setting. It actually is very gorgeous and so soothing with the river flowing and wind gently blowing. Our waitress was also very knowledgeable about the menu and answered all our questions and took very good care of us. \n\nWhen we come to Atlanta again, we definitely will be going back to Canoe for a nice brunch or lin",

They gave us a cute menu that said \"Happy Anniversary\"  and allowed for us to keep the menu so we can have a keepsake from the evening. The food was still so delicious and the customer service continues to amaze me. I highly recommend Canoe for your celebrations! Thank you canoe for making our anniversary so special!",

        "text": "IT'S ALL TRUE!! NO LIES DETECTED HERE! Yes, all the positive reviews about Canoe are spot on! We had a small company department holiday dinner here in early December and were all completely blown away by the ambiance, the service, and the food. While prices are not cheap, it was quite reasonable for an upscale restaurant with the quality of the food you get here. I personally had ordered:\n\nCanoe's House Smoked Salmon, Crispy Potato Cake, Creamy Goat's Cheese - Recommended by our server. It's basically an upscale version of smoked salmon and cream cheese. It's quite decadent and definitely a sharing size. I had enough to take back to my hotel room for a late night snack.\n\nWood Grilled 8oz Beef Tenderloin, Hop'd Potatoes, Watercress, Cheddar Mustard - I ordered this without the Cheddar Mustard (not a mustard fan) and it was absolutely delicious, even without the sauce, although I would have probably enjoyed an alternative sauce offering.\n\nAnd we ordered 1 of each dessert for the table (you can see all 7 in the photo):\n\nGerman Chocolate Cake, Pecans, Caramel, Coconut\nPopcorn Ice Cream Sundae, Canoe's Peanut Cracker Jack, Chantilly\nNot Your Momma's Sweet Potato Pie, Vanilla Bean Cookie, Nougat, Fig Jam\nSticky Bun Bread Pudding, Orange, Eggnog Ice Cream, Currants\nChampagne - Pear Sorbet, Cranberry & Raspberry Jam, Vanilla Tuile\n\nThere were 2 other desserts that are not on the online menu, and I had forgotten to take a photo of the menu so I didn't get the actual names:\nS'mores Dessert\nChocolaty Panna Cotta Creme Brulee\n\nAll the desserts were amazing, but my favorite had to be the Chocolaty Panna Cota Creme Brulee one. LOL.\n\nNote - they did charge an event fee for our group, but it was described as kind of tip-share where everyone gets a portion of the fee, so we tipped a bit extra for our server Miranda who was very attentive.\n\nLooking forward to our next time in Atlanta so we can go to Canoe!",

We had a group of half dozen friends and everyone enjoyed their meal.  My choice was steak and eggs and sticky bun off the brunch menu. Great place to bring a date. Plenty of free and valet parking.  Nice gardens outside and we enjoyed short stroll along the river.\n\nThe not so good. Several of us got the steak and eggs.  We liked it, the steak was shaved; but we expected a nice piece of whole steak.  Also one guy got the french toast and it came out cold and he had to send it back.  No complementary selection of bread during Sunday brunch, but can be ordered off the menu. Canoe is expensive and other tables were celebrating special days like birthdays.  \n\nAll in all worth a stop if you are in the area.",

We met up with her boyfriend and settled in for drinks and dinner.   Everything was...good.  I wasn't blown away and here are a few reasons:\nCanoe Manhattan - not bad, but something felt...off.  Now I'll caveat and say that I'm quite spoiled by the amazing bartenders that are my friends and this could be why I wasn't blown away.  \nDuck something - it was ok.  Slightly overcooked but overall tasted ok. Maybe it was the end of the night, or maybe it was that my friend's boyfriend was very put off by the food, I don't know  \n\nBut overall, while a pleasant, wasn't blown away by the food for the cost.  Service and ambiance were phenomenal.  Maybe next time I visit we'll try again and have a different review to leave.",

Our waitress came right over as we were seated and got us water while she gave us time to peruse the menu.  \n\nWe ordered Manhattans to start and while we waited for our shared appetizer, they brought the bread basket. Charcuterie board had a nice assortment. Two cheeses, pickles, chicken pate and a chorizo and a salami along with toasted sourdough.  For entrees I had the duck breast and my companion had the panko crusted cod. For dessert, I really wanted to try the chocolate cake but sadly they were out, so I went with the popcorn sundae and he had the sorbet. \n\nService was excellent!  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. She was able to make good suggestions and anticipated all our needs.  The food was good.  I was a bit disappointed in the food as my expectations for what's touted as one of the best restaurants in Atlanta would be raving reviews but sadly I was underwhelmed.  It was just ok.  Food lacked flavor and presentation was average.  The service would bring me back to try again but I will also mention that noise level was loud!

They had anniversary menus specifically for us, which I thought was a nice addition for anybody celebrating their anniversary here. The server that we had was extremely knowledgeable and she also gave us her own recommendations which led us to try foods that we have never tried before, such as kangaroo and rabbit, both of which were phenomenal! Other than the cod being a little underseasoned, everything was absolutely delicious and I have been recommending all of my friends to go try this restaurant. \n\nIf I could, I would give 4/5 stars for the ambiance. The tables are pretty close together so it was pretty easy to hear other peoples conversations. The close proximity to others also made the area we were sitting in pretty loud and I had to talk with a raised voice most of the night.\n\nBut overall, it was a great experience and I'll definitely be back to try more of the food!",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our anniversary, and we had an incredible experience. We have been to some of the best places in Atlanta (big foodies), and they don't hold a candle to Canoe. I highly recommend this place. The food was amazing, and the value was outstanding. We ordered two appetizers, two entrées, a dessert, and multiple drinks, yet our bill was under $200 for gourmet, delicious, and fabulous food. We were astounded by the value; you get not only a beautiful restaurant and exceptional service but also ample, high-quality food at an unbeatable price, that is unprecedented in today's economy.\n\nThe service was phenomenal. Our waiter, a student at KSU, displayed a level of professionalism and knowledge of the menu that belied his youth. It was truly white-glove service. The several times we were wished a happy anniversary made the night even more special; it was printed on the menus, mentioned as we came in, and written in chocolate on our dessert.\n\nThe standout dishes included the Kangaroo appetizer, which my partner said was one of the best things he's ever eaten. The seasonal bread offering (cranberry walnut bread) was, surprisingly, one of my favorite items of the night. The maple duck, recommended by our waiter, was cooked to perfection.\n\nThanks for a great night Canoe, we will 1000000% be back.",

        "text": "Canoe is an Atlanta staple; you really can't go wrong here. Located in Vinings, you're right next to the beautiful Chattahoochee River. You'll get an eclectic mix of American and Australian dishes, each delicious! We tried the salmon, lamb, duck, and scallops. Each was flavored and balanced well! We started with the crab cake, which was to die for, and the shrimp. The shrimp was a bit peppery, otherwise a pretty good eat. The service was fast and pleasant. I'll definitely be back!",

        "text": "I hate writing dissappointing reviews, but I will always be honest, as I look to reviews to tell me about new places. \n\nI have wanted to visit Canoe for several years now and my wife and finally got the chance as one of our friends decided to have her Birthday Dinner here. \n\nThe atmosphere is very nice, the waiter we had was so friendly and nice. \n\nThe food was just okay, but highly under seasoned and the quality of the food for sure did not match up to the price. \n\nI think the most dissappointing thing we ordered was the Charcuterie Board as an appetizer. Now, my wife and I are BIG fans of Charcuterie Boards, we order them all the time and we make them at home all the time. This Charcuterie Board was around $22 I believe and the description on the menu was vague...like chefs selections of meats, fine cheese, mustard and pickles. When the Charcuterie Board came out, it had very hard dry salami, 2 pieces of prosciutto, mustard sauce (which was pretty good), duck liver pate, a few very hard crackers and two very small hard pieces of cheese, which no one told us what they were, the pickle was a piece of pickled ginger with the skin still on it. \n\nUnless things change, I doubt I would go back. I wish this would have been a much better experience.",

It tasted like glorified overpriced chain restaurant food. Severely disappointing. I would not recommend eating here as there are far more plentiful and better options in the Atlanta area. \n\nJust to drive this point home, after I left, I went to a McDonald's and ate a Big Mac because I felt so unsatisfied. Yes, a Big Mac tasted better than my meal at Canoe this evening.",
