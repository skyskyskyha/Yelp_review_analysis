        "text": "I have been trying to come here for a few months now and I finally made it. \nWe were able to sit at a bar table since we were working it was more room. \nThe waitress was there to get us water but we were still getting adjusted and she asked our drink order. Of course we weren't ready. \n20 min later she come back and takes our drink order and food. It was kind of funny cause we were like did she ever come back and here she comes. \nShe takes our order and it wasn't a long wait to get the food or drinks. \nThe long waits is the service. I was reading reviews as I sat waiting and it's disappointing how consistent it is. \nI would love to come back. Definitely an added touch and I love seeing more when management comes to help out.. but next time I would rather have it to go.\n\nThe chicken batter is really good. The Mac and cheese has so far been the best I had in Georgia. The greens were seasoned and meaty but the candied yams. I prefer mine soft. These safe close to candied yams that are in a can but still good flavor.\nAlso it's no dress code . I watched so many people come with t shirts and denim cut up jeans.",

        "text": "I've come to Roc South a few times. I've dined in, sat at the bar and have ordered out and have been happy with my experience every time.\n\nRoc South is an elevated Soul Food experience. A higher price point, but the service, ambiance and  food are on par with the increase.\n\nThe food has been excellent every time I've been. I normally get a cup of the Seafood Gumbo which is so good, and they don't skimp on the seafood. The cup is also a nice sized portion for one person. I've also tried the Southern Fried Chicken with  the greens and Mac and cheese (which is prob one of the best Mac and cheeses I've had in a while) and the Salmon Pasta both which were excellent. Perfectly seasoned and big enough portions. \n\nIt's been hard finding really good Soul Food in Atlanta which baffles me, but Roc South definitely delivers.",

        "text": "Who doesn't love Soul Food? I decided to meet a friend to celebrate finishing the work week and Roc South was on my list of places to try while hanging out in the ATL! There is a valet available and it's tip based. I called prior and was told there was a 15 minute wait for a table. When I arrived the restaurant was packed and were told that it would be a 2hr wait. Thankfully we were able to snag two seats at the bar. Starting off we ordered some drinks and started off with the crab cakes. The crab cake was delicious with actual crab and not just fillers. For my entree I ordered the fried chicken with Mac and cheese, collard greens, and a side of corn bread. The chicken was good nothing out of this world. I'm not a huge fan of collard greens but these were ok. The macaroni was good just a tad bit wet for my liking. Corn bread was delicious. All in all we had a great time customer service. Make sure if you check this place out you have a reservation or are there during off hours.",

        "text": "For starters, there's complimentary (aka tip based)  valet parking only. The lot isn't super big so maybe that's why. Pay attention while driving as the one entrance to here can be easily missed. \n\nThis was my first time dining in. I went in a week and they were launch in their first weekday HH. My expectations were completely different as it was themed Soul Sessions. So I expected live music and a total vibe. There was not- just a DJ playing soft music . I arrive around 445 and HH was until 6. It was pretty empty but seemed to start to pick up when I left around 530. \n\nFor HH they offer half off selected entrees. If you're pescatarian like me that leaves you with 3 options: seafood egg rolls, honey lemon pepper shrimp, and seafood dip. Based on the waitress recommendations I tried the shrimp and seafood dip. \nThe shrimp were super salty and I couldn't make it through all 6. The waiter was super nice and had them remake them for me. I thought the second batch was better up but by the second in, I couldn't finish it so I just started removing the breading. The seafood was okay and definitely more filling, but the seafood in it (crawfish, shrimp and something else) were over cooked, hence a lot of left over when I was done (last pic). I drank 3 full glasses of water within 30 min while trying to eat these 2 dishes. If you didn't have hypertension when you went, you might have it when you leave. Lol. \n\nPreviously I've had their catfish plate with yams, collards and Mac n cheese to go (a few years ago) and those were good. It was my first time trying these two items and I would just stick to what I know. The HH total price for these 2 (no drink) was $17 and some change. $10 for the dip and $6 for the shrimp. Overall, I wouldn't go back to order these again.",

My party of 4 arrived on time however, the restaurant had just opened which means a line had then formed outside. The manager did the right thing and apologized for our wait, but listen it was 90 degrees outside, please open on time. Finally they let us in and sat us in a back booth. After we looked over the menu and after the waitress took our drink orders, a large party of 15 people were sat by us. After the waitress brought our drinks, we eventually noticed her taking the large party's (who was sat after us at least 15-20 mins later) order. Therefore we had to wait an extra 20 minutes or so to get our order in. After we complained, she tried to make it seem like it was our fault when in fact it was hers because at that time, she was flabbergasted. She didn't even apologize and because of this and us being on a time limit, the same manager that apologized to us for making us wait outside in the hot weather, came by our table and told us we were at our limit. But before she even told us that, she asked how everything was. We just told her it was \"okay.\" She didn't ask us why was it just \"okay\" or if there was any issues or anything. She just said \"okay\" and our time limit was up. Lastly, the food was just ok so I don't feel like this is a brunch spot worth visiting again.",

The cornbread was very sweet and you can tell they add cake batter. But everything else was delicious. \n\nThe inside is cute with blues and browns and low light. I wouldn't call it fancy but it isn't extremely casual either. \n\nThey also have mandatory valet parking. Lastly, make a reservation because it gets crowded quickly.",

        "text": "Brunch on a Friday and overall a good experience. We made reservations only through resy. This restaurant is valet parking usually however we were only directed by the valet person on hour to park this particular day. We checked in and were seated right away. We decided to start with wings as an appetizer i forget the name of the flavor but i was good and seasoned well my only wish is that they didn't skimp us on the ranch. For drinks we got a carafe of mimosa strawberry flavored that serves about 6 flute sizes. I wanted to try the turkey wings but wasn't given the best views on them (advised they were hot or miss) so i decided to go the bodega sandwich with chicken sausage (it wasn't bad but nothing spectacular either) and a side of grits the grits were thick and tasty i believe they used a Gouda cheese as they had a rich and smoky flavor. My friend got the Brussel sprouts which she really enjoyed (crispy and seasoned well) and she got the grits and short ribs which she also enjoyed but said they could have given a little more of the meat as it was only a small portion. The restaurant has a nice vibe with a dj.",

Moved to the blackened salmon with greens and Mac and cheese as sides. All were flavorful. The portions were solid and unlike every other restaurant I've tried in Atlanta, the value matched the price. \n\nI wish I'd had room for dessert, but DO NOT skip the honey butter biscuit!

        "text": "Roc South has been on the list of places I'd like to try for quite some time now so I was so happy to finally get a chance check it out with my cousin.\n\nThe valet parking is complementary and accepts tips which was nice as the valet service was efficient and kind. Upon entry there was very nice mellow hip hop and R&B playing which set a nice vibe for the restaurant. The restaurant is very intimate, my only wishes are that it was a bit bigger inside to offer more space in between tables and that you could be granted more time at your table (I believe it's a 2 hour max, which I completely understand as it's a high demand restaurant). \n\nOur server was very nice. I tried both the Pear-lini and the Harlem Peach to drink and my cousin had Riesling and Stella Rosa. The beer options are pretty limited so would keep that in mind if you're someone looking for a wide variety. My entree was the Southern Fried Chicken, dark meat, with collards greens and French fries. I'm very picky about fried chicken so was so happy the chicken was flavorful and juicy. I wish the Turkey meat in the collard greens wasn't so dry but otherwise the entree was great. My cousin has the Southern Fried Catfish and LOVED the Mac & Cheese. \n\nWill definitely return. Hoping to get a brunch reservation soon.",

        "text": "3.8/5\n\nI came twice in one weekend. I will combine the experience for this review.\n\nService: Had a reservation both times, yet still had to wait an additional 15-20 mins to be seated. Not too much of a problem because it beats having to wait 1-2hrs w/o one. It also takes them a while to make it back over to the table for periodic check-ins. Other than that, the service was decent but they are extremely slow. The first night our drinks came out after we had already finished our food. I wanted to tell the server to forget about it and take it off the bill; but by the next I was able to flag here down she came to the table with the drinks in her hand.\n\nFood: Both nights I went, the food took at least 20-35 mins to come out. I can say that the food is always spot on. The flavors and seasoning are always consistent. I highly recommend the fried chicken wings or the fried catfish with the honey hot sauce and the Mac and cheese. I will say since the food is consistent, I do plan to try more options. \n\nAmbiance: Always really nice inside, good for a bday dinner, date, or just because. They do have valet parking, which I think is tips only. \n\nOverall: I will be back, but I'll always make a reservation before coming. The food is always good, but I do hope they brush up on their wait times; which goes for seating, food/drinks, and service.",

Nice portion size of shrimp with chicken sauce and a to die for sauce, last but not least they put gouda cheese in the grits! Man oh man! Some of the best Shrimp and Grits I've ever had.  The Mac and cheese was really really good as well.\n\nThe fried whiting plate with Mac and cheese with yams was a 10/10 as well! Same goes for the salmon croquettes. The service was meh, I felt he could've been more attentive to the table. He was very forgetful as well.

        "text": "When the little girl across the street was growing up, she wanted me to take her to McDonald's. Now 20 years and two hundred miles away, that little girl is all grown up and wants to meet at Roc South. We spend the evening talking about her and all of the neighbor kids playing Cranium and Mario Kart.  Summers of kickball and swimming. Peanut butter fights and nights under the streetlight. We shake our heads in amazement about how all of those bratty little kids grew up and are now doctors, teachers, preachers and parents. \n\nOnce we arrived, we were immediately whisked to a table and greeted by our server. The menu was found by scanning a QR code on the table. We had so much to catch up on, our poor server came by three times before we were ready to order. \n\nWe opted for the seafood dip for our app and I chose to indulge with a \"Call me a Taxi\" - a tequila based drink - a little sweet, a little tart. The seafood dip was excellent. Served with a toasted, garlicky baguette, the bowl was full of seafood chunks in a creamy, cheesy sauce. The crust of slightly browned cheese on top was an added bonus. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the blackened, lemon butter salmon. I was served a large piece of salmon that was topped with a buttery sauce and capers. I didn't detect anything that indicated that it had been blackened, but, nonetheless, it was absolutely delicious. Totally carbing out, I chose yams and mac and cheese as my two sides. The mac and cheese was topped with a layer of melted cheese and was outstanding. The yams were good but a little too much cinnamon and a little to much sugar made them more dessert than side dish. I wouldn't choose them again. The portions were large, I probably boxed up more than I ate. \n\nThe grown up little girl ordered the southern fried catfish. Several medium size filets, fried crisp, were served with a little cup of hot honey sauce. She also chose the yams and switched her sides up with collards. She said it was all excellent. \n\nSometimes with a lot of background noise, I have a bit of trouble hearing, and, as the restaurant filled, the background noise increased to that point so we decided to call it a night. I was sad for our night to end but I am so proud of the woman that that little girl has grown up to be. I not only left with a full tummy, I left with a full heart.",

The Southern fried chicken in honey hot sauce, collard greens, and Norweigan salmon cakes are amazing!  Plus thaw honey butter biscuit is delicious.\n\nI really couldn't taste the Gouda in the Gouda grits but they were decent. The macaroni and cheese is cooked properly, but could have used more seasoning as well.\n\nIn addition, they definitely need more valet staff.  Parking took way too long (10 minutes) because there was only one valet person working.  Also, there was no Bloody Mary mix for Bloody Mary's, a brunch staple.\n\nOverall, a fantastic experience.  It's a bit pricey for brunch so check prices if that matters to you. I will definitely be back, and highly recommend checking it out!",

        "text": "Visited with my mentor around 3pm on a Sunday. We had a reservation for 3:30pm. We arrived promoted at 3:30 and was told to grab a seat and someone would be with us. Prior to sitting down I noticed a family that was sitting down as well. After about 30 minutes someone came over and apologized for the wait and said the kitchen was backed up. Around 4:15 someone approached us asking if we would like mimosas.  We got one and was seated a few minutes later. \n\nUpon being seated (45ish minutes after a reservation) we were greeted by our waitress. She took our drink and food orders. My mentor ordered an appetizer and entree. After waiting for a few moments I added a salad to my order. Our food came out a few moments later with both the appetizer and entrees arriving at the same time. Shortly after my mentor ordered a drink and I received my salad. About a little over 20 minutes, my mentor hasn't received his drink and we had to ask for it twice. Once he received his drink and I realize time was winding down, I ordered another drink and placed an order for a dessert. After another very long wait, I asked another waitress about my drink and dessert. The initial waitress approached another table very aggressively stating they had already received their drink. After a slight back and forth, the waitress walked away. As she was leaving I mentioned to her that I was the one asking for my drink and she replied \"I said it's coming\" very rudely. Before receiving my drink or dessert, our waitress had brought our check and told us to have a good night. I again mentioned that I hadn't received my drink and the waitress got smart again.  The other  nice waitress brought my drink shortly after and apologized for the inconvenience. A few moments later the initial (and rude) waitress returned with our dessert in a to go container despite us saying we wanted to eat there. When we asked about the dessert, she replied that they were out. As we exited, the waitress approached us again with a receipt returning the money for the dessert.\n\nWhile she did try to make up for it at the end, her continuous rude comments and interactions ruined my perception of the establishment. I wish I had remembered the other waitresses name because had it not been for her, I would've complained to the manager.\n\nOverall, the food was AMAZING. However the lack of professionalism with the staff ruined any of the positives.",

The white cheddar mac and cheese is my favorite item on the entire menu, but the honey hot sauce option on the chicken and shrimp are the perfect glaze. The portions are more than enough to have now and save some for later. The greens were yummy like your grandmas *insert drool here* and the candied yams taste like candy (good, but a little too sweet for my liking). 8/10 def recommend!",

        "text": "I've been looking forward to going to Roc South for forever so I'm glad I got to go before the year end.\n\nTip #1 -- have a reservation.\nThis is not a large location so seating is limited. We went on a Saturday at noon with a reservation and we are so glad we did because the wait was so long. However, i believe they move rather efficiently. Your reservation is canceled if you're more than ten minutes late and you can't be seated without your whole party there. Just some things to note.\n\nThey also claim that there's an 1hr30 seating limit which I'm not sure how strict they are on that. However, I do think that's ample enough time to eat and enjoy the ambiance.\n\nThis is your typical Southern style food which can always be a hit or miss. I'd say the menu is pretty decent, however I could understand why others would say it's limited. We ordered the seafood egg rolls as an appetizer. Very good, 10/10 and would order again.\n\nFor my main course, I got the fried catfish with Mac and cheese and candied yams. The yams carried the meal! I'm always skeptical about yams but this was 10/10. The food came out fresh and hot, Mac and cheese looked like it was fresh out the oven and paired great with the yams. The fried catfish was delicious as well especially when paired with the honey hot sauce.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and I'm looking forward to trying their infamous Sunday brunch!",

They have digital menus. The food was sooo good. I definitely recommend this place. I started with a seafood dip and seafood gumbo. Both were amazing, the gumbo had amazing flavor. I wanted hot sauce just because I like spice but it was great without. I followed up with the fried chicken, yams, Mac and cheese, with mash potatoes and short ribs. The gravy for the short ribs was so savory and the meat just fell apart. Great texture. The chicken come with an almost spicy Mumbo sauce. It was very good, not over seasoned and the sauce was no Mumbo sauce (DC area sauce) but was a great addition. I finished with the peach cobbler...wasn't my favorite. It was too much cake. Overall though a good meal.",

Simply put, it's the food.\nWe enjoyed...shrimp and steak egg-rolls, Mac & cheese, honey drizzled corn bread, seasoned collard greens, whole fried red snapper, fried catfish, fully dressed fried chicken breast dunked in a sweet slightly spicy sauce sandwich, ginger beers, crafts of mimosa, freshly squeezed lemonade and crispy fries. The only disappointment was the bland black-eyed peas. Had our server Imani- who was a pleasure - brought us some hot sauce, I might have forgotten that. \n\nThe place is nestled between 2 strip clubs.. but hey, its ATL, so who cares? However, you might miss it because its small.. but the line into valet that went into the street trigger us early. Bring tip money, ya heard...lol!\n\nThe restaurant menu is QR coded to take you to the website, so I advise you to use it while you wait because most likely you will. There's indoor and outdoor seating with a small bar area surrounded by additional seats. It's asmall place, but I  saw them accommodate 2 parties of 8, the quickly reset for groups of 5 and 6. The staff is busy as hell but friendly and accommodating. I think the music kept us all happy too!\n\nWe hope to try them for brunch.. but I'd rather try to find an open evening to chill at the bar and try their drinks. Definitely worth a few more visits.",

        "text": "We love Roc South! We visited this location spur of the moment on a Friday afternoon around 4PM. It was the perfect time to visit without reservations, there were plenty of tables available. We actually visited on Cinco De Mayo so it was only right to start with one of their speciality items for that day, the enchiladas, and they were delicious, 7/10. For our entrees we both tried the Southern Fried Chicken Whole Wings with yams, mac & cheese, and collard greens with a side of the cornbread! Everything 10/10! The chicken was tossed in a honey hot sauce that was sweet with a slight kick! The mac & cheese, yams, collard greens, and cornbread came out piping hot and full of flavor! We tell everyone how good roc south was, we can't wait to go back!",

The music was great and not too loud and our waitress made sure to check on us every now and then to make sure we were good. \n\nCheck them out next time you wanna grab brunch in Atlanta, just make a reservation before you go because it gets crowded quick!",

It was pretty good especially since they drizzled honey on top which made it sweet. For our entrees, we both ordered the southern fried chicken with yams and mac n' cheese. The chicken had good flavor and the yams are the best I've had at a restaurant. I was not impressed with the mac n' cheese at all, not much flavor.

Sides were greens and mac and cheese.. BUSSIN. I literally left maybe the eyes of my fish . Sucked the bones and all , I want to double back and order everything AGAIN.

        "text": "Was running errands and needed to eat something so Yelp came to my rescue. This was 3 mins from my location and here's my review:\n\nParking is valet. I'm not sure if there is a charge but they have a Cashapp setup for tips. \n\nLocation is pretty upscale so luxury cars, so expect nice business attire or classy casual is the best way I can describe it. \n\nAtmosphere is urban. Very classic and sleek. \n\nFood: Menu is mixed so you'll find different ethnic food choices which is great. Very good menu for drinks, wines and beers. \n\nService: I was greeted and there can be a long wait. I was told over an hour. Since I was hungry i opted for the first come first serve bar area. They don't typically do Sunday brunch to go so be aware if you are looking to get in and out. \n\nI was able to find a seat at the bar and decided to eat my food inside. I ordered the following \n\nPeach Bellini \nPeach lemonade \nSeafood egg rolls \nCurry vegetable bowl \n\nThe peach Bellini was really good and so were the egg rolls! They were actually amazing ! The 4 stars are for the curry. The wait on food was a little extensive but that curry - It was flavorless. All I could think about was my seasonings at home to fix it and I didn't have it so I took it to go. The salmon was pretty good though but decided to take the entire entree back home to doctor up. \n\nOther than that mishap the entire experience was nice. Lively and definitely somewhere to have a great experience. Good music, good fun and would definitely go back with friends and when I was a little more dolled up.",

Their honey wings are really good also. Tonight I came for dinner and it was just okay. I ordered their fried chicken without the sauce and it wasn't seasoned along with the Mac n cheese which wasn't seasoned either. The greens and cabbage and yams were good. The turkey wings were also good. Their gumbo appetizer was amazing and their Arnold Palmer is also good. Their cornbread was not good at all. I would come back here for the brunch rather than the dinner. Overall this is a good restaurant",

I'm not an egg or grits eater so I was pleased that the waiter informed me that for Sunday brunch they still offered select menu items from the Lunch menu. I chose the Gumbo. I was thoroughly surprised that it was as tasty as it was. A lot of restaurants try to cook Gumbo and miss the essence of the dish because they're trying to cater to universal palates. Overall it's a popular spot. My friends enjoyed their food as well.",
