        "text": "I'd heard that Tuk Tuk was the nicest Thai restaurant in Atlanta, so I gave it a go and would have to agree with that assessment! The balcony view was suburb, the hostess and server were wonderful, and the food came out fast. While these are typical standards, what made Tuk Tuk go above and beyond was the quality of their food. My Girlfriend and I got a beef kabob contraption that was outstanding, and my Pad Thai definitely beat out all the other Pad Thai I've had in Atlanta. Will definitely be back!",

We didn't have reservations, but I would recommend if you are going on a weekend tht you obtain a reservation beforehand.  The place continued to fill with patrons throughout our dinner.  Our server Brett was phenomenal. He made suggestions and all of his recommendations were superb.   \n\nThe atmosphere is sleek and sexy, but I still felt comfortable in a casual outfit.  Description of the dishes we tried are captured under the photos.   \n\nLast but not least, ample  free parking.  That's almost unheard of in midtown!!!",

This restaurant did NOT disappoint !!\n\nExperience was so good \n\nThe ambiance is so nice ,and the staff was great, not one person working looked miserable everyone was genuinely nice and friendly and happy to be welcoming you in this establishment \n\nMenu is easy to read and descriptions are spot on \n\nWe tried some tapas for starters \n\nWe had the \"zi Klong moo io\" which is garlic pepper spare ribs \n\nSo tender and flavorful !\n\n& we also tried the Thai wings that were flavored with garlic mint cilantro , never had that combination and I didn't know I needed to eat it  it was another hit \nThe chicken wings were big and freshly cooked and perfectly seasoned chicken \n\nThey had specials that night everyone including my friend got a different meal , my friend who has become a regular recommended a dish which is her favorite the \"Kai Yang \" which is grilled marinated chicken that is served with papaya salad and sticky rice , she loves the sauces that come with this meal I tried the green sauce which is her favorite \" \n\n My husband had the \"Thai fried rice \"he had chicken and shrimp for protein ! I took a bite of his meal and on of the best fried rice bites I ever tried b \n\n\nAs for me I had the Chicken pad Thai ! \nI'm living in NY we have a lot of Thai restaurants that are a hit or miss and I was exited to come to this one to try the chicken pad Thai and it was a perfect 10/10 for me \nThe noodles were perfectly\nCooked , and the sauce was a abundant my noodles did not get dry and had more than enough chicken in my meal,the flavor over all was unique , full of flavor and exactly what a Pad Thai dish should always taste like when ordering ! If your a sucker for Pad Thai you need to try Tuk Tuks ! \n\n\nWe ended the night with some dessert I had the deep fried cheese cake cake with a coconut ice cream on the side which was a perfect touch and waitress recommended strawberry jam vs the raspberry that was in the description ! \n\nEverything was honestly delicious and I almost forgot to mention my new favorite drink the Thai ice tea ! I had two  this was such a great dining experience \n\n\nThe food was excellent the company I was in was so great and honestly the restaurant was excellent we enjoyed ourselves so much w didn't realize how the time was passing and just felt so comfortable and in peace \n\n\nPlease if you are in Atlanta and want some delicious Thai food do not skip over this place they are a gem\n\nLocation is clean even the bathroom is so beautiful and decorated and plant life thriving !",

Personally I don't like sweet meat so there was that. I ordered a side car, the glass was a coup glass but a very very small one, then I seen the other cups were just a lot bigger for the same price. So. That kind of annoyed me..the server was alright, a bit snarky. And the biggest disappointment was the rice. I ordered Thai fried rice with chicken and shrimp. There was NOTHING fried about it. It came out with some sweet flavor in it already and some strange looking chicken slivers, and everything was like undercooked and more slimy. So, I just figured for 40 bucks I would be full and at least get my moneys worth which I feel like I did not. I would maybe try again just to see the difference but I was not pleased.",

I ordered the Lunch Box Special which came with a a soup, rice and two entrees. I had a chicken dish which was just ok. The chicken was over cooked and tough. I prefer thigh meat when it comes to stews and saucy dishes and it seems like the used chicken breast which made the meat so tough. The vegetables were undercooked. The cabbage was so hard and there were huge chunks of everything. The food was mostly sweet, I wasn't really impressed. I've had better Thai from takeout spots. \n\nI would go back with a group and try some other stuff, but I'm not in a rush to go back.",

        "text": "I was excited to visit this restaurant for a friend's birthday dinner. We were a party of 12 and the server was very attentive and timely with everything from taking orders to delivering drinks. The Mai Tai cocktail I ordered was very delicious and fruity. I then ordered a few appetizers instead of a entree since I was not that hungry. The shrimp tempura was very crispy and juicy and the sauce was an added bonus. The Thai basil wings were alot bigger then I expected but were crunchy and cooked to perfect, I also really loved the fried garlic on top. Overall, I had a great night and would definitely visit again.",

Signature dish for a Thai or call it the most popular in Thailand is tum yum Kung soup. The taste at Tuk Tuk was as authentic as it gets and just as tasty. Of course less spicy, but that should be expected. We ordered a bunch of chicken and prawn entres. Each one was very tasty. We ordered 2 deserts, one was fried custard and other had sticky rice with coconut ice cream. The contrast in taste with salt, coconut and sweet sticy rice was just perfect. The bill given the location, ambience was surprisingly low. I think this is the best thai food we have eaten in USA.",

        "text": "I'm starting this with a two star and hope that if we return, the service and food will be on par to the photos displayed by the owner. \n\nWe live just down the street and decided to give Tuk Tuk a try since we love Thai food. The place is super cute and love the entry with their scooter and the decorations. You take the elevator to the second floor. The hostess was pleasant and we bellied up to the bar because that is what we prefer because we get close and intimate when we share meals together. The ambiance is wonderful in the restaurant section with the Edison lights on the ceiling. \n\nWhen we sat at the bar, there were two other couples almost finished with their meal, and three bar staff. We were greeted and given menus. No silverware, napkins, or chopsticks given. Had to ask for chopsticks when the food started arriving. All the bar staff were totally engaged with each other or on their phones most of the night and the service was horrible. Luckily, the cocktails weren't too terribly disappointing. \n\nUnfortunately, the food presentation was not nearly as beautiful as what the owner posted (the reason why we were enticed to try). Food is all about presentation and I can overlook it if the service is excellent. The flavors did not work and everything was super sweet tasting, including my chicken coconut soup. We ordered the spinach wrap app and some dumplings, the salmon dinner (which was lukewarm), and I ordered the soup for my meal. I couldn't even finish the soup because it had such a sour taste like sour milk. It was super sweet as well. Everything came out fairly quick but tepid in temperature. The green beans were literally raw, which thankfully my boyfriend didn't as okay with. The salmon was a decent size but the skin was super soggy. \n\nI asked for a napkin and the guy bartender gave me napkins from the cocktail holder with the straws. Hell, I could have gotten that myself but we wanted napkins. We both sat at the bar with two empty glasses and it took 20 mins (I timed it because I was ready to leave at this point) before I finally just asked for another cocktail round. Seriously?  How does bar staff see two empty drinks and not ask if we wanted another one? That's because they were all busy on their phones.  Wish I had taken a photo. \n\nMy boyfriend said he would be willing to give it another try, but to spend over $150 and get poor quality of food and terrible service, not sure I'm willing to give it another go. We do not mind spending money on food because we are foodies but this was a total disappointment all the way around and it's unfortunate because we thought we might have stumbled upon our little \"regular\" place like we had in Buford. \n\nMaybe the table service is better?",

We started off with a lychee martini and the beef skewers, both were delicious! The skewers were marinated and topped with a sweet glaze that I enjoyed and cooked to perfection. We also got the roti. Ir says it comes with a spicy green curry, but it wasn't spicy to me. I am a huge roti fan, so I would definitely recommend and the presentation was awesome. I got the massaman curry, which was pretty good. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again. While the prices were reasonable, i thought the portions were small. The fried cheesecake was a deeeelicious dessert! On the way back down to the parking lot, a lady stopped us and told us that if we hadn't tried the honey pepper ribs, we missed out. I'll definitely try them next time I visit. The inside is nicely decorated and there was a large crowd there on a Friday night. My mom and i were excited to be able to sit outside too.",

Their food is spectacular and comforting. You can tell it is very well thought out down to each vegetable, protein, seasoning and sauce. Their Pad Thai and Pad See Ew are excellent as well as their Kao Pad Goong Chiang (Thai Fried) which is my absolute favorite. The restaurant itself has a modern, higher end vibe, yet is not too much so that it's unapproachable. I would recommend it for special occasions or a week night treat alike. I often do takeout just for the food when I need a pick me up. Tuk Tuk is absolutely one of those Atlanta places that you need to check out!",

        "text": "Had a really great experience for a late Sunday night meal! Walked in with no reservation and were able to sit at a high top right away, but there were no spots open for a regular table. \n\nTo start off - they have a gluten free menu available upon request!\n\nStarted with the Satay Kai which was chicken skewers served with a sweet chili sauce and cucumber salad. I would highly recommend this as a small plate/starter. Sometimes chicken skewers can get dry because of how thin they are, but these were perfectly cooked. Veggies were also very fresh.\n\nFor entrees we split the Massaman Curry and the Chicken Pad Thai. Both were EXCELLENT. The one thing I would change is that the curry could've used an extra serving of rice with it, so I would recommend ordering another side of the rice to accompany it if you want enough to soak up all the sauce. \n\nWe finished with the chocolate cake which was not listed on the menu. I had asked the waitress if they had any gluten free desserts when she came over to ask if we wanted to see a dessert menu, and this is what she recommended. It's a VERY dense fudge cake so we got a box to take the rest home after a very filling meal. \n\nService was a tad slow at times (we waited for the cake slice for 20+ min) but our server was very kind and tried to be as attentive as possible given the # of customers she had in her area. \n\nI will definitely be returning to this spot, and look forward to checking out the other Thai restaurants in the area that they own.",

We got the following as takeout (which did not deter from the tastiness of the food!)\n\nTldr: try the skewers and rib appetizers! The noodle dishes are flavorful but somewhat lacking in other ingredients like protein or vegetables.\n\nNuea Sawan: very savory jerky. Softer than typical beef jerky and a lot more flavor. Would recommend as a shareable.\n\nZi Klong Moo: HIGHLY Recommend! Soft tear off the bone ribs with a strong garlic and soy sauce flavor.\n\nThap Kai: grilled chicken liver another recommend! A nice char on the liver and does not taste sandy as some other livers do. The sticky rice pairing makes for a perfect balance of savory and slightly sweet.\n\nSatay Kai: would recommend if you've never had good chicken satay! Meat is tender and not dry with a great lemongrass flavor! Nutty sauce pairs well. Not as strong in flavor as other appetizers but tastes good nonetheless.\n\nBa Mee Moo Dang: very flavorsome noodles that have nice balance of acidic and nutty. Only complaint was the protein was 2 flimsy pieces of bbq pork that were sour and did not really complement the noodles.\n\n Beef Pad see ewe: nice savory noodles. The protein was much more plentiful in this dish and went well with the noodles. Did not have a lot of vegetables and was a little too salty but overall a decent dish.",

        "text": "Yes, yes, yes please and thank you Awesome Thai restaurant  with an elevated loft experience. \n\n First of all you have to take an elevator to the second flour where you step into a beautiful loft style restaurant.  The bar screams \"sit and drink here\"! Beautiful bar lots of Asian influenced decorartions. It's a great spot for date night, girls night, happy hour or just want to dress up and eat somewhere nice.  It hit all cylinders for me. The service was great. We had a great server and he even got me wait for it.... GLUTEN FREE Calamari!!! What! YES! NEVER have I ever had a place make GF Calamari just for me. I was super excited and it was yummy!! \n\nThe drinks,, The drinks, I had the Tuk Tuk Martini and I had to restrain myself at 2!! \n\nI had spring rolls that were wrapped in rice paper,  they had soo many GF options I was like jackpot!! I could eat just about anything on the menu and that\n just sent me to total sensory overload. GF options,  good food, good service, good conversation with good friends lots of laughter. It was loud enough that our laughter was not too roudy. But we could have stayed there all night. The ambiance and vibe was everything!  I highly recommend this place. This is a next time I'm in ATL I will make a beeline here but not too early because they don't open until 530 but it's work the wait to skip lunch and go hungry and thristy!",

The servers are always polite, knowledgeable about the menu and offering up the best suggestions!\n\nThis location is perfect for small business lunches and quaint date nights in the evening. The vibe in the day is:  bright, natural light, and refreshing. The vibe at night is: low lighting, intimate, and perfect for good conversation. \n\nThe food is amazingly fresh, and the menu has great options and not too many, so it's easy to make your mind up and order. Their rice is my favorite! \n\nThe drinks are nice, lunch is affordable and depending on what you order $20 will get you a decent meal. For date night, expect to spend $50 at minimum for two people ordering tapas. Main courses, take it up a bit. The prices, food quality and service are all aligned. Don't pass up Tuk Tuk, please go and enjoy yourself!\n\nFree and ample parking.",

Anything on the menu is great but my favorite thing to order for dinner is a combo of things from the tapas menu. The Kanom Jeeb, Roti, Satay Kai and Thai samosas are amazing to share among the table. That and a bottle of wine sealed the deal for me I didn't even get pictures . \n\nMy friends got the Pad See Ewe and the Pad Thai and they enjoyed their meals thoroughly. I'm always satisfied with the service, the recommendations , friendliness , the timeliness in delivery between appetizers and main course . \n\nCan you tell I love this place and love taking all my friends here?",

It our waiter who took our experience over the moon!! Max!!! This man took time to go over the menu on grave detail, took note of our dietary restrictions, and was patient at every step. We were to celebrate both my and my mother's birthda. The manager brought me the cutest magnet! My brother expressed that it was also my mother's birthday, and he made sure to bring her a cute keychain as well to commemorate the occasion. The cherry of the night was when he took us to the balcony and gave us an entire photoshoot!!! When you go, make sure to ask for Max (the pastry chef) by name! He will take great care of you!",

Overall, I would give this place another try as they have the potential of having 5 stars. Appetizers were savory and bright. Entrees were fresh and vibrant as well. Outdoor area offers great views and the indoor decor is beautiful. The drinks were the highlight of the show. They definitely got that right. Our server was very attentive and the manager came over to make sure everything was up to par. I would return even if it was just for drinks or another girls night.  They have ample parking so don't have to worry about valet or parking in a garage.",

I've actually come to love this place so much that I've introduced a few coworkers to Tuk Tuk, and they now love Tuk Tuk, too! \n\nSome of my favorites:\n- Nuah Ping $10 - Grilled skewered beef tenderloin with tamarind chili sauce\n- Pad Zee U $15 - Chicken, beef or pork sautéed with flat rice stick noodles, eggs and Chinese broccoli in black soy sauce\n- Kra Pow Moo $14 - Sautéed minced pork with Thai sweet basil and garlic, topped with a fried egg served with jasmine rice\n- Kao Moo Dang $15 - BBQ pork and Thai sausage served over jasmine rice topped with herb sauce and a hardboiled egg served with black soy sauce.\n- Lychee Martini $10 - Vodka shaken with lychee juice and lychee fruit - a Thai favorite!\n\nI will say that sometimes they are swamped and if you're sitting in a weird spot, service is a bit spotty. Otherwise, most experiences with service here have been very positive. \n\nThis place has definitely grown on me. Will continue to come back time and time again!",

Pretty regular no dry seasoning and they had a Thai chili dipping sauce. Not bad though I think many would find them good. I just thought they were okay. The calamari was my favorite. There was this sweet but spicy green dipping sauce that was fantastic. \n\nNot pictured unfortunately but I had their mild yellow curry. It's good light not too heavy or thick. I personally just didn't favor the large cut onions and prefer bell pepper. The pad Thai my friend got was delicious.",
