We had the charred cauliflower app and I wasn't expecting it to be sauced but it was very good. Enough for 3 if you're not starving. I got the Mediterranean salad as my entree and it was a good size. My sister got the ancient grains bowl and my mom got the Panang curry. It was all delicious! And reasonably priced. All of our food and teas came to about $95.

We ordered the sparkling apricot tea, sparkling prickly pear tisane, spaghetti squash casserole with chicken sausage, and the teriyaki quinoa bowl. The drinks were very refreshing and the food was fulfilling, as well as delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed True Kitchen and will be back in the near future.",

        "text": "As a frequent visitor to True Food, I've always enjoyed my dining experiences here, which makes my recent visit all the more disappointing.\n\n(It's important to note that the food was good, as it has always been, and my critique is strictly regarding the service experience.)\n\nHaving worked in the service industry for several years, I understand the pressures and demands of the job quite well. This perspective makes me sympathetic to the challenges faced by servers, yet it also confirms my belief that the level of service I received at True Food was objectively subpar and not up to the standards of any dining establishment.\n\nUpon arrival, the service was startlingly indifferent. There was no greeting, and the only way I learned our server's name (Milan) was by glancing at her name card. Her approach lacked the basic courtesy I've come to expect not just at True Food, but in any dining establishment. Instead of a welcome, or even a Hello, she quickly asked if we wanted drinks, leaving us quite taken aback.\n\nHoping this was just an off moment, I waited for an improvement. Unfortunately, the service did not get better. When taking our order, there was no engagement, no recommendations, and no inquiry about potential allergies - just a straightforward request for our order. This lack of interaction was both surprising and disappointing.\n\nThe service continued to be lacking throughout our meal. Our server was absent for extended periods, over 20 minutes at one point, and we were left without basic necessities like straws, seasoning or ketchup the *entire meal. \n\nWe didn't receive a *single* check-in to see if everything was satisfactory or if we needed anything.\n\nTowards the end of our meal, she briefly appeared to offer to-go boxes, no desert, and then quickly left again. \n\nNotably, she attended to the table next to us with providing them with ketchup that we had been waiting for. Keep in mind, this was for another servers table. This discrepancy in service led me to feel uncomfortable and question the nature of this differential treatment...\n\nI am reluctant to jump to conclusions about the reasons behind this disparity in service, but it's disheartening to even consider that it might be related to bias or stereotyping. No customer should even have to feel they are being treated differently due to their appearance.\n\nI sincerely hope this was an isolated incident and not reflective of a deeper issue within the restaurant. True Food has always been a place I enjoyed, and it's disheartening to have such a negative experience. I believe in constructive feedback and hope that my review can contribute to improving the service for all patrons.",

        "text": "So glad we finally got to try the Atlanta location of True Food Kitchen. We went several years ago in Houston, and loved the large selection of healthy dishes, and this was very similar. The location at Lenox is humongous, with plenty of seating indoors and outdoors on a nice patio (where we sat). We were running some errands on a Friday night, and this was a treat to end the errands with.\n\nWe both enjoyed bowls, and my glass noodle bowl was delightfully spicy (just a hint, not overwhelmingly so). We loved that next to the cocktail menu they have a refreshers and tea menu. You can still drink something fun and delicious without alcohol if you are in a healthier mood (or if you're pregnant). The flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert was the true highlight of the meal. Just perfection. Can't wait to come back when we're in the area!",

        "text": "This wasn't my first time at True Food Kitchen, I've been a few times before. I enjoy coming to True Food, because the food always tastes so good, and it's honestly healthy too. I got the chicken sausage pizza and the spaghetti squash casserole with chicken sausage. The casserole was brought out first on accident, because the server must've misheard me when I said I wanted the chicken sausage pizza. Personally I didn't like it too much, I'm not as big fan of squash, so it was whatever to me. The pizza was excellent though. It was crispy and quite flavorful. I ended up having about 3 slices to take back home. I would definitely get it again. For my drink, I got a spicy pineapple margarita. It was really good and had a good balance to it. I would've given 5 stars for my rating, but the service was quite slow (they took forever for one of my friends' drink) and then they didn't even get my order right. They did comp the casserole though, (I asked to make sure I didn't get charge if I ate it.) Overall, True Food Kitchen is a great place to grab dinner or even lunch. I also think they started doing brunch recently as well. You also have the option to sit outside too (that's what I did when I went with some friends.) The menu has tons of options too, so you're bound to find something that you will enjoy. Don't hesitate to ask your server about the menu either!",

I've been to this location twice as well as the one in Alpharetta and another one in Chicago. \n\nThe food is always fresh and you know exactly how many calories are in everything which is super helpful when you are counting calories. \n\nMy friend and I came to this location yesterday. We shared two appetizers -- the Tuna Tostada and the Herb Hummus. Both were delicious and very fresh. The hummus came with fresh cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, olives, and feta. This really helped to elevate the dish. The combination of the crunchy veggies with the salty feta and olives along with the smoothness of the hummus was divine. We loved it and would get it again. The tuna tostada was also very good. Well seasoned and fresh. \n\nFor our mains, I got the chicken sausage pizza with roasted fennel and a side kale salad. The chicken sausage was very flavorful and the crust had a nice fluffiness to it without being too thick. The kale salad was very fresh and well dressed. It was a nice addition to the pizza.  My friend had the noodle bowl with salmon. She said she really enjoyed it.\n\nFor drinks we both had Prickly Pear margaritas. We both loved that all of their cocktails are under 300 calories so there was no guilt in the indulgence. \n\nThe service was great. Our waiter Steve gave us lots of great recommendations. Also the decor of this place is beautiful. \n\nThis place has healthy and whole foods that you will honestly enjoy and not just tolerate. If you've never been here you should definitely check it out.",

We ordered all vegan options and our meal was nothing less than greatness! \n\nThey have several vegan options available. I can't wait to try them all! Lol\n\nKale Aid - kale, ginger, apple, celery, cucumber, lemon. Loved this! Strongest flavors were the kale and celery. Can't say that I'd order it again. At $9 a pop with no refills, it wasn't worth it for me. \n\nSparkling Prickly Pear Tisane - prickly pear, hibiscus, lime. I wasn't really a fan, but my guys liked it. $5\n\nEdamame Guacamole - Interesting but in a good way. Edamame seems like an unnecessary add because guac doesn't need anything added to its amazing taste but it was still good. \n\nAncient Bowl - miso sesame glazed sweet potato, turmeric, charred onion, snap pea, portobello, avocado, hemp seed, cilantro pumpkin seed pesto. Added tofu for $4, which was worth it to me! It came with the same sauce that was on the sweet potatoes, which was hecka tasty with a lil kick! Can't say that all the ingredients was tied together well in the bowl but I loved the combination. I'm also a person who loves to eat random foods together, so there's that! \n\nSpinach and Mushroom Pizza - organic spinach, roasted mushroom, garlic purée, caramelized onion, house-made vegan almond ricotta, aleppo chili. Tasty!! The ricotta had a pretty dominant presence, which I didn't mind at all! The chili (powder) had a good bit of heat to it. Not that spicy to the tongue kinda heat, but the karate chop to the back of your throat for the first taste. \n\nVegan Double Cheeseburger - house-made with portobello, walnut, beet, lettuce, pickled onion, organic tomato, vegan cheddar, vegenaise, flaxseed bun. Interesting, again in a good way. Doesn't give you the traditional burger feel if that's what you're looking for but was so good! I would have loved some type of sauce or some yellow mustard on it but still delicious! Ordered with half spinach/sweet potatoes. Not a fan of the kale and all it's bitterness. \n\nVegan strawberry cheesecake - I wasn't a fan of this at all. I'm picky about cheesecake and this wasn't it. The crust was good but the cheesecake wasn't quite executed. It almost had a savory taste, which is a no go. The bite with the fresh strawberry was better. It lacked a natural sweetener.",

Parking is easy as it is just using the Lenox mall parking lot over by Nike and on the side as well. The overall service is pretty quick and for a Friday night the place was fairly empty. You can choose indoor or outdoor seating. \n\nI highly recommend getting a refresher and I loved the limeade as mine personally. I will also say the teriyaki quinoa bowl is one of my favorites and you can add a protein (I personally chose chicken) but I wish they would give you more than one slice of avocado especially for the price point.",

They focus on using whole ingredients such as natural sweeteners and it showed! We ordered appetizers, dinner, and dessert, and we loved all of it. It wasn't anything special or amazing, but everything tastes great. \n\nThe service was good. Nothing to complain about, but nothing memorable. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very pretty. Very cool and uniquely designed. On warm nights I recommend sitting out on their outdoor patio at Lenox Mall.",

I love getting this with a salad on the side and it makes for the perfect lunch meal. Every time I come here the servers are kind, and there is great light streaming through windows which is important to me when I'm having lunch.

Parking is free of course if you choose not to valet. \n\nWe came by on Monday at lunch time and even then it was busy. However, we were seated immediately with a server greeting us soon after. The menu is seasonal and fresh sticking with the \"true food\" theme. Prices however... are hefty (but probably about the same as other Buckhead restaurants). We split a panini and turkey burger which was amazing. I have had the curry here which was veggie packed and very fresh. Definitely a great option if you are looking to eat healthier in the area.

I love it even when I'm not fasting.\nThey a lot of what I needed & little of the temptations. I brought an herbivore friend to try them out and they loved it! \nParking: easy/free/mostly safe - Lennox Mall\nCus.Service: professional but it can be a lil dry unless one of the 'gworls' is helping\nAmbiance: good for families, groups, solos\nQuality: Excellent quality \nMenu: My go-to is the burger. If you ask they can deconstruct it for you. \n\nIf you're looking for health-focused vegan food or to break away from wings and fried things, or to just enjoy a nice ambiance and pleasantries, grab a bite here!",

        "text": "I was a regular at the TFK in Bethesda, MD where the food & service never disappointed. Here, I really didn't feel the same, as the service started out good, yet it when became a little busier it decreased.\n\nThe Herb Hummus was good per usual. I haven't been to TFK since January 2020, so I took advantage of their new Vegan Double Cheeseburger, where I was not disappointed. The portobello, walnut, beet, & kuzu patty was a different combination, yet tasty. The pickled onions & housemade Vegenaise Remoulade rounded out the Vegan concept. My Niece's Turkey Burger was a little dry as with my Grand Nephew's Burger. Definitely will pass on the Watermelon Lemonade as it lacked the normal sweet melon aspect. \n\nAs a patio lover, the layout & covering work. However, the patio's furniture was disgusting. You can feel the coils when sitting down in addition to the dirty, dingy coverings. \n\nI don't recall TFK prices being this steep, as we didn't get the bang for the bucks. More importantly, we are still amongst a Pandemic, the lack of cleaning & sanitizing was too evident during our lunch. We had to ask for new dishes & ultimately ended up using plastic utensils. \n\nOne & done.",

The name of the dish is Teriyaki Quinoa Bowl which you would expect Quinoa to be the main grain but it's not, it's brown rice with a sprinkle of quinoa. \n\nThe issue with this is as a vegan who doesn't eat or buy brown rice as it does not digest the same as quinoa it's a problem.  I can do a sprinkle of brown rice, but not the other way around. Quinoa doesn't make me bloated, but brown rice does. The name of the dish should be updated as quinoa is not the main grain for those who typically stand clear of brown rice or prefers a small amount. \n\nThe menu does not even shown brown rice as a second ingredient so I'm not sure why the entire bowl is mainly brown rice it's false advertisement in my opinion. \n\nHere's how it reads on the menu. Broccoli, rainbow carrot, bok choy, green bean, snap pea, pickled shiitake, brown rice, avocado, Chef Matt's Magical Dust V GF. I didn't see broccoli at all but I sure did see the main grain being brown rice. \n\nI would recommend the name of this bowl be changed as brown rice is nothing like quinoa. Quinoa is an ancient grain while brown rice is not. \n\nPlease change your menu name to a brown rice bowl with a sprinkle of quinoa because that's what it is.",
