That said, they get by on name brand. \n\nThe steak was cooked perfectly, but lacked seasoning or flavor\n\nThe truffle mashed potatoes lacked seasoning and had a odd consistency, they were not fluffy or soft.\n\nThe mushrooms were horrible and chewy \n\nService was slow, for a meal of this caliber and compared to other steakhouses in the area it was disappointing. For the money, Little Alley is a better selection",

        "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for a while but it was very underwhelming. We had a reservation for five at 8:30pm on a Friday. The entire party arrived on-time, however, we weren't seated until 9pm which is the time that the restaurant closes. I was seated in the isle but was not a fan because people were bumping into me as they were walking past the entire night. We ordered our food and it didn't come for about 45minutes.  Which means we didnt eat until an hour after closing.\n\nWe ordered Two steaks, short ribs, fish, Foie Gras, Grit fritters, asparagus and mashed potatoes. Both of the steaks were undercooked and 4/5ths of the table agreed that the food was underwhelming. Once the steaks came back, they were tough and the potatoes were flavorless. The things we enjoyed were the Grit Fritters, I liked the Foie Gras and the person that ordered the fished enjoyed it. \n\nI also wasn't a fan of our primary server, Trevor. He mentioned that he had been drinking and was visibly annoyed whenever we requested something. He also ended up comping the two steaks because he admitted that they were undercooked since he put the order into the kitchen late and rushed the chef to get them out to the table. When orders go into the kitchen late, the entire table suffers because we all got our food late. He gave us free dessert but I personally don't eat sweets so it didn't really mean much to me.  Our server gave us our checks and left before we could even pay. We had to flag another server down to check us out.\n\nThe server John, that checked us out was far nicer and I have a feeling that we would've enjoyed our dinner more if he had've been our server the entire night. John is the only reason why I might try this place again. He was really great. I might come back but I would sit at the bar or anywhere else besides Trevor's section.",

Their steaks are the highest quality and most importantly for me, never overcooked. I came with a group of people and for appetizers we ordered the beef carpaccio, foie gras, the wedge salad and another salad with apples in it. I'm a huge fan of wedge salad in general so that was delicious! The beef carpaccio was amazing as well. I didn't care for the foie gras that much because it was too sweet for me, but that's just personal preference.\nFor the main dishes, we got two different kinds of steak, a T-bone and something else but they were so wonderful. I'm a huge carnivore and this really satisfied the carnivorous side of me haha. \nFor dessert, we got the pecan pie and a chocolate mousse cake thing. Both were wonderful! The pecan pie was so warm and the pecans were still a little crunchy and not soggy. I loved the chocolate raspberry cake because it wasn't sweet at all! I didn't feel terrible after eating it. \nOverall, such a great experience and if I'm ever craving meat, I would definitely come here again!",

If you're trying to save money this is not the restaurant for you, but it is great for a special occasion, but I did get a little wide-eyed when we got the bill. Ha! It did not help that my husband is a wine snob and ordered 2 glasses of $100/glass wine. It still tasted terrible to me, but I also don't care for wine so I'm definitely not the person to be giving accurate wine reviews. He ordered two of them so it could not have been terrible. :)\n\n\nWe went around the New Year and it did not disappoint. It's rated the #1 steakhouse in Atlanta for a reason. The \"Bones\" salad is outstanding - probably the best salad I've ever had. The husband isn't a salad person so he always makes fun of me when I order salads when we are out, but this salad really, really is worth the purchase. My husband ordered a steak (NY strip) I order dry aged, bone in ribeye. Both were cooked to perfection. We also ordered two sides  (shareable!) - corn pudding (another must have) and asparagus (nothing special about it, it was cooked well). \n\nService was definitely on par with what you'd expect for this type restaurant. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. Reservations are a must!",

        "text": "Environment: The look of the restaurant is definitely along the lines of your classic American steakhouse. There are lots of wood and brass features and the décor is a bit dated. However, you still get the upscale ambience and I liked the location of the big bar as the main centerpiece.\n\nFood/Drink: Ordered the Grilled Baby Octopus with Fennel Salad as an appetizer. The entrées were the Seared Scallops with Swiss Chard, Wild Mushrooms and Bones Bacon and the Red Snapper with Sea Beans in a Sun Dried Tomato Vinaigrette. And to round it out, ordered the Sautéed Green Beans, Truffle Butter Mashed Potatoes, Sautéed Mushrooms for accompanying sides. Had a couple glasses of red wine to drink.\nAll of the food was delicious! They definitely know what they're doing over here.\n\nService: Honestly, the service was nothing to write home about (at least IMO for this visit). It wasn't bad, but nothing about the server was memorable in terms of friendliness or going above and beyond to further my experience. I received everything I ordered so I guess that's what really matters right?\n\nIn summary, I had been wanting to check out Bones for years and am finally happy to say I can cross that off my list. The food was on point and lived up to the hype so, that alone is definitely worth a return trip.",

The service was efficient, professional and top notch, the drinks were tasty and the food was phenomenal. We started with Smoked Salmon & Shrimp Cocktail appetizers - then moved to the Wagyu for our entree. The Wagyu was like butter! Our sides were the collard greens and baked potatoe. We ended the meal with Berry compote cheesecake and pecan pie. I would definitely recommend this establishment. I've had the pleasure of visiting 7 out of 10 Zagat Top Ten Fine Dining restaurants and they are deserving of their 4.8 rating for sure.",

        "text": "We decided to stop in Sat night after the chaos at the airport 11/20/21. They were full for the evening and weren't accepting anymore reservations so we sat at the stools facing the mirror for cocktails only until searing at the bar became available. They put our name on the waitlist as we ordered our drinks.\n\nThe service at the bar was good even on a busy Saturday evening.\n\nStarted w/ old fashioned, good but needed 1 cube \n\nThe bisque was good but had a bite to it. You can see from the picture there are bits of lobster in there. There was even larger chunks in the soup itself.\n\nBe careful not to get full on the warm bread & butter\n\nI ordered the mixed grill and requested medium+ for the temperature. It came out more medium or even less warm that that. I will put it in the air fryer for a minute to bring it to the temperature I need it to be. All the meats aside from the pheasant sausage needed a dash of salt.\n\nMy husband ordered the loin lamb chops and was pleased with the order. They are huge and had a good grill flavor to them. They could used a dash of salt or not.\n\nThe truffle butter mashed potatoes were very good, though a little crumbly in texture.\n\nI enjoyed the grilled asparagus, not pictured here. They are larger spears and still had a slight crunch to them. There was a perfect amount of char on them.\n\nThe pecan pie was nuked too long in the microwave. It tasted overcooked and the chocolate had that burnt taste to it. I had to cleanse my palette with one of the cheese wafers.\n\nBones is an Atlanta staple. I'll be back.",

        "text": "We were on vacation in Atlanta visiting family, it was my bf's bday week so I made a reservation with OpenTable with Bones. We had a reservation for 4 adults. I am not sure if they take walk-ins so I just recommend making a reservation. \n\nWe were welcomed with a decorated table for bf's bday (I put a note for bday on reservation). A lot of reviews advised to get the Lobster Bisque... I was not impressed... I wish I would have got the French Onion (which bf did get) and it was SO good... \n\nThey have a bone-in filet mignon (which I didn't know was a thing) because the filet doesn't have a lot of fat, the bone apparently adds TONS of flavor to the cut. I went with my go to Rib-eye, which was perfectly cooked.\n\nThe sides are big enough to share for four, I chose the truffle mashed potatoes (SO good), we also got Mac & Cheese, and bf got himself a classing baked potato. Everyone loved the mac & cheese but those truffle mashed potatoes were out of this world! \n\nThey gave us a delicious layered ice cream cake dessert. It had rum raising, chocolate, vanilla, and it was SO yummy and it was so kind that it was complimentary! They have an extensive wine/spirits list if you're into that thing.",

The menu doesn't change often and the decor is a bit dated but that's part of the charm I imagine. \n\nWe had a large party and used a private room downstairs. Service was great, the team was very attentive and made great recommendations. We enjoyed martinis to start and then migrated to Pinot noir. The table enjoyed the filet, rib eye, crab stuffed trout, truffle mashed potatoes(delicious), mushrooms, wedge salad, avocado and crab salad(yum), and more!\n\nValet only, definitely make a reservation although eating at the bar looks like a good time as well.",

Some parts of our experience were great, and some were disappointing.\n\nFirst, we arrived early for our reservation but they were happy to seat us early once a seat became available. We waited in the bar area and were immediately offered drinks while we waited. This server was wonderful. I wish he was our server the whole time. Once we arrived at our table, I saw that they had decorated our table with little confetti because we were celebrating our anniversary. That made me smile the whole dinner!\n\nI ordered the French onion soup and filet, and my husband got the New York strip. We also got macaroni and cheese to share. The soup was good and macaroni and cheese was great. The steaks, unfortunately, just weren't. My filet seemed more like a sirloin in texture and was overcooked (almost medium well, yikes!). Admittedly, I was a little sad.\n\nThey were kind enough to give us a Mountain High Pie in celebration of our anniversary, which I thought was really nice. It was basically an ice cream cake. Tasty, but I don't think I would order it for myself in the future.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable dinner but I don't think it was worth the price.",

        "text": "I came with my boyfriend to celebrate a new job on a Friday evening. It was our first time at Bones and we've heard so much about this place so we were definitely excited. We made a reservation two weeks in advance since their weekend availability seems to be booked out pretty early. While we arrived 10 minutes early, the host was able to seat us immediately.\n\nWe ordered onion rings as an appetizer. FYI, you are apparently able to order half portions of this. The server offered the half portion, but we decided to order the full portion anyway and were shocked at how large the onion rings were! We also ordered a bone-in rib eye and a dry aged bone-in rib eye, both medium rare, and a side of truffle mashed potatoes. The bone-in rib eye was fine but half of the dry aged one was basically raw. At that point, it's too late to tell them that it isn't cooked properly. It's disappointing that a steakhouse would improperly cook a steak like this when this is what they specialize in. It was extremely hard to finish. \n\nThe service itself was impeccable and our waiter was courteous. I only wish that we were able to get our steak taken back sooner. We didn't tell them since half was eaten already. They clean your table and package leftovers in between courses. \n\nParking is valet only and complimentary, but you should definitely tip!",

        "text": "I'd say this is probably the best quality steak in Atlanta. There many other high-end places, but this one has received the most praise from every person I've come with. \n\nThe service is impeccable. Every waiter is incredibly knowledgeable about EVERY dish on the menu. I had questions about portion size, allergies, cooking oils, dietary restrictions. Our waiter throughly answered them all and went above and beyond to change certain dishes. I personally don't drink, but they had a very extensive wine list and the waiter even knew every wine! \n\nFor dessert, I recommend their Mountain High Pie!!",

The food was outstanding.  We brought our own cake but they also served us their signature dessert as well.  This was a 10 out of 10 in my book.  Perfect for special occasion.

However, the food, of which I had the NY Strip was far less than impressive.  The sweet potato casserole was half cooked and the mushrooms had no identity with respect to palatable flavor. Perhaps some of the other items are good but overall, I was nowhere near impressed by the food, but the ambiance and service were great. It was my birthday, and I was disappointed because I chose Bones and was not satisfied at the end of the meal.",

No matter what steakhouse I go to, I'm always mentally comparing my experience to the high bar that Berns's has set.\n\nAfter eating several steaks in Atlanta, I finally made my way to Bones, which was billed as a perfect Atlanta institution. I can see why. The steak was excellent. The French onion soup was excellent. The potato cake cooked in butter was amazing. The waiter was superb. Everything about the meal and service flowed smoothly.  If I had to rate this place from zero to 100, where zero is worst and 100 is Bern's, I'd give this place a 98. \n \nCOVID stuff: Visited December 2020. Staff wore masks.

The grilled octopus was prepared perfect extremely tender (not rubbery). The crab and lobster napoleon was to quote our son \"the best thing I have ever eaten!\"  For entrees we had the dry aged ribeye (the best!!), the strip and the bone in ribeye for two.  Always go for the aged beef, may cost more but is so much better.  Shared sides hash browns (the best), spinach and mushrooms. Shared desserts mountain high pie, key lime, and pecan pie (the winner!).  Such a classy, enjoyable atmosphere and staff!! You will LOVE this place!",

Bones staff members were on point and always around to to accommodate whatever we needed. \"Mark\" our head server has been there over 30 years and was a consummate professional. Steaks and appetizers were all very delicious. My only issue I had was that my stuffing in the trout dish I ordered was a tad fishy(we always order a steak and seafood dish to split if you're wondering why I order a fish dish at a steak house, ). They corrected that dish right away and everything thing else was phenomenal. Shout out to \"Ubee\" who took our reservation and got us in on a very busy Friday and put us a very nice room to ourselves. Bones is a go to if you're in Atlanta!",

Rodney was our waiter and 5 stars! He was fantastic. \n\nHowever the food was only okay. I really expected the food to be fantastic. For appetizers we got the onion rings they were yummy; it's hard to go wrong lol. We also got Crab and Lobster Napoleon with Chardonnay Cream it was good, very small portion and only good; Didn't blow my mind or taste buds. For my entree I got the lobster bisque and the crab and avocado salad. The lobster bisque went to waste, I couldn't eat it. I've had better soup out of a can it was salty , thick, strangely flavored , and no lobster; I would not recommend - so disappointed. My salad was good, would recommend. \n\nOn the table my boyfriend got the 20oz bone in rib-eye and added the herb and the Truffle Butter Mashed Potatoes he liked his steak. We've had better unfortunately. The potatoes we also very average I hoped they'd taste a bit more like truffle butter. My friend had the strip and it was almost well done so poorly cooked. Her sister had the stuffed trout which was the most delicious plate on the table! Please get that!!\n\nThe drinks were fabulous we had gimlets all around. Very delicious. And the ice cream cake was phenomenal. \n\nI would recommend. Not the best food in the city but the experience was nice. Cute for pre drinks.",

(They even exchange your napkin from the table for a clean napkin if you get up to use the facilities.)\nI haven't been treated this well in a restaurant in a long time (if ever!) \nNot to mention seeing everyone's smiling face and how much they seem to be enjoying their work!

This restaurant has A LOT of history behind it which made the experience a lot of fun.\nBefore our reservation we ordered a cocktail. I got the Bones Martini which has stuffed blue cheese olives in it. WOW was it good!!! My husband got the old fashioned. I am not a bourbon person but it was so good.\n\nWhen you sit down they provide you with a loaf of bread which is very fresh. You have to be careful because it's easy to eat the whole thing and not save room .\n\nFor appetizer I got the lobster bisque. Wow was it good. It reminded me of thanksgiving and was very hearty.\n\nFor dinner my husband got the bone in rib eye and I got the filet. If I could do it over again I would have done the bone in. It had a ton of flavor and was cooked perfectly. We also got a lobster tail to split. It was super juicy!!. \n\nThe service is immaculate and the people are very kind. I know it's a fancy restaurant but we have always helped stack it clean. They made a joke that if we do it again he's gonna give us a 1099 when we leave . \n\nFor dessert, we got the cheese cake and the pecan pie. For sure would get those again!\n\nThis place was awesome and we will be back.",

        "text": "My girlfriend gave me a choice between 3 great Atlanta-area steakhouses for my birthday dinner. I chose Bones. I've been to Bones once before and I was excited to revisit that experience. She made a reservation for the day before my birthday via OpenTable and was able to select that it was a special occasion on that platform.\n\nOnce at the restaurant, I utilized the complimentary valet service and we walked in. After a short wait, we were taken to our table which was downstairs. Since she booked on OpenTable, there was fun little confetti on the table. The party next to us had a birthday as well and they did not have confetti, so if you're planning a celebration, definitely check out OpenTable. \n\nI hadn't been downstairs before, but I really liked it. It felt more like a dining room than a restaurant. There were a couple of private dining areas for bigger groups down there that were fully utilized. It was a busy night at Bones!\n\nWe both started with a bourbon cocktail. She had the Kentucky Mule and I had the Bones Old Fashioned. Both were fantastic. \n\nIf you're thirsty for water, you won't be thirsty for long. The service staff is top notch here. Your water glass will never get to the half-empty point. Everyone works together on that team which is so great to see.\n\nWe opted to start with onion rings and I decided to get the French onion soup. The onion rings could easily get their own paragraph here. She liked this so much and said a few times how they're the best onion rings she's ever had. They weren't greasy at all. They were delicious. My French onion soup was really great too. Hard to go wrong on a chilly October night. \n\nOn to the meal. I wanted a glass of red with my filet and she opted for white wine with her vegetable plate. She had asparagus, broccoli, and hash browns. They were all delicious. I knew I wanted dessert so I didn't get a side. I was already feeling pretty full by now anyway. The steak I ordered was so great. It was cooked to perfection. \n\nOnce they took our plates, they mentioned they had a surprise coming out for us. To our surprise, they brought out a complimentary [huge] piece of their \"mountain high pie\" - a massive chunk of ice cream cake with meringue and a variety of flavors.\n\nAfter dinner they gave us one more little treat of shortbread cookies in a small to-go box that were shaped like bones. Very fitting. \n\nWe were both so impressed and we still talk about it often.",
