        "text": "I'm still thinking about these wings!\nWe had never been to this place until today. The vibe was great, the service was great, the food was great, we even got to see a birthday drink off (which was really cool and made me want to come back for my birthday) All around, It was truly a great outing! Just remember you have to be 21+ to come in at all times!\n\nThe funnel stick fries were delicious (not pictured) but were a great recommendation from our waitress for pairs to share!\n\nMy only \"con\" to this specific location is the parking situation. The lot directly across cost $15 to park and with both of us driving we spent $30 parking and $40 on food... it was definitely an expensive outing so my recommendation would be to carpool or park free on a nearby street and walk over.",

        "text": "My husband and I were craving some solid meaty burgers so we ordered take-out from Vortex. The order was ready fairly quickly and it was a positive pickup experience.\n\nLet's start with the burgers. We got one Classic Bypass (topped with a fried egg, American cheese, and bacon) and one Retro Diner Burger (2 sirloin patties, Swiss and Cheddar cheese, grilled onion, dill pickle). Everything was fresh and of good quality. The Retro Diner Burger was exactly what we expected. However, my Classic Bypass was very bland and slightly dry, lacking the smokey grill flavor as well. Overall it's quite different from when we visited in person pre-COVID.\n\nOn the positive side, we loved the Dixie Wrecked Taters, tator tots covered in sausage gravy, cheddar cheese, and bacon!! The potato salad, also has bacon and cheese, is to die for!\nI'd go back just for these.\n\nWe will give it another try when we go back to normal for sure!",

That said, I was looking for a post-workout protein fix before I crashed for the night and figured this would be as good of a place as any. This location has the same divey atmosphere I remember and I liked that they were checking people at the door. The menu has a huge selection of fancy burgers and I went with the guac version done medium rare. It was served to perfection with a good helping of fries. Service was attentive and I was even offered a to go cup for my Diet Coke. This would be a great place to stop back for dinner and drinks.

Mannnnn, after being in the restaurant for 90 mins somebody burst my window and went under my seat to steal my job's laptop that was prob worth $400-$500 that I need to use all the time. I'm a Firefighter/Paramedic serving and helping the community and barely making it to survive day to day and some sorry A$$ cost me more money than the laptop is worth. It cost $600 to replace my side windows.  The cop shows up in a timely manner and tells us ppl break in hundreds of cars ALL THE TIME in the parking lot and the cameras do NOT work... So I come out to enjoy a burger and end up spending over $600. I wonder why is t there a security guard posted up. These businesses make lots of $$$ and why aren't the cameras working. I'm 2022 operable Cameras are pretty cheap to installed and operate from an app but I guess the criminal minded person will continued to have a \"feast\" breaking in cars if no changes are being made. The burgers were great not worth the agony of worrying abt my car being harm.\nGee thanks. I should have gone to Burger King for a burger. . I won't be back..... EVER...",

Remember that it's 21+ no exceptions, and that the security guard will ID you at the front or at the table if no one is at the front.\n\nI don't often crave burgers, but if I do, Vortex really hits the spot. I got the 'KA'MANA WA'NA LEI'YA' which is a tropical burger that has a big glob of chipotle cream cheese, bacon, and pineapple jalapeño jelly. I could have gone with less chipotle cream cheese, but I guess it's for the aesthetic. Pineapple jalapeño jelly really slapped though! I found myself dipping my fries in the excess. \n\nAlso, this is one of the few places in Midtown that serves pickle fries and I'm always a sucker for those!\n\nThey have an extensive beer selection, and fun raunchy decor ranging from tame dusty license plates to playboy covers and a large dick statue at the front. It's almost always loud and dark inside and much hubbub going around. Have fun yall!",

Want to land yourself a hospital visit?Try the Triple Coronary Bypass burger estimated at over 7,000 calories! My friend and I weren't feeling that adventurous and opted for the holy guacamole burger and the black and blue. Both delicious, made fresh, and arguably the best burgers we've ever had! For our drinks we had mystery shots (bartenders choice) and beer. \n\nThis location also has a comedy bar in the back. I haven't been able to check it out yet but that's next on my bucket list!",

My frat brother invited me to grab lunch there and I love burgers so of course I was down. We parked on the street. It was a calm Saturday afternoon. \n\nThey ID at the front. That may be why I never went while I lived downtown in college. The location gave me bar/restaurant vibes. I ordered the Holy Guacamole with tater tots. It was fantastic. I believe that all of the burgers come with a side for the most part. I also ordered a 12 ounce IPA for like $5. The drinks were pretty cheap as well as the food. I paid for our lunch and spent $40. \n\nI definitely witnessed what the hype was about The Vortex. I will for sure be going back.",

Eh I've had some just as good but it is a great burger. \n\nThe fried zucchini and the sauce it came with definitely was much better than I thought it would be!

If you go at the right time, you can try their bypass burgers, which look insane. \n\nI didn't think much of this burger chain...it just looks like a dive bar serving pretty average food. But that definitely was not the case. \n\nClassic bypass burger: essentially a bacon cheeseburger but there's onions and pickles as well. The whole thing is huge, and I really had to squish the burger down just to take a bite. Gets messy so have plenty of napkins ready! Comes with a side and I got tater tots. Nothing really special about them. \n\nOff the deep end: apparently this is one of their strongest drinks. It comes with several different kinds of vodkas but you can't really taste it. Kind of dangerous! \n\nHighly recommend! But maybe share the dish with another person. Half of the burger definitely would've been enough for me.",

        "text": "We met some friends here for lunch on a Friday about noon. The place was not very busy but quickly filled up. I was the last one to arrive to meet my wife and our friends.\n\nThey already ordered and received their food and my wife ordered something for me when I told her I was on my way. When I arrived I went in and found them and the server came by. I placed an order for a beverage and she brought out my food. I saw that my wife had the peanut butter bacon burger which she loves. She said it was delicious. For me she ordered the Mac N Cheesy Changa appetizer. She knew it was right up my alley when she read it on the menu. It is BBQ pulled pork and macaroni and cheese wrapped up in a flour tortilla, deep fried, sliced and drizzled with more cheese. It looked delicious and tasted just as good.\n\nWe sat and chatted a while until we each had to be on our way. Overall it was a good experience. I would highly recommend trying either the peanut butter bacon burger or Mac N Cheesy Changa.",

Yes, it's good but it's not worth the craziness. \nWe had no wait on Sunday evening even though the hostess said the wait was 30 mins .. she ended up finding a few tables 2 minutes later. I've walked by before and the wait was over an hour and I would not wait that long to eat here having now eaten here. \n\nHowever, the decor is interesting such as the nudity and genitalia throughout. \n\nThe drinks are cheap. The food is average priced for a bar burger ~$12 but cheap if you consider you get bacon and other toppings. \n\nIt was really stuffy inside, people packed everywhere so definitely bar mentality. Too claustrophobic tbh. They allow smoking so don't breathe too deeply. \n\nParking available in lots nearby.",

Yea, that's never going to happen, however I did order the Apocalypse Burger, Boyfriend ordered the Bacon Mac and Cheese Burger. Both were absolutely phenomenal. Ordered wings as well, which were really spicy. I will absolutely come back for the burgers, probably not the wings though. \n\nOverall this place is super cool. I like the décor and the vibe a lot. It's very lively and entertaining. That being said, it can get a bit crowded, so if you're okay with a 20 minute wait, then you should give it a shot.

        "text": "This is a fun place to eat. In the middle of midtown where all the action is going on, you will see security at the entrance. They offer outdoor or indoor seating which includes a smoking section and non smoking. I found this odd that a restaurant still has a \"smoking\" section.\n\nAnyway when your first walk in, it's hard to miss the big penis statue on your way to your table. Needless to say this restaurant is not for children lol I would say their claim to fame is their burgers. We came here with a larger party and had to wait a little bit. Since people in our party were asthmatic we had to wait for non-smoking. \n\nThe burgers range from a boring plain burger to the Elvis burger. Of course I ordered the Elvis burger which includes peanut butter, plantains, and bacon with a beef patty. I did not get bacon with it, but of course I got everything else. I sat with people who all ordered boring plain burgers but they all said this was the best burger they have tasted (by the way it's not fun unless other ppl get an interesting burger with you IMO lol). \n\nYou can also swap out the patty's to satisfy your dietary needs. They even have an impossible vegan burger for those non meat eaters! You can swap out any patty for their different signature burgers or build your own. I liked the array of sides offered, but the premium ones have uncharges. This is definitely a great cheat spot for adults only fun. \n\nBy the way, they have a comedy club in the back!",

I ordered the hot wings and the nachos. The Buffalo wings sauce was very good. Best Buffalo wing sauce I've ever tasted. The blue cheese was very delicious taste like it was homemade. The sweet tea was okay it came in a 32oz cup lol. The nachos was tasty. I added chicken on it, chicken wasn't all that great. I probably coke back just for the wings and blue cheese",
