        "text": "I've been a frequent visitor to this location since the week it opened. Having gone to the originator--Prince's Hot Chicken Shack in Nashville--an Atlanta purveyor of Nashville Hot Chicken was welcomed.  \n\nToday, for the first time, I ordered a large white chicken mild.  My go to heat is either medium or hot but today I wasn't feeling anything to hot. When my order arrived, it looked as if the hot sauce had been poured across the chicken. I took the two chicken breasts up to the counter, and said that it just looked different to which they replied, OK.  They told me that that is how mild chicken is served. I told them that I had not ordered mild chicken at all. When I'd previously been there by myself or with family and friends, I'd only ordered medium or hotter so I had no idea. I'd figured the chicken would be coated like they coat medium and hotter chicken. \n\nThey asked what I would prefer, and I basically said give me the medium.   When they returned with the two chicken breasts, they were dripping with seasoning and they were oily which overpowered the heat.  I don't like food waste but I knew I could not eat what they'd served. I sent it back and requested mild and some sauce.  \n\nTheir manager returned to the table with one chicken breast, basically saying \"here's your order\".  I recapitulated the aforementioned story.  He listened and was also focused on my phone on one table and water bottle on another--I'd left them there as we were getting settled in. He said \"someone left their phone\". I told him it was mine. He then looked at the Fiji bottle then pointed to it asking if it was mine. \"Yes, it's my bottle\". Then he said \"oh three tables\" and commented about needing space for his customers.  It took another 8 minutes before my second chicken breast was delivered.   As I awaited my order it was apparent that I was not his customer. \n\nTwo servers offered impeccable service.  The manager on duty today did not.",

        "text": "Hot chicken is what you get here! I came on a Wednesday and there was no line. We parked right in the front and walked in. I ordered the chicken sandwich combo and my son had the tenders with fries and Mac. My flavor was mild and it was still hot so it definitely lived up to its name. The fries were tasty, fresh and seasoned. The mac was ok. As far as the sandwich itself, my chicken Brest was slightly dry and it's probably due to the size of the beast. The flavor wasn't anything special, hence why I gave it a three star. Seems that the emphasis is on the spice level instead of the actual flavor. I would say it's more so a tourist spot that's hyped up. When I told my friend who's from Atlanta about it, he said \"you had to see for yourself...chick fil-A is better.\" \n\nThe location was clean and the workers were friendly. The food came out fast! We ate outside and there were fans to keep us from melting in the summer heat. Would I recommend...probably not. To be honest, I like Scoville Hot chicken in Alpharetta way better.",

We really enjoyed out chicken sandwiches, chicken pieces, fried pickles and sides. But the staff makes the experience even better. Everyone was friendly, helpful and just genuinely nice and fun to be around.

        "text": "Mild to moderately obsessed with this place. I always order it to go (in advance) so I don't have to wait in line. There is always a line. I think I like this place the best because they have grilled chicken. You don't have to get the fried stuff (which I know is great, but not when you don't want something so heavy). It's the tenders for me. \nThree giant grilled tenders. Occasionally I'll get a wild hair and get one fried, 2 grilled. It's best to do this in person, though. Medium is usually hot enough for me. any hotter and it's just an uncomfortable eating experience, and I can't taste the flavor. It's just hot. So, mild or medium- plus the ranch. I get the bread on the side so it's not covered in the hot stuff. \n\nFor sides, I typically do double potato salad. This time, they had cheesy grits, so I tried those- yum! I don't like grits, but these were more of a potato than a grit to me. Peach cobbler for dessert. And I don't even really like peaches. \n\nParking is usually a pain, but there's a paid lot Nextdoor. If you're lucky, you'll score a free spot behind the building or in the few spots they have.",

We got the food to go because it was already to late plus we had the kids but the restaurant do have the opinion to sit inside or sit outside which i can't remember what the inside sitting looked like i just know it was not all that big but outside definitely had picnic tables with over head tents where you have a street view of the cars going by or pulling up which is not to bad depending on the weather i think the outside seating looked better plus i believe music was playing as well. \n\nOver all ratting of the restaurant 6/10 \nMac and cheese 4/10\nBake beans 6/10\nHot chicken mild wings 7/10 some reason the mild was very spicy \nBanana pudding 7/10\nCollard greens 6/10\nPeach cobbler 7/10\nWaffles 4/10\n\nSome how the Mac and cheese, bake beans , the slice of bread and the 3 wings was all spicy and i asked for a mild flavor.",

The line was confusing as there was not a lot of room to do a straight line back unless you lined up out the door into the outdoor seating area. We figured it out and made our order. I got the two piece small dark with two sides. \nKara was honest with me about the banana pudding after I told her what I have to have in a bp. I appreciate her honesty\nIt took 10 minutes to get our order to go and we were out. \nThey seemed to have plenty workers which is a plus in this economy. The people dining in seemed to be enjoying their meals. \nAs for my food, the chicken wasn't seasoned so that was unfortunate. I think this spot is best for those who like to have the spice to their chicken. I don't do spice so I got the plain chicken. The greens were plain as well with no seasoning or ham. The potato salad had a nice taste to it. \nI wouldn't go back but I think again this is great for those who like spicy chicken.",

While this isn't typically a place for table service, one of the employees took it upon himself to run drinks and grab trash.

I did want to wash my hands, but the bathroom was disgusting, so I walked out and used the hand wipes at the tables instead. The service was good. Everyone was very pleasant.",

Absolutely love their hot chicken.\n\nParking at Hattie's can be a little tricky (you enter at one side and then drive behind the building for parking behind or later in the front). But there's plenty of seating and service is pretty quick. I recommend the Hot Chicken Sandwich because seriously, this chicken is HOT, and the pickles, comeback sauce, and coleslaw on top help balance the heat (I normally am not a coleslaw person but theirs rocks!!). I also love their crinkle cut fries and suggest getting extra comeback sauce to go with them. My boyfriend got the quarter dark with collard greens and pimento cheese, which were all very good as well. \n\nOverall, Hattie B's Hot Chicken really does live up to the name, and definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!",

We were able to get chicken sandwiches as well as chicken tendered. We also got an order of the mac and cheese and an order of the cold slaw. For dessert they had banana pudding individually packaged and apple pie. \n\nIt was easy to set up and have a buffet style. The team was able to come up and either make a plate or grab one of the boxes with the chicken sandwiches. It was easy to feed the time in a time efficient manor. Also everyone loved it because they were able to choose how spicy they wanted their chicken. \n\nI loved the spicy one but it has a kick to it. I also loved all the dipping sauces that came with the chicken. My favorite combination was the ranch and the spicy chicken. I also loved the mac and cheese and I wish I would have had space for the banana pudding. I would order from them again.",

I ordered the tenders - mild with a side of fries and pimento Mac n cheese.  Glad we stopped in.  We sat outside in the patio and enjoyed the beautiful day with the overhead heaters to take away the chill.  The tenders had a nice crunch and the spice level was perfect and not over powering.

        "text": "This was on top of the most recommended place to check out on several of my friend's curated Atlanta must-see lists. I made it my priority to fit this into any itinerary I had. Location is a bit away from the other places I wanted to go to, but I can say it's definitely worth trek!\n\nEven going with high expectations, the hot chicken sandwiches here definitely lived up to the hype. I got the hot chicken with medium spicy level and a side of crinkle fries. The spice they put on the fries were also really good, a reminiscent to old bay seasoning. The hot chicken sandwich itself was very juicy and flavorful to every bite. I'm still thinking about it til this day!\n\nOverall; I highly recommend adding this to your to-do list in ATL if you're on the fence! Also do expect to wait on line depending on what time of day you come. We waited maybe 10-15 minutes at 1pm Saturday afternoon.",

I was able to come here to grab some lunch with co-workers and though this place is literally all the way downtown, it was worth the drive.\n\nBeware -- Hattie B's doesn't have the best parking so you may get confused or lost parking, but once you endure that part, everything afterwards will be great! \n\nI ordered the chicken sandwich with mild seasoning (I usually get the medium but I didn't want to get a too spicy lunch) and I got it with the fries. I also got some ranch sauce for my sandwich. Mild seasoning was perfect; it had exactly a really mild kick and it was the perfect flavoring! The chicken patty also had a bit of a sweet flavor which was very nice. \n\nThe chicken patty was really meaty and jam packed; it isn't your usual chicken sandwich. There's truly a lot of flavor and plenty of chicken to go around, which makes the sandwich really appetizing. It comes with a pickle, and for the cost (~$13), it's truly worth it! \n\nI want to try the medium again next time as the mild really didn't have much spice but this most recent experience made me redevelop my appreciation for Hattie B's. If you live in ATL, you need to check this place out!",

        "text": "Love Hattie B's! Having lived in Nashville for a few years, this was definitely our go to spot! \n\nThe customer service was amazing. Everyone was super friendly and the food came out super fast and hot. \n\nThe line wasn't long at all for lunch on a Thursday. We got the tenders (mild) and wings (hot) with pimento mac & cheese, greens, and fries on the side. \n\nDocking off a few stars for the banana pudding, mac & cheese, portion of the fries, and parking. \n\nThe banana pudding's consistency was off. It was very very mushy with an odd taste to it. Maybe we just had a bad batch? Kind of sad because we usually devour it, but this time we got halfway and just gave up. \n\nThe pimento mac and cheese was a bit on the dry side. Usually they have it pretty creamy with a hint of zest from the pimento, but this one was neither. \n\nThe portion of the fries was pretty little. We're used to having to take our fries home because it was so much. Lol. This time we finished our fries before we finished our chicken. \n\nPretty tight squeeze into the lot with super limited parking. There is a lot right next door, but you do have to pay for parking. \n\nOverall a 3. We would come back because we love Hattie B's. But it definitely isn't like the one in Nashville.",

        "text": "This Hattie B's Hot Chicken location can be found next door (in a separate parking lot) to a Sherwin- Williams Paint store. Parking is pretty limited and we were very lucky to get the last parking spot on a Tuesday evening a little before 7 pm.\n\nWe waited in a line to get inside (as there was a sign to allow only so many people to come inside, to social distance. After we looked over the menu, we ended up ordering:\n\nLarge Dark Plate, $12 prior to tax- This item comes with sides, in which my husband picked Bacon Cheddar Grits and Black Eyed Peas Salad. I didn't have any of my husband's chicken but he thought it was good. The grits was very good and probably one of the best grits I have ever had (probably because there was bacon and cheese in it). The salad was okay.\n\nFried Jumbo Tenders Plate, $11 prior to tax- My entrée comes with sides, in which I ended up picking Crinkle Cut French Fries and Southern Collared Greens. The fries were a major disappointment. They were soggy and cold. The collared greens were good. The jumbo tenders were pretty big but were also cold on the inside. Quite disappointed and had to reheat them in the microwave (since we ordered this to go. I hate to think I would have eaten cold chicken if I was dining in).\n\nLarge Apple Clobber, $4 prior to tax- My husband ordered this. This dessert wasn't bad but maybe a little too sweet for me. My husband thought the same.\n-----------------------\n(Total= $25.05 after tax)\n\nService was friendly when we made our order with the employee behind the register. I really liked this employee, she made me laugh when I was placing my order. I think in general, all the employees we interacted with were friendly.\n\nWhile we sat at a table waiting for our to go order, I was surprised to see people checking their to go orders. There were a few people that seemed to have missing items from their order (I think they may have made their order online or via phone). But luckily we weren't missing anything from our order.\n\nI was rather disappointed with this place and was expecting more, especially since it is so highly rated on Yelp (overall rating of 4.5 stars with over 1750 reviews at this time of this review). I wouldn't come back if I lived in this area.",

        "text": "Lots of hype entering this place and maybe it was a victim of unusually high expectations. I got a chicken sandwich with all the fixins (medium heat), pimento Mac, and peach cobbler. It was a solid sandwich and a tasty meal, but it wasn't anything memorable. Luckily I had no line when I entered and the service was very very friendly!\n\nSandwich was decent but I kept feeling like it was just missing something. Maybe I should've gotten Hot because I felt like it was missing some depth of flavor. There was a decently light crisp, but again, nothing spectacular. Sandwich looked good though. \n\nThe Mac was very disappointing and tasted pretty bland. I think it would be boosted so much if it had some jalapeños in it. \n\nThe peach cobbler was just decent as well. Although I will say when I put some of the cobbler jam on the sandwich, it really heightened my experience with the sweet salty contrast.\n\nOverall I'm glad I went but I would be OK not going again when I visit Atlanta.",

I ran back to my car since parking was scarce and where I parked there was a concern about possibly getting towed. My Fiancé and I grabbed a piece each, looked at each other, and then took a bite.

I got the flavor after hot, and it was certainly HOT. the chicken was a little fatty/had a little slime (like most places do). I cleaned around it and ate it. It was good, but a little salty. The fries were also salty--a little too salty for me. I enjoyed the plate overall and will likely be back (for my free dessert :))",

I was curious to see if it was as good as the first time and also if was as good in another state. Well it didn't disappoint! I ordered the half bird mild and it was delicious. For sides I had Mac n cheese and greens  and they were both good but the Mac n cheese wasn't as good as I remembered but not bad. My husband tried the cheesy grits; they were actually good for fast food place. We also tried the waffles which were delicious as well. Another person in our party had the potato salad and it was delicious as well. I think it's safe to say that pretty much everything on the menu is delicious. If you're in a town that has a Hattie B's then it would behoove you try it, you won't regret it! One last comment..,,the homemade lemonade is the best!!",
