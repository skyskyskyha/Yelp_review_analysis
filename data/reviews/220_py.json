I loved it way more than my custom pizza. \n\nI also got a pizza with plant based sausage and pepperoni. I couldn't tell the difference in flavor from regular meat. I had to verify it was plant based lol. VERY good. \n\nPizza is made to order within ~10mins from order to first bite. The staff is alright they give the level of service I'd expect in a fast casual spot. Because there's a wait time for the pizza, seating is usually taken by folks waiting on their pizza but frees up once they get it and head out. Not a lot stay and eat in.",

Now, mind you, I'm a huge hip-hop fan, but when it's so loud you're trying to think or eat inside the restaurant is a not-so-great experience. They have an area for pick up orders/delivery service. I went there & waited patiently. No one came. All the workers were on the other side, cooking/preparing. The inside wasn't busy. When I went to the register, I told one employee I needed to pick up my \"to go\" order. He asked me to step back over to where I had just come from. \nHe didn't seem too happy, but got my pizza from the warmer & I was on my way. \n\nThe pizza was pretty good. Maybe it was just an off day for them. I do want to try them again & try another pizza. I follow them on Instagram & everyone's pizzas look so good! So I'm willing to try them another time. \n\nPrices are reasonable. Parking on the street or in the deck.",

                "text": "Yo, this pizza is sooo good! One tip, don't build your own pizza. Try one of their specialties! They've really crafted some deliciousness. \n\nToday, Slim +Huskies was provided for a group for lunch. I'd had it before from a different location and wasn't very impressed, but today was a totally different story. So much so, that I ended up ordering pizza from here myself later in the day. \n\nThankfully, because of how small the slices are cut on the slims, I could taste test a few if the different options that were provided for lunch. Let me just tell you, I never thought I was a white sauce girl, but the PREAM and Smokin' Herb + Salmon are AMAZING!! Probably my new favorite pizza. The PREAM is basically supreme, but with white sauce (not too much, just enough so that your pizza isn't dry) instead of red. The other was a white sauce based pizza as well, with salmon, cheese, onion, and mushroom. The Ronny Roni Rone, a traditional pepperoni pizza, was delicious as well. The OG red sauce is perfect. The smokin' herb + chicken was ok. My least favorite, but still cool. When I went back later in the day I went with the PREAM slim and it gave everything it was supposed to give! \n\nThey have two new pizzas, Buffalo shrimp and Buffalo chicken. Right now the Buffalo chicken pizza is Pizza of the Month, which means you can get the husky (large) for just $10 all of June. \n\nService, based on takeout, was good. It was ready right when I got there and the young lady was friendly. The space was really clean. Garage is kinda sketch so I opted for street parking, especially since I knew I'd be in and out. Overall, I'm a fan! I had a much better experience at this location than I did at Old Nat.",

                "text": "TL;DR: I really wanted to like Slim & Husky's but it was really average.\n\nARRIVAL: I came here on a Saturday around 530 pm. It wasn't too busy inside the restaurants, with a handful of families with kids just finishing up dining in and an almost-steady flow of one party coming in for pick up orders at a time.\n\nAMBIANCE: Furniture looks like small chipotle. Light wooden benches/seating and stone accent pillars. Large wall artwork gives it a down to earth character.\n\nMENU: You order on one of the screens when you arrive and our payment attachment was broken, so we did the pay at register option. The menu has 10\" and 16\" pizzas and are craft flatbread-style. I love unexpected pizza combinations, but i really didn't love any of these. They also have a BYO option which will probably satisfy most. We ordered a  slim pepperoni with extra house blend cheese, 1 slim Nashville hot chicken with jalapeno cilantro ranch drizzle, 2 cinnamon rolls (1 OG, 1 Cookie Monsta), 2 fountain drinks.\n\nDRINKS: I LOVE that they have craft sodas here! Black cherry soda is usually my favorite, but this one had the addition of tarragon so i'm glad i tried it first and it just doesn't hit the same. I got the pineapple cream instead and yum! I've only seen these at once at a totally different restaurant in California and they're still great. We planned to order the blue frosty drink, but it's not listed in the ordering system and we had to pay at the register, so we asked about it and the man gave us a sample letting us know that people had been saying it was too sweet; my boyfriend tried it and it was indeed even too sweet for him (when usually he has no limits) so we skipped that.\n\nFOOD: This is the interesting part....I was extremely hungry this day as we ended up here because traffic was to bad getting where we wanted to go up north and yet, my nashville hot chicken pizza was honestly....tasteless. While the pizzas looked great, they genuinely had no taste. I have never experienced this nor did i have trouble tasting the soda for example or the cinnamon rolls, but the pizza wasn't at all spicy despite having jalapenos, banana peppers, with hot honey AND the jalapeno cilantro drizzle and genuinely flavorless including the chicken. The pepperoni didn't look like it had the extra cheese we ordered and got the same review of being tasteless. All three cinnamon rolls OG, Cookie Monsta, and Strawberry shortcake were extremely soft in an undercooked way (explanation why we ended up with 3 to follow) not in the desired pillowy-pastry way. The dough as you can see from the photos don't look like they had a good rise either, they just look flat and rolled out. The toppings and drizzles were completely melted and all over the box and each other. I'm perfectly happy eating desserts that leave a huge mess, but these weren't nearly worth it. I also love desserts and pastries, but i had one bite of the OG and cookie mosta and didn't want any more. I want to be clear that the pizzas were BAD but they also weren't good, it was genuinely just tasteless despite looking great.\n\nCLEANLINESS: Tables weren't clean when we arrived and took quite a while for someone to come out and clean tables, but I appreciate that they had someone come out at all as (hostess-seated restaurants aside) this isn't something I commonly see in ATL. He did also ask if i wanted to him to wipe down the table I was already sitting at which was very much appreciated as well even thought it wasn't visibly super dirty.\n\nSERVICE: The cashier was friendly and informative (see above). The man that came to clean the table was also friendly and made the effort to clean our table while we waited for pizza. There was a small mishap. We waited around 30 mins for our pizza and when they finally called us (they just call your name from the pick up area) and my boyfriend went to get them, he watched as guy dropped my pizza.... So he returned to our table empty handed and we proceeded to wait an extra 8 mins for then to make a replacement. They held my boyfriend's pepperoni during this time and it just sat there in the box getting cold and cheese congealing. They did offer an extra cinnamon roll for the wait which is how we ended up with 3 instead of 2, and they gave us an extra jalapeno cilantro drizzle (i already had one) and pineapple chipotle BBQ drizzle, which didn't seem nearly enough for the entire wait and mistake.\n\nEXPERIENCE: Overall with this experience, I was not happy and already thinking that I didn't want to return. It's just down the street from me and I was excited to have a craft pizza spot that's also POC-owned, but unfortunately I don't think i'll be returning.\n\nPRICE: On par with prices in ATL and the west midtown area. 2 pizzas, 2 cinnamon rolls, 2 drinks came out to be just under $50.\n\nOVERALL: I won't be returning here.",

We shared a husky, side salad, and cinnamon rolls (2-pack). Everything tasted delicious. The salad and pizza toppings were fresh and the cinnamon rolls were baked well (no raw dough, but not over baked/dried out either). Our pizza was a bit \"center loaded\" so the crust in the middle was not as crisp as the outside pieces so it made it a little more difficult and messy to eat, but the flavor was still good. Next time we will probably choose a recipe that has fewer toppings or build-our-own.",

There was hiphop and R&Bplaying. There are great murals in the walls dedicted to artist of those genres. \nYou order your food on one of 4 kiosks. They have a little bit of lag time so you have to be patient  because it's not going to pop like your phone. I got confused on how to end my order but the staff behind the counter building the pizzas are happy to give instructions. I ordered a build your own husky and a small salad. So a slim pizza is not thin crust, it's smaller than husky size. Most basic topping were free but cheese was $2 so it all balanced out.  There's a few beers and fountain sodas. Cups for water are .50c. Besides pizza, they have flavored cinnamon rolls. \nMy pizza was good! Because I ordered husky. I didn't have space for the salad and barely got through the pizza. This a a simple pizza place . Nothing fancy or authentic, but there is good staff, good food and a good vibe.",

                "text": "I'm going to turn into a pizza one day, I'm sure of it. But do you think that stops me from eating it at every turn? Absolutely not, because I am not a quitter. I'm devoted to my favorites and pizza, pizza is absolutely top 2 and it's not #2. \n\nMy favorite thing about it? The versatility. And versatile pizza is exactly what you'll get at Slim & Husky's. This trendy, Black-owned, Hip-Hop themed Pizzeria has Nashville roots and I'm so happy that they brought that soul and spirit to Atlanta! My boyfriend ordered Slim & Husky's one night only a few days after I had moved to Atlanta. He told me he was ordering pizza, he didn't tell me that it was going to be some legendary, bomb a** pizza though. Like, prepare ya girl! I was praying it wasn't some national chain brand with cheap cheese and flavorless sauce, (that I'd still scarf down but I deserve better! lol) and then, he opens this pizza box. \n\nSlim & Husky's serves up flatbread-style pizza with some amazing topping options and epic specialty flavors with R&B names like Rony, Roni, Rone pepperoni pizza, the vegetarian California Love and the Red Light Special margarita style, the options are there! Their tasty drizzle options such as the Cilantro Ranch and Garlic Butter are soooo good although, possibly not the healthiest options lol. I've tasted a few specialty pizzas and love building my own pizza as well, each pizza has always been a hit! Onto the cinnamon rolls - phew. (I always say that I'm not a sweets person in all of my reviews and I know that people are sick of me lolol but here we go) I'm not usually a sweet person, I have to crave them but when it comes time for Slim & Husky's, the craving for those cinnamon rolls is so real. With super decadent flavors such as the strawberry Too Short cakes, the blueberry lemon MS Berry or even the extremely rich Sticky Fingaz which is covered in caramel sauce, bacon, whiskey and glazed pecans - crazyyyyy good.\n\nI've only had Slim & Husky's via delivery and pickup, but during pickups, I always appreciate the awesome decor. With walls covered in Black art and Hip-Hop themed pieces, I love seeing these amazing local legends depicted on the walls, the energy is so real. \n\nSo the next time that you're looking for a slice of heaven or are looking to support a fantastic Black-owned biz, look no further!",

They've changed the ordering process which could be a little confusing but the pizza still taste great. I did notice this time around that the music was blaring over the system so when I tried to ask the young man about my pizza, I don't think he clearly understood the modification I needed to make.  However, even with that small mishap the pizza was still good!  Definitely worth trying and you have to get the special red sauce. It has a little spice. Let's talk about the parking. It can be a bit chaotic, but there is a parking garage attached that allows 15 minutes of free parking. The downside is they only have four spots and they could be taken at the time you choose to go which will lead you to street parking or looking for parking two blocks south so pack your patience if it's a busy weekend and you want to give them a try!",

Since it was loud it was hard to hear what the workers were saying. \n\nAs for the pizza, I made my own small pizza with regular sauce, chicken, spinach, extra cheese, pepperoni and onions.

However, after many months of not going, we were excited to indulge in their pizza on Friday night. The host was super friendly when we walked in. We both ordered the smokin herb with salmon and cinnamon rolls (Not pictured). Since they make it to order, we had a small wait, but nothing to crazy. The prices have gone up slightly, but that's everywhere these days. We were so hungry, we opted to eat in the car. It was sooo good, fresh and hot! We also had the pineapple chipotle bbq sauce!!! Be sure to get it! Overall, we thoroughly enjoy this location and we will be back again in the future!",

You can choose from 12- or 15-inch doughs (Slim or Husky)--in my opinion, the 12-inch is more than enough! The restaurant can hold large groups if necessary. They have a covered patio. \n\nThey have beer on tap but we opted for cocktails instead. We ordered margaritas, which were pre-mixed. It would have been nice to have fresh drinks. \n\nWe got ordered the garlic butter on the side and it was a huge miss. It was sweet...not sure if it was butter. Would've been nice if it was melted. The great thing is it didn't make or break the pizza! \n\nThe restaurant itself is very casual. We assumed it was more formal. It would be really cool if they had a full bar or good drinks. I like the vibe...I like the music and I can see how this could be a hot spot in ATL. I do think the dining room could be a bit cleaner. But overall, the pizza was tasty and I'd go back for a quick dinner.",

Ohhhh don't let me forget the Cinnamon Rolls  --'Ms. Berry' and 'The Ninja Turtle'\n\nBonus: Umm this is personal one, They have Gatorade on their drink machine!

Half the line was closed down, as such, I had to place my order on the side WITH NO MENU. Can you imagine how hard this is when it's your first time visiting? Geesh. \n\nIn case you haven't been, the draw to this establishment is that you go down the line and build your creation, ending at the cashier. Imagine the Subway flow to the max... Ok, back to the story! The cashier explained that they were short staffed which led to the partial line closure. Ok, I can understand that. The show must go on, but, goodness, can I get a paper menu or something?\n\nLet's proceed, they had a great playlist playing and I was enjoying the music selection. However, when I tell you the volume was on CLUB! I'm talking in your ear, feel the beat through your body, can't hear my thoughts type volume. I was absolutely perplexed by this and of course, January wanted to dine-in! \n\nLet's talk food! I decided on a salad, the greens were fresh, the chicken was well seasoned, moist, and grilled to perfection. The salad dressing came in a packet so you can imagine the flavor, but the salad itself was flavorly enjoyable. \n\nOverall, I don't know how to feel about this experience. However, if you want a good salad, get it to go! Ha.",

My son didn't like the cheese blend on his pizza and said his sauce was sweet, and my husband said his pizza was too soft in the middle and the taste was just not that great. He also got a beer. The establishment is a \"beeria\" but there were only 5 beers.  I'm not sure how many beers constitutes a \"beeria\". On to the garlic knots. They were  bread knots and soft however, the garlic was missing.  It was just plain bread basically.",

I order the salmon pizza, I don't know if was garlic butter sauce or some kind of oil on it but it was so greasy I didn't want to put the box on the seat in my car.  The salmon looked as if someone just threw it on there and it was way too salty (mind you I love salmon and I've had it multiple times so I know how it's supposed to taste).  I was disappointed with the lack of presentation and it wasn't good on top of that!  I MIGHT give them another try but not at that location, if so I'll review them too of course.\n\nThis was a major disappointment.",

I love that the pizzas are made in front of you and anything goes. The staff were friendly and helpful. \n\nAs with everything right now, low staffing means not everything is addressed right away. Like some genius spilled something by the tables and left it there, but the staff were busy making pizzas and it stayed there for quite some time. Overall I'll definitely be revisiting",

Yes we are experiencing low staffing which makes it harder to get to everything as quickly as we would like but we have a great management team there. I will share your feedback with them to bring this to their attention. We will make it a point to prevent this from taking so long to clean up in the future. We appreciate your feedback, glad you enjoyed yourself, and look forward to serving you again!",

Then from there you can choose their custom toppings or make your own. Fory visit, I went with the slim, five on it-basically thin crust cheese pizza. They used a variety of cheeses and when I you my pizza was cheesy, think of the cheese pizza from ninja turtle days lol. Even though it was packed with cheese, the pizza sauce was also full with flavor too! I think I have another favorite pizza place in my life now! Slim and Husky's was great and anyone visiting Atlanta has to give it a try. \n\nBianca",
