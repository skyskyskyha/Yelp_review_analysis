You order online and include your car make and model, you check in when you pull in, then when your food is ready they deliver it to your car.\n\nOf course my all time favorite kale/poblano/mushroom taco was amazing per usual!  Only issue is that I ordered chips and salsa and got home to realize they forgot the chips.  Luckily had some chips at home so was able to still enjoy the salsa they provided.  One downside of this contactless delivery is your inability to check the contents of your order before driving off but oh well!\n\nI hope everyone continues to support Little Rey during this time bc I will sink into a deep dark depression if I have to live life without their bfast tacos post Covid.",

You order before sitting down and they bring it to your table. I ordered the traditional chicken taco and it was GREAT. It had a lot of chicken and it was really flavorful. It cost about $4.50 for the taco. Also ordered a margarita but that was nothing special. The chips and salsa were $2 and were great! Definitely recommend trying the dipping sauces. My friend ordered the fries with jalapeños and bacon and they were AMAZING, even a little better than the taco. They came with a white dipping sauce that was really good as well. Overall, I'll definitely be returning to try a different taco or maybe the breakfast next time.",

I didn't care for how long I waited for someone to clean it off. When someone finally came, he wiped off the other couples' table and started to walk right past mine. I dismissed it and a young inexperienced worker. \n\nMy tacos were amazing. I got the cilantro lime rice (or something like that) with grilled chicken tacos and cheese dip. The chips and dip were amazing. My tacos were good and filling. I probably should have ordered one. The margarita was good as well. My\nBoyfriend loved the avocado cream or something like that. I'm terrible with food names lol but everything was good. I was surprised to see they served watermelon as a side. Never thought about that before.

The inside is well decorated and was bustling with young professional types. And that right there is the best I can say about the place.  We ordered chicken tacos and pork tacos along with a serving of queso. The chicken taco was just meh. The pork taco had a growing pool of grease each time I lifted the taco. It was also a take it or leave it dish. The queso was a large serving and had either chopped or shredded chicken in it. I was ok with that but it did not really add to the flavor. I really did not like the scoop of guacamole being included with the queso. Those two creamy textures together were off putting.  All in all we found the food flavorless and it was neither worth finishing nor taking home the leftovers.",

We ordered a  few tacos each and decided to split the breakfast avocado tostada. For a decent sized lunch of tacos,  it came to $50-which is  more than I'd ever like to pay for lunch or tacos for two. The chicken and pork al carbon were flavorful, the homemade flour tacos were perfect, and the salsa options were vast and all flavorsome. However, the Oaxaca was too watery and made the corn tortilla  completely fall apart, the steak al carbon and brisket tacos were dry, and the tostada was a let down for the price of almost two tacos. Overall I'd  say most of the flavors are  spot on, but I'd not wait in line outside again and pay $50 for it.",

        "text": "First off, I'll eat anything and everything Ford Fry touches. His latest casual taco and chicken venture is no exception. Also, I live across the street, so I've been in numerous times. My most recent visit was today for a quick meal before running some errands. There is usually a line, especially at peak meal times, so know that it most likely won't be a quick in and out thing, unless you ordered ahead (they have online ordering). The line moves quick  as there are 2 registers, and the menus are in a rack at the entrance so there's time to decide while you wait. I usually get tacos, but today opted for the arroz con pollo (rice with chicken). \n\nI placed my order and grabbed some sparking water w/ lemon (they have still and sparkling on tap!) and took a seat while I waited. They call your name over the loud speaker when your food is ready. 20 minutes later of browsing the 'gram and realizing that everyone both before and after me in line had gotten their food, I moseyed up to the pick up counter to inquire about my order. The lady at the counter looked perplexed and admitted she didn't know what happened to my order but that they'd have it out straight away as a simple arroz con pollo order shouldn't take anywhere near the time I waited. She then spoke to a lady in a denim shirt uniform (manager?) who came over and asked for my receipt so that they could give me a full refund. \n\nNow, I work as a retail pharmacist, so my patience level is probably leagues higher than most and I'm well aware that these things happen. I was not expecting anything out of it, really. However, I was super impressed by how the staff owned up to their mistake and made it right. And the food, of course, was delicious. Like a Chipotle bowl but way better with tons of super greens on top, avocado, pickled red onion. Do not skip out on the sauces and salsa bar they have, either. By far, my favorite thing to get here is the breakfast tacos. They are all sorts of messy but oh so delicious, and at $3-$4 each you can't really go wrong. Do yourself a favor and make it out of bed early for a couple.",

They have indoor and covered outdoor seating and lots of nice plants hanging around.

        "text": "I pass this place ALL the time traveling on Piedmont and never gave it much thought, with that being said the outside is a bit quirky. You can easily miss it. There is a large parking lot in what seems to the back of the lot. You enter from what I consider to be the back, and the entrance alone is an experience. I appreciate how they have menus waiting outside before you even get to the door. I also appreciate that the bathrooms are located outside (not completely outside, still connected to the main building) of the restaurant, seeing people open and close a bathroom door while I'm eating can be unappealing.\n\nYou order at the counter and they give you a table number. I had the popular chicken al carbon taco, traditional carne asada, the esquites (corn side dish), queso, and a rio red margarita. All this was a pretty penny (high $30something for lunch). I was genuinely disappointed. The chicken al carbon outside of the taco was good. The carne asada tacos were not good, they had a sweet taste and a tough texture. The cord side dish was uncooked fresh corn, a soupy mixture as a base, a nice sauce and cotija cheese on top. I love corn but I only ate two bites of this. The queso was the best part of my meal! They have queso fries with  jalapenos on top, I enjoyed the location itself so much that I plan to go back and at least try these and another margarita. The margarita wasn't strong, tasty but not strong.\n\nAgain, I truly enjoyed the service, the location, the aesthetics of the restaurant, but I wouldn't count on the food.",

        "text": "I don't know what you and your colleagues discuss during downtime, but my super fantastic coworker and I recently just went over all the Ford Fry restaurants we've been to. Not that we have a competition going on or anything, but I might have a slight edge now that I've paid the hot and new Little Rey a visit!\n\nLittle Rey is located at the intersection of Piedmont, Piedmont Circle, and Cheshire Bridge. Getting in and out of the lot is slightly hairy but not too terrible. So glad this restaurant has its own parking. The restrooms are outside, and I appreciate how they have visual cues to tell you if they're occupied or not. The little sinks were cute.\n\nUnlike most restaurants from Mr. Fry, you don't have to save this one for a special occasion. It's a fast-casual eatery with the prices to match. But like his other spots; Little Rey is beautifully set-up and decorated, and it has a breezy southwestern feel. Sunny and outgoing Jackson took my order and offered to answer any questions for me. I had to order off the breakfast menu since it was a weekday and not yet 11 AM. No matter, there were 5 breakfast tacos to choose from and other entrees like chalupas, avocado toast, hotcakes, and huevos rancheros. \n\nYou don't have to wait by the counter for your order which is great if you wanted to grab a table outside; you'll still be able to hear your name being called over the speakers. The view is just of a busy intersection, but it's still a pleasant patio that gets a lot of sunshine. \n\nAll of the breakfast tacos come with migas (a tortilla-based concoction according to searching the interwebs), refried beans, and cheese tucked into homemade flour tortillas. The taco sampler I created included:\n-Bacon ($3.25): There were heaps of thick bacon pieces in this taco. However, there was a puddle of oil at the bottom. Other than that, it was pretty good.\n-Steak ($4): This one was my favorite, with a generous amount of flavorful tender steak. \n-Mushroom, kale, and poblano ($3.25): For a dose of veggies, try this taco out.\nI utilized some medium hot sauce from the selections by the counter, but the tacos were totally fine on their own too. Just like at sister establishment Superica, the flour tortillas are the true superstars. They're freshly-made and have this delightful tender texture (but aren't flimsy). Top-notch. Oddly, there were still garnishes of cilantro on the meat tacos even though I stated no cilantro. Harrumph.\n\nOverall, I quite liked the tacos at Little Rey and would like to return and try the non-breakfast versions!\n\n[Review #900]",

        "text": "I was excited about this place opening up. I passed by it a few times and read about it prior. For fast food the prices are too high. I mean $6-7 for a taco and they don't even bring it to your table. That's BS. I love margaritas -- the margarita I ordered here was a real disgrace. It was carbonated. Since when are margaritas carbonated? It tasted like something out of a can-- maybe like a Limearita (I don't drink those). It was also overpriced for something that I'm sure had zero tequila in it. Can you tell I'm still mad lol? The small is $8 and the larger size is $16. The place is really cute inside and they have space to sit outside too. The parking lot can be a bit of a cluster. My tacos were great. I ordered the Chicken Al Carbon and Steak Al Carbon. The food was good but I probably won't be back anytime soon. I can go to a sit down restaurant and pay the same price. \n\nService A+\nFood A+\nPrice D-",

Beautiful space, chicken al carbon for two was delicious, esp. enjoyed the thick flour tortillas. \n\nSame as other reviews -- parking tricky, unclear if entering the wrong direction when turning left from heading north on Piedmont. It felt a little dicey. \n\nMy main comment (prompted me to make a yelp account to leave this) -- PLEASE, please offer stainless steel utensils and real glasses for folks dining in. Most people are. I was really alarmed by the enormous stacks of plastic, which all seemed to go into single stream garbage. I had hoped they were at least recycled or compostable, but foil and all was disposed of in one can when helpful staff whisked our trays away. I don't think I can feel good about coming back when each visit generates that much waste.",

        "text": "I've been to Little Rey twice: once for the grand opening and once for COVID-19 takeout. This review reflects both experiences.\n\nThe restaurant was PACKED for the grand opening (which I love to see). There was an issue with the cash registers, but the entire staff was very accommodating. This included free margaritas (A+) and free appetizers. I got the Pollo Al Carbon--which is a half bird served with tortillas, rice, and beans. This was a FANTASTIC value and great quality. The chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned and the beans were some of my favorite anywhere. Something that I've noticed here and really at all Ford Fry restaurants is that the vibe of the restaurant is stellar. When you first walk in, you can tell that this is authentic, quality food. This is reinforced by the small details, from the decor to the cup logos. \n\nBecause of the Grand Opening experience I had, Little Rey was one of the first businesses I could think of supporting when COVID-19 hit. I placed a to-go order online and pick-up was quick and easy. The staff was again super friendly. This time I got three tacos--Carne Asada, Puerco Al Carbon, and Suadero (all on Ford Fry's signature flour tortillas). These, again, were top notch quality and super tasty! I definitely recommend trying the Puerco Al Carbon--which had the best flavor out of all three in my opinion. However, this second experience made me realize that I think there is something missing from the resurant's flavor pallet. The more I thought about it the more I realize that the lack of cheese and sour cream was what I was lacking. While this is strictly personal preference and may not fit in well with Little Rey's style of Mexican, this is the only reason I'm giving 4 stars. \n\nThat being said, I still love this place and am planning on making another taco run (but adding cheese this time) and going for breakfast--and updating this review afterwards. Overall, I think Little Rey is another slam dunk for Ford Fry!",

I will say the tacos are loaded and filling.  I finished my potato and half my chorizo but they stuff it so well I made migas with the chorizo the next day and it was Fih.  The pancakes are what stood out for me.  The syrup is next level and they have great texture for cutting and absorbing syrup.  With Covid I take everything home and warm in the toaster oven....pancakes were fire",

        "text": "Loved this place. We were told that it was more like the San Diego style of tacos we like but it was more Tex-Mex to me. \n\nWe got there and waited in a short 20 minute line. They only had one person running the register which really made the the line crawl. We got chicken and brisket tacos with a margarita each. Those things were goooooodddd but really strong. \n\nWe also got chips and queso which was sitting in the cup for a little while, as there was a film of dried cheese on top. We saw other people get chips and queso or guac before their meal but ours came with the meal which I think added to the cooled queso. Tacos had a lot of flavor but the meat was a bit dry. \n\nI give 4 stars because everyone was really nice, we loved the atmosphere and the food was pretty good, but I do hope they get over their store opening struggles. We'll give em a try in a month or so.",

Nice crisp texture on the outside and juicy meat on the inside. Spice level was fairly high but nowhere near that of Hattie B's upper level hot chicken.

        "text": "Got a chance to stop by Little Rey and check it out during one of my many taco cravings. The restaurant is really well decorated, and I enjoy seeing all of the plant life in the space. I collected some fallen succulent leaves for propagating later haha.\n\nMy friend accompanied me to the restaurant, and she ordered the cheese taco and steak taco. I didn't get a chance to try either but she said the cheese taco was one of the best tacos she'd ever eaten. I ordered the half pollo al carbon, and I was very happy with my decision. The rice and beans are nothing to write home about the chicken was soooo good. Although I'm sure this chicken is slow-roasted on the grill for a long time, the flavors seemed like they were smoked into the chicken. It was succulent, and the meat was bursting with flavor. This is probably the only time the meat was better than the skin. The portions are huge, and I was able to get three meals out of the order (I'm a small person). On first taste, I was really meh about the tortillas. But, I brought them home and put them in my air fryer and crisped them a little. OH MY GOD. Game changer. I ate all three right then and there. You can taste how flavorful the tortillas are and they're like a snack in and of themselves. I almost went out and got more but stopped myself. \n\nPrices are steeper here, especially compared to Mama's down the street but the food is good. I hate that we have to pay for the chips and salsa here since they serve the same at Superica for free but I get it! When the sticker shock wears off, I'll probably be back!",

        "text": "Some days if you look up \"grumpy ole man\" in the dictionary you will find my pic. I go to Little Rey to get my favorite 1/2 chicken dish you know the one with  those amazing onion, peppers and that rice. Don't even get me started on that amazing grilled bird. \nI order and they are out! Then I order wings and they are out! Yep now I am grumpy! With a sour face I settle for tacos...yep they are fab too!\nI might have bitched a bit ok a lot. \nA few minutes after I sit down Toni shows up at my table with my complimentary order of that wonderful chicken...omg!\nI am all in for this place and it's amazing staff!\nOK i don't like the QSR format but I will make an exception for this food!\nGo eat and enjoy!",
