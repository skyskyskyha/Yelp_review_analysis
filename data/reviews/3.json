But finally the ox tail we have been waiting for is finally back on the day we stop by for my birthday dinner. \nThe ox-tail was the high light of the night. My favorite curry flavor out of all the dishes here. It was fall of the bone good. The curry is so good with everything rice or the leftover bread from the mussel dish. \nWe also had the staple duck dynasty which never disappoints. \nThe mussel is a new dish and we loved it. I can dip in that sauce all day if they bring me more bread. \nPad see ew was good but the pad thai is much better. \nThe seafood curry is also a very good staple choice as you cannot go wrong with it. \nI have to setup a notification with the staff to get a notification sent to my phone whenever they make the oxtail special so I can come back for more.",

        "text": "I've been to Poor Calvin's a total of 4 times and everytime I go, I think I should go more often. To me, the restaurant represents what is unique about the Atlanta food scene which is fusion concepts. My wife and I were taking out a friend this time to celebrate. It's a higher end dining experience but well worth the money. As a small warning because it is popular, it can get crowded and as a result the ambiance can be a bit loud to those expecting a quieter dining experience.\n\nOnto the food. We got three appetitzers - the fried frog leg, the deviled egg with crab, and the lobster crawfish wanton. They were all fantastic and I highly recommend them. If I were to rank them, I'd say I'd pick the fried frog leg, the devil egg with crab and then the lobster crawfish wanton but that's because I was in a savory mood.\n\nI ended up getting the Duck Dynasty. The scallops were ridiculously good and the duck was tender eith the skin nicely crisp. My wife got the off menu special which was a trout stuffed with crab.\n\nAs always, a top level experience. Everyone who loves food and fusion needs to go.",

        "text": "Let me start this review by saying I've eaten at a lot of restaurants in Atlanta over the years, A LOT,  & Poor Calvin's is hands down the best of the best! I can not stress enough how fantastic our first experience was at Poor Calvin's. From being greeted as soon as we walked into the 'thank yous' walking out the door after dinner, top tier experience. \n\nOur server, Ashley. Let's start with her. There are not enough stars to represent the service we received from Ashley. She was knowledgeable of the menu, offered great recommendations, & provided overall exceptional service. Ashley is the kind of server others should aspire to be. \n\nI ordered the lychee martini (DELICIOUS! So refreshing, sweet, & strong! I would have ordered more than 2 if I weren't driving), the Lemongrass Steamed Mussels (OUTSTANDING!!), & the Australian Lamb Chops (AMAZING & seasoned to perfection!). \n\nMy dad ordered the Lobster Crawfish Wonton (he said they were very good) & the Oxtail Curry dish that was the special of the day. OMG! It was so delicious. I wish I'd ordered it for my entrée (I sampled some of his). I should have ordered an entrée of the Oxtail Curry to go. \n\nMy aunt ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese & enjoyed it. She said it was the perfect balance of lobster & macaroni & cheese. My uncle ordered the Deviled Eggs with Crab (Bougie Deviled Eggs, as he called them) and the Lobster Fried Rice. He raved about both of his dishes. \n\nEvery flavor paired magically together for everything we ate. We are planning to return next month & are hoping the oxtails are on the menu. If so, I can place my order now. \n\n\nThings to know:\n1. As everyone else has said, parking is limited. Go early if possible!\n2. Parties of 5 or more are put on one ticket. We learned that on our way to the restaurant. No issue but something to be mindful of if you have a large party.",

        "text": "Poor Calvin's is a Midtown institution, serving excellent Asian fusion cuisine. \n\nLocation and Parking \nLocated on Piedmont Rd, parking is free along the street in front of the restaurant. \n\nVenue and Atmosphere \nThe interior is decorated with luxurious velvet furniture, mood lighting, and gold statues.  There are fresh flowers on every table and plenty of windows for natural light. \n\nService \nService was prompt, courteous, and efficient. Our server game us plenty of suggestions and tasting notes as well. \n\nFood and Beverages \nEverything, from the cocktails to the entrees, was perfectly seasoned and presented beautifully. The Rum punch has several types of liquor but is well balanced with sweetness. The Bok-choy was  tender and sautéed well. The seafood curry was absolutely delicious, as was the fried chicken. The hint of coconut milk in the collard greens was unexpected, but tasty. Also, the lobster Mac and cheese gets 5-stars alone. \n\nVerdict \nThis is my third time dining here, and I'll definitely return!",

        "text": "This place was one of the highlights of my Atlanta trip. Everything was a 10/10 from the service, food, and ambience of the restaurant. It looks small from the outside but it is so cute and nice inside and was busy so definitely make reservations. \n\nThe menu, portions, and quality of the food was fantastic. \nFor appetizers we got the lobster and crawfish wontons and lychee martinis. Both were so good. The wontons were a GREAT appetizer and so yummy.\n\nFor dinner we got the grilled australian lamb chops and lobster fried rice. Both these dishes had a beautiful presentation and were so flavorful we literally ate every single bite with no leftovers. My friend is a picky eater and doesn't even eat lamb chops usually and LOVED both plates. Everything was cooked to perfection.\n\nDessert was sooo hard to choose from. Our server came to our corner of the restaurant and described each dessert dish to everyone so well that we were discussing what to get with other tables. We went with the toasted pound cake and was literally obsessed. I'm not even a banana fan and it was still amazing to me. The other tables around us who got every other dessert said everything else amazing too so clearly you can't go wrong. This whole dining experience was great.",

        "text": "A restaurant has to be pretty amazing for me to give it five stars. My husband and I dined here on Saturday evening for date night. Andre was our waiter and he was excellent!\n\nWe ordered the lemongrass mussels for our appetizer and my husband wanted to take the broth home it was that delicious!\n\nFor our main course: he ordered the fried grouper and I ordered the lamp chops. Both dishes were extremely flavorful and mouthwatering. The lamp chops were amazing!!!\n\nI would get those again! My husband enjoyed the grouper as well.\n\nThe presentation of the food is magazine worthy and the portion sizes of the dishes were great as well!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the toasted pound cake. It was interesting but not in a bad way.\n\nHands down I would go here again for the food!\n\nAs for the restaurant: The restaurant is fairly small, not a lot of seating so if you're looking for an intimate,  romantic space this could be it if you don't mind hearing the conversation of others or vice versus. I would not recommend Poor Calvin's for a private date night with your significant other, not too much privacy. Other than that you won't be disappointed with the food!\n\n 5 stars for the food!",

        "text": "I always have a fantastic time when I dine here, so it's always a treat when I get to go!\n\nI had reservations on NYE and was promptly greeted and sat. The location isn't large and is dimly lit so that makes it feel like a more intimate setting. Great for a date night or dinner w: a small group -- though the food is great, it wouldn't be my top pick for a large group. Throughout our dining experience, our waitress Ashley was personable and made great recommendations. They make sure to accommodate any allergies or dietary restrictions your party may have as well as run down any specials on their appetizers or entrees. (Pro tip: someone should always order the special, they hardly repeat so they're prettyyyy exclusive!) \n\nLast time, I got the crispy beef which is absolutely tasty and like a yummy stir fry. I've also tried their lobster Mac & cheese which is equally delish and not absent of the lobster they promise. This time I got the pad Thai which I really liked. It was vegetable heavy, the lobster and shrimp were both very fresh, and it was just an overall party in my mouth! Also, the portions are always large enough for at least 2 meals :-) \n\nThe price range is pretty moderate, but for the quality and experience it is very much worth it. \n\nI hope to come back in the future for their brunch and seafood curry my friend raves about.",

Poor Calvin's still has the best service, food and charming atmosphere for a special occasion, date night or to sample the menu.\n\nOur server Anthony was gracious, informative and friendly. He was very attentive and could rattle off the ingredients of the offerings without a hiccup. We went with the Wild Rum Punch cocktail to start, then Seafood Spring Rolls and the Crab Deviled Eggs.\nFor dinner was the coconut soup and Lobster Fried Rice (signature dish). Then for dessert was the Apple Cobbler empanadas topped with vanilla ice cream. Everything was superb. \nIt's been a few years since I'd dined here. The menu never disappoints. \n\nThings to note - reservations are suggested. This place stays busy and the footprint is fairly small. The bar holds about six chairs. There's an outdoor patio in front and the back is enclosed. Also 19% gratuity is included on every ticket. Parking is a small lot beside the restaurant otherwise check the signs so you're not booted or towed. \n\nI want to thank my Yelp Elite Atlanta crew for this gift (won raffle) to enjoy a delicious lunch to wrap up 2023! I won't stay away as long again!",

Portions are generous, definitely should do family style so you can try it all. My favorite app has to be the lobster crawfish wontons-- it was surprisingly flavorful, and the runner up is the lemongrass steamed mussels. They don't skimp out on the mussels, and you've got to dip the bread in the sauce. I've also tried the shaky shrimp and buttermilk fried frog legs which were also good. \nI've also loved every entree I've tried here-- the lobster fried rice, grass fed australian lamb chops, and the duck dynasty. \nCocktails are also all a hit. I recommend the NIrvana Nectar, Lychee Martini, and Pho :) \n\nService was also amazing!! I LOVED my server Ngoc. He was so pleasant and knowledgeable about everything on the menus. \n\nThere is a small lot for parking, and some street parking available. \n\nTLDR; make the reservation now :)",

Our waiter, TJ, promptly attended to our table.\nAfter placing our drink orders... he inquired about our visit and gave us the history of the restaurant and Chef Calvin.

There's a bar vibe which will take walk ins & then there is dinning areas which are 9-10 reservation only because they're always so booked & busy, however i have gotten lucky at times! There were times we also did not get so lucky! 10/10 recommend! I also tried this cute, ginger like honey drink (forgot the name) pretty good! It did give me a vibe of cold tea when you're sick just with liquor, which i do not mind! It was unique but great.",

        "text": "Tl;Dr: Large and hearty portions and flavors. Fun asian/southern fusion with excellent service and atmosphere. Try it once for the novelty \n\nA very nicely decorated restaurant with excellent service. All the dishes we got had huge portions so I would say 1 entree per person would fill you up. It's a very enjoyable experience with delicious dishes but personally, I wouldn't say that any of them were as composed or elevated as I would have hoped. Still very satisfying and comforting! \n\nLobster fried rice: Get!\nThe portion was a lot larger than I expected and it was very filling. The dish itself was very hearty and savory with lots and lots of lobster flavors so that was appreciated. I do wish it was cut with some more acidity to add more to the complexity but it was still very flavorful. \n\nShrimp grits: Maybe get? \nIt seems to be their vibe that they love their hearty dishes and of course these cheesy grits is no exception. it's delicious and comforting but I wouldn't say it's enough to warrant more than $30 for this. The sausage added a nice funky bite to the taste and the shrimp was perfectly cooked though. \n\nLobster mac and cheese: Sure! \nA fun loaded mac and cheese that's--you guessed it--very hearty and comforting. Gotta throw lobster on it too because why else are you at this restaurant? It's nothing too remarkable but if you want a seafood based mac n cheese to indulge those guilty pleasures then go for it. \n\nService: Excellent\nWaters refilled constantly (maybe a little too much lol). Servers were very eloquent with the menu items and recommendations. I appreciate it a lot \n\nFood: 7/10 \nAtmosphere: 9/10 \nService: 9/10 \nValue: 6/10",

I came for a small birthday dinner with a party of 5.  \n\nWe had reservations for 5pm right when they open and before opening there was already a line forming. We were seated when all of our party arrived. \n\nOur sever Anthony was wonderful from beginning to end. Very attentive, patient, and polite. Food came out at a perfect pace. The table was consistently cleared of dirty dishes and drinks were always filled. Anthony was amazing!\n\nThe food was amazing. For appetizers we had the Frog Legs, Seafood Spring Rolls, Lobster Mac and Fried Calamari which were all delicious and great portions. For entrees we had the Seafood Curry, Fried Grouper, Fried Chicken. All were excellent and satisfying portions.\n\nOverall I was very happy with my experience here. I'd recommend coming solo dolo, on a date, or with a small group of friends. The restaurant is pretty small and seating is tight and they don't take reservations over 6 ppl. Wonderful food excellent service will definitely be back!",

I finally was able to try it again and it was just as good! \nI would recommend making a reservation for as soon as they open and getting there about 15 minutes early so that you can park in their small parking lot. The seating can be tight but the decor is beautiful!!!\nThe \"special\" or \"seasonal\" dumplings they had for a starter were amazing! I couldn't choose between all the appetizers they have but went with these and was really pleased.\nI also had a honey, ginger cocktail which was sooo good.\nFor my entree I ordered the lamb chops with everything on it. It's really impressive how all of the food was so appetizing, and the quality of the food is top notch. I even tried some of my husband's fried chicken with Mac and cheese and it was delicious too! \nOur server was very knowledgeable and attentive.\nA must try in Atlanta.",

        "text": "As I continued my walk home, since I was 40 minutes out of midtown, I decided to walk here and arrived just a little after they opened.  I didn't have a reservation, and asked to sit at the bar.  I felt I was a little too casual but they were welcoming and friendly and I got the best seat in the house.  I could see all the drinks being made and ask what they were.\n\nTaylor? the bartender told me that they changed the cocktail menu and I told him to choose one of the new ones for me.  He brought the Mt. Fuji, soooo good!\n\nMe: Is it because I'm Asian? \nHe: O-o*\nMe: I'm just kidding!\n\nHe then told me about the croquettes special and the grilled duck in curry entree with a lobster tail...I ordered both!  Why not?  The croquettes were tasty and I loved the slaw that came with them.  The duck was perfect!  The curry was delicious!!!  I didn't know I had to work for my food, but that lobster tail was soooo good with the sauce!  I loved the rice that came with, because again that curry was soooo good!  Taylor also picked out a wine for me, and wouldn't you know, it was a Malbec...my go to and favorite.\n\nAfter I was done, he told me and the guy sitting next to me, about the dessert special, chocolate cake with ube filling.  Why not right?  Imagine our surprise when this ginormous wedge was brought out!  I couldn't finish it all so I took the rest home and had it for breakfast the next morning.  I mean, why not, right?\n\nMy friend I was visiting told me to say hi to Griffin, and he is one of the hosts.  We had a great conversation, and Yo and I came back the next evening.  Melek? was our bartender and he made us some wicked fun cocktails! What a fun place to come to!  I'm glad I stopped in!  I now have somewhere fun and familiar when I come back!",

Thanks God I did, because the lobster fried rice dish was maybe the best dish I have had in 2024 so far.  The service and ambiance were impeccable and the menu has something for everyone.  I also had the frog legs which were also amazing.",

Our service staff took the time to engage with her multiple times throughout our dinner. The food is still wonderful. Notable items on our recent visit were the Pho cocktail (lovingly called the Phoctail - nobody calls it that) and the candy apple dessert thing. The candy apple came recommended by our server. I wouldn't normally have gravitated to its description, but we were SO glad to have obliged. Ours was dressed with a delicious pandan drizzle that kept us going in and forget about just how huge the dessert was when it was served. All of a sudden, we weren't so stuffed from the entrees and apps! PC always delivers.",

Throughout the dinner our waters were filled, our questions were answered, and she consistently made sure our experience was going well. They even gave us a complimentary scoop of home made ice cream at the end and it was delicious! The food was delicious - both of our entrees were great but I'll say the appetizers really stood out. They're unique and delicious - I would never have thought to put a berry compote on what's essentially a lobster rangoon but it was fantastic. Great vibes as well - the lighting was low but it wasn't too dark, and the decorating was eclectic without being too much. Highly recommend!",

I've been looking forward to this for 3 weeks. We live 340 miles from ATL and we plan our trips around having a meal at Poor Calvin's. \n\nJustin was our server who had excellent help from our SA and I'm sorry I missed her name.

This is one of the best restaurants my friends and I have ever visited. We really enjoyed the innovative ways that the chef combined influences of Asian and Southern cuisine to create dishes that are truly unparalleled in their excellence. He is truly a mad food genius. Recommended dishes from here are Lobster Fried Rice, Lobster Wontons, Seafood Spring Rolls, and Seafood Curry. Everything was delicious. Parking is limited but there's a lot around the corner as well. Our server was so knowledgeable and described everything we ordered. I will be back again.\n\nPoor Calvin's offer's limited dine-in seating by reservation only. Established in November 2012, Poor Calvin's is a unique oasis in Downtown Atlanta that offers a rare cuisine of Thai fusion with Southern influences. Chef Calvin Phan has brought his perspective of international culinary fusion to the front line of Poor Calvin's. Chef Calvin Phan was exposed to the restaurant business at an early age, having come from a family who owned several restaurants, of all calibers, in Europe. Through this solid foundation, he immediately fell in love with culinary arts and decided to fulfill his life-long dream of working with food by attending culinary school in Germany.",

        "text": "I returned for another special occasion, and unfortunately was let down. The food tasted great as expected, but the experience was not positive - this did not feel like a $200+ dinner. We had a wonderful first experience at Poor Calvin's, but I don't think we'll be returning to dine in-house after this most recent experience. \n\n*AMBIANCE*  Even though we made reservations well in advance, we were sat at the front of house right next to the door where people walk in. The front of house is a completely different ambiance than the intimate back of house. We asked if we could move, but we're told no other tables were available. \nThe door was kept open, so flies were constantly coming in and landing on our food - and they weren't small flies either. We were continuously swatting over our food and unable to relax and have a nice conversation and enjoy our time. The hostess even walked by and commented on how the flies are always \"eating good\" here. \n\n*SERVICE* We struggled to get our server's attention throughout the meal. Additionally, our  appetizer did not come out until after the entire meal. This was covered by the restaurant, but definitely added to our disappointment for the evening. \n\n*TLDR FOR CUSTOMERS*  Food is great. To play it safe, I recommend getting Poor Calvin's as upscale takeout and not dining in house. \n\n*RECOMMENDATION FOR BUSINESS*  I recommend getting rid of the table right next to the door, and also installing a fan to make sure flies aren't landing on your customers' nice meals. The food is wonderful, but the ambiance completely ruined our celebratory evening. Additionally, at other establishments the seats right by the door are for walk-ins - if you make a reservation, you can ensure that you get an intimate table setting.",

I've been to Poor Calvin's quite a few times over the years, ranging from special occasions (birthdays, anniversaries) to random dinner dates, but every time I've went I've got top notch service with the most pleasant and attentive staff. Poor Calvin's is not a restaurant with tons of space, but it makes up for it with the ambiance and it's just more of an intimate experience. They always have an amazing special there, so always ask about the specials and I suggest you try it at least one time. This last time I visited Poor Calvin's was with a friend for dinner and I had the Seafood Curry and it did not disappoint!!! They have a lot of good things on their menu but this is one of my favorites!",

If this gratuity policy is true, we didn't understand how a waiter is not considered \"front of the house.\" We paid the extra gratuity on top of the 20% so as not to stiff our waiter, but it was a sour ending to an otherwise great meal.",

        "text": "Whenever I'm in Atlanta for business travel, dinner at Poor Calvin's is a must. The fusion of flavors from the Southeast - both Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Thailand) and the Southeastern U.S. - plus excellent service, is a winner.\n\nAn early dinner this week, during an evening thunderstorm, found Calvin's already buzzing at 6p. Warmly welcomed by the host (friendly in a way that I don't often see in NYC), I opted to sit at the bar as my introvert self had already had a long day of meetings. The bartender was excellent, friendly and chill in tone, but exceptionally well informed about the menu and adept at multi-tasking while making a strong drink. I chose the PHO, a unique blend of Bluecoat gin, spices, and toasted ginger and was very happy with the choice.\n\nI hadn't eaten all day - it was one of those days - so I wanted to sample dishes. I started with the watermelon salad, an off the menu special, and it was terrific: juicy watermelon slices topped with a lightly acidic dressing (to cut the sweetness) and with crabmeat. For the other appetizer that I sampled, I debated between the garlic tofu with pineapple dipping sauce or the deviled eggs and crab, served with lavender wine jelly, ghost pepper bbq, and caviar. I opted for the latter, the deviled eggs, but found it messy in appearance and taste. The deviled eggs were lightly fried, which tasted a bit odd. This was a rare miss from Poor Calvin's, so next time I'll do the tofu app.\n\nFor my entree, I should have remembered that I was in the South, where big prices ($40 a plate) also equal big portions, again quite unlike my normal NYC spots. I ordered the curry seafood, a massive bowl of lobster, shrimp, scallops, calamari, green mussels, and veggies served with rice and with a sweet coconut milk curry. The dish was very tasty, but too big so I left a lot uneaten.\n\nAll in all, Poor Calvin's is like a great, long-time friend: you can go for a while without visits but when you meet up you quickly get comfortable and have a fantastic and memorable time. Highly recommend.",

My friends and I walked over from a Yelp event since we were starving and it was close by. I was excited because I hadn't been here in a few years. The restaurant is intimate and has patio seating as well. The decor is beautiful. The menu features delicious cocktails as well as creative Asian fusion dishes. \n\nI ordered the Midnight Overture for my cocktail and is was delicious. It's rum based and has blackberries and yuzu. For my appetizer I had the lobster and crawfish wontons. They're as good as the last time I've had them. For my entree, I went with the lamb chops with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I added goat cheese as well. I've previously had this dish before and it's still amazing. My friends had the curry seafood and I'm definitely ordering it next time. Lastly we finished up with the peach cobbler empanadas and OMG. This is one of the best desserts I've had! I don't eat sweets too often, but can't wait to return and have it.\n\nThe staff was amazing and I was so pleased that the food and drinks are still as good as the last time I've had them years ago. I will not be waiting that long to return again.",

Overall, I could get the same kind of food for cheaper at a regular Chinese restaurant. Probably get more lobster meat too.",

The food is a mixture of Asian/Southern fusion and they did everything right, from the Seafood Curry to the ribs and pan seared sea bass, everyone enjoyed the food.

The lychee martini hit the spot. It was a nice variation with the touch of grapefruit. I didn't really taste the lobster in the wontons but they had a good crisp without being greasy. The presentation of the grouper was beautiful and it matched the taste. It was fresh and had a pleasant mix of flavors - sweet and savory. I recommend making a reservation to get a seat indoors. The bugs were out and wouldn't leave us and our food alone which was annoying. But overall the food was good quality and I loved that they even packed the pineapple in my leftovers. I wasn't blown away but I wish I came with a larger group for a family style meal so I could try more dishes!",

Only 6 people ordered because the 7th had a food allergy... \n\nWe had a reservation which I highly suggest because the restaurant is small. We were promptly greeted by our waitress who was Johnny on the spot the entire night! The tip is automatically included in the bill and she sure did work for it. \n\nWe ordered drinks, appetizers, & a few meals to share! The portions are plentiful so you can definitely share a meal with someone. \n\nIf you don't like something, too bad! They will not take anything back  or exchange it if you don't like it. It clearly states this at the bottom of the menu so we knew to not even ask. \n\nGot a food allergy? Too bad. They will make zero accommodations for you. Our waitress made sure to tell us that everything is cooked in the same wok and that's that! That's also clearly stated at the bottom on the menu. \n\nI opted for the lobster fried rice that was priced at over $40. Was it good?? Yes. Worth over $40? Absolutely not. \n\n\nI also ordered lobster Mac and cheese to go and it was so spicy, I could barely eat it. I guess I missed the part of the menu that mentions spice cause I was not prepared! \n\nThe potstickers appetizer: 3 stars \nThe dessert: 3 stars \nSangria: 5 stars\nAmbiance: 4 stars \n\nThe waitress told us that Calvin was in the back and we asked if he could come out. She said it was too busy to say hello to his customers which was a little disappointing.\n\nOur night at Poor Calvin's cost us almost $1k. Was it worth it?! No. But go see for yourself I guess!\n\nWe were lucky to find street parking but I'm sure it's impossible to find on the weekends.",

Our table enjoyed southern comfort foods like lobster mac and cheese and greens to fabulous seafood. \n\nIndoor and outdoor seating allows this venue to expand the kind of experience you want from intimate to casual.

Presented food in timely manner and always came by to check on me and wife on anything. The Bartenders were great and very sociable. They kept us laughing and having a good time. We will definitely come back from our 2 hour drive to spend at Poor Calvin's. Love it!",

We walked in and they asked if we had a reservation and we didn't but they were able to fit us in. We had a party of 5 and were so thankful they were able to accommodate us so late. The ambiance was very laid back and gave date night vibes which I loved even though we were there with family it wasn't too much. The waitress Joy was awesome she game so many great recommendations and was spot on for each. I ordered the lobster fried rice and a glass of Cabernet and everything was so good. All the vegetables and colors that were packed into this one dish was phenomenal. I would highly recommended this dish and this restaurant if you're in Atlanta or visiting.",
