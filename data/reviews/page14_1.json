        "text": "I've been to Divan several times, but this is my first time at this location since their move. They have some of the best Lamb Chops in the city. Although the new location is impressive, there were several things that impacted my experience.\n\n- Service:  5/10 We arrived for our reservation about 5 minutes early. I didn't necessarily care for where they seated us (right in the aisle way from the kitchen) and requested we be moved elsewhere, which they willingly did and we appreciated. However, it then took our server anywhere from 10-15mins to acknowledge us. There's also a 2hr limit per reservation and dress code doesn't seem to be strictly enforced. Our sever was friendly though and apparently hadn't been notified that we were now in his section. He also wasn't very attentive throughout the course of our dinner.\n\nOur seat was in a better spot but located near a door directly connected to the kitchen area (open concept) where the food was being plated. Before our food even came out, we noticed a fly pestering another table that eventually came over to our table when our food did come out, and a gnat that tried to climb into one of our wine glasses. I was also a bit turned off at seeing some of the staff walk into this same door directly from the walkway near valet with McDonald's drinks left right near the plates and the same area where the guests' food was being plated and put onto trays to be served. They stayed there for the remaining 1hr 30 we were seated, with one being placed directly on the shelf near some unused plates. I also didn't think it was very professional or sanitary to see staff use their bare hands to add garnishing onto peoples plates. It's super easy to subconsciously touch something that's been contaminated, so I'm surprised gloves aren't required here especially when the kitchen is in eyeshot of several guest tables.\n\n- Food: 10/10  I always get the lamb chops here and as usual, they didn't disappoint. My boyfriend didn't care for the Crab Risotto Croquettes. I enjoyed them, but we were both surprised at the size/portion.\n\nThe new location is great as well as the food, but the level of service is not on par with that I've experienced in the past with this restaurant (This seems to be an ongoing trend with restaurants in Atlanta these days). All in all, a great Friday dinner destination spot depending on when you go.",

We first tried the restaurants at Colony Square they were all booked, so we decided to try the castle on the hill, Divan's. You've passed by it numerous times and never went in, so I decided to do it for you. (LOL) Divan's is multilevel, 4 floors, which encompasses a private dining room, a hookah lounge, a bar, so many cozy and quaint rooms. Divan's is casual with a touch of chic, the food creatively yummy.  My guest had slow cooked lamb shank with saffron, fava beans and dill balsamic rice.  I had blackened verlasso salmon with oyster mushrooms, linguine alfredo., oh I also had cardamon tea, so good!\n\nWe passed on dessert, it was time to head on over to the Alliance Theatre.  I'm excited to revisit so I can try their desserts and explore more floors, I hope to see you there.",

        "text": "The cool historical structure sets an inviting tone. Service was top notch. The crab rice ball appetizer was delicious. It was a fair portion for one but too scant for two. But things were different for the entrees. Four of some of the largest scallops I've ever seen, most restaurants would serve three of these and get away with it -- so that was a bonus. They were perfectly cooked, and although I did want a little more flavor from the sauce (which maybe was just a little too subtle for my tastes), I'd still giving the dish five stars because four would be too low. The cauliflower side dish was perfectly seasoned and cooked, so believe your waitperson if they recommend it. The roasted potatoes I got as a side were two steps above most roasted tater sides, topped with bits of extra tasty diced aromatics. My wife's steamed PEI mussels were delicious and expertly prepared. All thumbs up.",

        "text": "I threw myself a birthday party at Divan about a week ago. I had never been but a good friend highly recommended it. I was looking for a sophisticated spot with good drinks, hookah lounge, and good food. Divan had all of these, and I was more than satisfied with my experience. Here's an all-inclusive snapshot of my night there(if you've got a minute):\n\nPulled up to the spot and they've got $10 valet service. The valets were on point but they had me go across the street to pick up my car (not cool).\nThe doorman is definitely good at his job, and always had the door ready coming and going.\nThe hostesses were a bit snobby. Definitely beautiful to look at, though.\nThe place may have been a house and might even be historical. There were 4 floors. Bottom two had open bars and dining. Third floor was the hookah floor with private rooms (where I was at) and open dining. The top floor I didn't know much about but super high status up there (so I assumed). A few of us chilled at the second floor bar before the party and the ambiance and vibe was just right. Lights were a bit dim, the crowd is enjoying themselves, and it had a very positive feel. I loved it.\nMy attendant to the room (G) was on point. He provided excellent service, understood how to take care of my guests, and was agreeable to my requests without hesitation. I won't go into the details but he and his staff went above and beyond that night.\nThe room was definitely relaxed and intimate. We had control of the thermostat, lighting, and could keep the door closed. Hookahs we're burning all night, the Mediterranean cuisine was probably up there with the best in the city (the lamb was incredible!), and the cocktails were outstanding. By the end of the night everyone was really enjoying themselves and no one wanted to leave.\nFinally, I want to thank misdee, the event coordinator. I contacted her through the Divan website and she responded within the hour. She was available and responsive anytime I called or emailed her. I was in contact with her on and off up until the event and she was very cool, helpful, knowledgeable, and willing to work with me during the entire process. There was never any confusion between us about the contract, what was included, any adjustments, or the bill. She certainly has the skills to plan an event and she means business. I wouldn't waste her time or Divans unless you're serious.\nAll in all, expect a great experience all around because that's what my guests and I had and what you deserve. Definitely going back! 5",

The grand marnier was the kicker.  Service was okay.  So convenient to the Arts center so I will definitely go again before a performance.",

I've been dining out frequently these days and to be honest they've all be letting me down sadly... but Divan really showed up.\n\nMy friend and I shared Turkey meat balls, The Duck leg Confit and the Lamb Shank. \n\nThe Turkey meat balls was fantastic. It was perfectly creamy with some texture and also the tomatoes and onions on top were great. They also give you unlimited bread to go with it. Delicious.\n\nThe Lamb Shank truly wowed me. I love Lamb but have eaten way too many overcooked Lamb at restaurants before. This was not the case with the Lamb here. It was moist and it felled of the bone. Also, perfectly salted.\n\nService was great, staff is kind and attentive! The only downside is the cocktails not up to par, but the General Manager came say hi and explained that they're about to launch a craft cocktail program, very experienced and professional individual and also a certified sommelier, He recommended a glass of wine that really hit the spot instead of the overly sweet taste less Strawberry margarita!\n\nI'm so happy we got to eat here - I had dinner with a friend but I'm planning on coming again with my spouse.\n\nAlso, my Persian friends said they love this spot so that's all I really need to confirm this place is legit!",

The ambience is perfect for a date night! However, if you want to go with family, then I will suggest to reserve table 1 because it can accommodate up to 5 people and is in a separate room from the main dining area. The manager and the servers are very welcoming. \n\nEach and every dish we ordered turned out really tasty. Sadly, they didn't have a vegetarian option on their entree menu but that wasn't a problem at all because they have a delicious falafel appetizer and various veggie sides. I was well satisfied with my entree of Bakhtiyari kabob as the meat was tender and flavorful. Please be careful with their hot sauce because even though it is tasty, it is extremely hot. \nThe best part of the dinner experience was the dessert! When our server said there will be a 15 minutes cooking time for their most popular dessert, I was going to ask for the check but then I thought of giving it a try. I am so glad I waited and tried it, the saffron ice cream was mind blowing and the chocolate tarragon cake was heaven! I would go back any day for this cake.",

The lamb chops are my favorite and they are huge. Everybody loves the salmon pasta so you can't go wrong with that either. Hookahs are reasonably priced. They still don't have ketchup even though they have potatoes that need some type of sauce. Bring your own :) I also came one time and they were out of lamb but just make sure you check if that's what you really want.\n\nMake sure you make reservations or be prepared to wait all night. I would have given 5 stars but they need a better way of managing the amount of traffic they have. One time valet was full and I had to park across the street and pay at Havana club and walk back. On multiple occasions I wanted to smoke hookah and couldn't due to them not being able to accommodate even though I put it in the reservation and called ahead.",

I was seated next to an employee who was off for the day and he recommended the lamb saying it was the best on the menu.

A friend had a bday dinner in one of the upstairs private rooms.\n\n It was a wait about 20 min even though the entire party of 10 people was on time. Still we had to wait. Waiters were passing us by with food constantly as we stood waiting. \n\nOnce seated I never had to look at the menu, I just remembered what looked good, as the waiters were in and out the kitchen headed outside with full plates. \n\nThe private room we had felt slighlty claustrophobic to me. I dont have much else to say.\n\n The 3 stars are for the salmon fettucine dish. It was delicious. Our waiter/server was a cool guy he didnt speak good English but he handled everything with no problem. \n\nJust thinking about the salmon yum!  I would do a pick up order in a heart beat for that dish anyday.",
