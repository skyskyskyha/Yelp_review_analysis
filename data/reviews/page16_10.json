        "text": "Just WOW! This place ticks all the boxes for me. Setting is intimate with its low light. They have small, adjustable lamps at each table so you can still read your menu with ease, which I found thoughtful. \n\nThe food was so good - we ordered the ceviche, shaking beef and lamb chops. The ceviche has the perfect amount of spice. The tarp chips were to die for! The shaking beef was tender and perfectly cooked - I loved the acidity of the salad which paired well with the steam. The lamb chops portioning was a bit disappointing but the flavor was amazing! Loved the ratatouille on the side. \n\nTo finish off the night, we ordered the crème brûlée and I still am thinking about it. The best I've ever had! Their dessert menu was extensive and made it hard to decide, but I'm glad we got this because it far exceeded expectations. \n\nAs I was leaving, an employee stopped me and gave me a rose they had leftover from Valentine's day. Totally made my night!!! Will definitely be coming back super soon.",

        "text": "Le Colonial is one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta. The food is delicious, the ambiance is chill and upscale and the staff is amazing! \n\nI have been so many times now that I am only posting pictures from my first ever visit because I tend to order the same things once I like them.\n\nI always have the spicy chicken stir fry, it's spicy, lemongrassy and delicious af. Comes with a cute side of rice; honestly my fav chicken stir fry in the city. \n\nFor dessert, I get the pineapple upside cake. My God. It's amazing. To the point where I order it to go and still ask for the ice cream (I think coconut), knowing it will melt on the cake. \n\nThe drinks!! I get this passion fruit one (white silk dress) and the cranberry-cucumber one (Poire Marguerite), both delicious. \n\nThe staff!!! Keisha at the lounge bar is THE BEST! Marjorie and Alexis are the other amazing bartenders I've continually had GREAT service from. \n\nThe lounge is first come first serve and there's a dj on Fridays and Saturdays. Shoutout to dj Grace always curating a vibe. \n\nBetween the combination of delicious food, cute and upscale ambiance, amazing staff, this is my go to places, especially when folks visit from out of town.",

The ribs and tuna tartare were by far my favorite items on the menu. The lychee martini was probably the best I've had in Atlanta to date. Our waiter peeped my love for lychees and brought me a ton more for my second and third rounds. & if a menu has creme brûlée I will always try it, and Le Colonial's did not disappoint. We sat on the patio and got to see a beautiful view of the sunset. This is a great spot to go to with friends or even on a date. I am very excited to go back!",

Le Colonial never disappoints. My favorite cocktails include the French Martini as well as the white silk dress. Both are packed with flavor and a taste that will knock you off your feet (lol) tonight was the first time I actually ordered an entree. I usually just order a ton of small plates. The spicy chicken soup OMG one of my favorite dishes, as well as the baby back ribs, chicken dumplings, and chicken and mushroom ravioli. I highly doubt anything on the menu will be a disappointment. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Le Colonial can be great for a date night or a fabulous dinner with the girls",

Service today was offensive. \n\nThey have a dress code which is subjective at best. I was told I'm not up to code because I was wearing active (actually) dress pants. We were all nicely dressed. We had to call the manager to who said it was okay but obviously was not pleased at our complaints. \n\nThen, we were treated like second class citizens throughout the whole meal. Poor service, poor attitude, poor everything. I was given stained plates 3 times before I just relented and wiped the chili oil off the plate and just started eating because the meal was out and already getting cold. Not a mention of apology or acknowledgment that this is odd. Our server did not check on us throughout the whole meal. \n\nThis was the tone of the whole meal. Offensive and vindictive for no reason. It was nauseating.",

For one of the drinks we asked if one of their mock tails could be made into a cocktail - so they charged $11 for the mock tail AND an additional $18 to turn it into a cocktail... ie they charged $29 for one drink, more expense than any other cocktail on their menu.

I'm over it. \n\nPlease note that I prefer to always give a positive review but here we are. The gentleman at the door greeted me with poor customer service. He mentioned that Hats weren't allowed. As I forgot to take the take off, this \"greeter\" came over extremely aggressive, raised his voice, was extremely embarrassing and disrespectful. No one combated him or talked back orrr said a word but he KEPT TALKING AND RAISING HIS VOICE. I SAID NOTHING!!!! With that said, I'm pissed and his lack of customer service will have me NEVER coming back to\nThis whack establishment.  Who wants to eat angry?!!Not me.  The customer service in general was basic. Let see what this food is about. (I ONLY stayed for my friends).",

I was expecting to pay around $45 but I'm guessing the price increased during the pandemic or they must have flew that baby in fresh from the Caribbean lol. \nSome of the items I tried include; garlic noodles, crispy brussel sprouts, grilled japanese eggplant, and signature fried rice. All the dishes were amazing. Drinks to btw. \nThe restaurant has an amazing lounge. The lounge hours are Monday-Saturday 5pm-7pm. $5 draft beers, $8 cocktails & wines, $8 bar bites. On Mondays the restaurant offers 1/2 off all bottles of wine under $100 both in the lounge & restaurant. Also, the restaurant does validate parking which gets you $3 off the cost of parking. According to the validation ticket you can send a text to request your vehicle and the valet will notify you when your car is ready.",

My favorites to start: a Lychee Martini and the Goi Con Chilled Shrimp Rolls paired with the Cari Tom Green Shrimp Curry a followed by a scoop of Pistachio Ice Cream. \n\nAs a best practice when considering a fine dining restaurant, it is suggested to preview the menu and dress code before making your reservation.

        "text": "Food was good pricey the lychee martini was good but the drinks are insanely overpriced. The service was that of Chilis the waitress didn't even tell us her name so spiel no recs just drinks, order, check. For over 200 for two people I expect more. Not the mention the waitress STOLE FROM ME!!! She was left $50 cash on $200 and two days later I see she's also charged my card $40. After speaking with the manager and getting refunded he said it was an accident, anyone who's worked In service knows that impossible to accidentally enter a tip. There is way too many steps in the computer. Anyway I was offered a gift card as if I'd return. The $40 was refunded the next day after speaking on the phone but honestly this might be naive but I expected the whole check to be refunded after their staff literally stole from me. Wonder what happened to the waitress manager said nothing about repercussions just that \"he felt bad\".",

        "text": "Every time I go here I receive a 5 star experience. The food... the ambiance... the service.... Everything is top notch! They have the most amazing tuna tartare and that is always my go-to. I've also had the dumplings, grilled sesame beef rolled flat noodle & pork ribs for starters which were good as well. The seafood ceviche was mediocre to say the least. For main entrees I've tried the beef noodles, fried rice, spicy chicken stir-fry  & whole fried snapper all of which were amazing. As a side I always order brussel  sprouts. They are extremely strict on dress code. I was coming from a pedicure appointment last time I went for lunch and they almost didn't let me in. If it wasn't for the reservation I had made I do think they would have turned me away. My go-to drunk is the leeche martini but I've also had 2 of their specialty drinks one of which I can't recall the name that was super strong and the other one was dark liquor with an egg white topping. They have valet parking up front I believe it's $2-$5. But they also have a parking deck that is not free. Overall 5 stars.",

When I come back, I fully plan on ordering 2 of those as my entree lol. \n\nI also tried the duck and the sea bass. They were both decent, but I wasn't wowed. The flavors were delicious but restrained- too restrained for my liking. I expected to be smacked in the face with flavor and they were both just a bit lackluster. \n\nI will be back to try their food again, hopefully I will have an entree that is more aggressive in the flavor department.",

We had a reservation & went a bit early & ended up sitting in the lounge in the back, which we thought was beautiful!! We got seats at the bar, put our name in with the host for the lounge & were moved to a table after an hour & a half. the bar was comfortable though & we would have been happy to stay there but gave our bar seats to people waiting. The tequila drink was amazing! We got a few rounds just because it tasted so good. All of the food was amazing! Can't wait to go again.",

        "text": "I don't normally write reviews of lunch experiences because I find that it is difficult to gauge a restaurant for lunch. However for Le Colonial it definitely deserves one because (even though I wasn't terribly hungry) the decor, service, food and setting were absolutely off the chart! Interestingly enough I almost negated coming here because I have over the years never had a tasting for Vietnamese (although they term themselves French Vietnamese).\n\nLocated in Buckhead Village with other well known restaurant names (and I presume the Spanx headquarters) the area is beautiful. Taking the elevator to their upper floor location we were met by a beautiful dining room that was a Wow. We were asked at 12:00 pm if we had a reservation which was the only irritant for the overall experience but nonetheless were seated with no difficulty. \n\nOur server was Rudy who was an expert on all menu items and was extraordinarily helpful with suggestions. If I owned a restaurant Rudy would be the person I'd mirror (or try to steal) for my restaurant. Service was great.\n\nAll the food was consistently outstanding. Light, numerous flavors exploding in our mouths and just overall - what could I say? Just fantastic.\n\nWe had:\n\nChicken dumplings with their light dipping sauce - delicious.\n\nCha Gio Chay which were crispy vegetable \"hot\" rolls that came with lettuce and hot peppers with a light dipping sauce. Rudy told us to roll the vegetable roll in the lettuce and pepper (which I had not thought of and glad that he brought this up) which as I'm writing this I'm salivating over how good it was.\n\nFollowed up with Spicy Chicken Stir Fry which had a variety of great flavors - another highlight to the meal.\n\n... And Shaking Beef - the most tender bite size morsels of filet mignon cooked perfectly with greens in a very light and modest  vinaigrette. Again a winner!\n\nWe added to our main courses - garlic noodles - which you say how good can noodles be? Well try this and you'll find out! Absolutely a must.\n\nAnd Rau Xao - which was bok choy and broccoli - absolutely stupendous.\n\nOverall this was our best dining experience in Atlanta and one of the best meals I've had in years!\n\nLooking forward to them opening up in South Florida (Delray Beach) to be exact and to becoming a regular. \n\nThis is a must try! And Highly Recommended.",

Ordered the Coconut Chicken Soup. For only $10, it was more than enough to share and so flavorful. The best coconut soup that I have ever had! Plenty of chicken and mushrooms! Loved the mushrooms! I also tried the spring rolls and they were amazing! They're average size but full of meat and vegetables. Wrap them in lettuce & carrots and you're good to go.

We sat in the back area by the bar and it was super nice / glitzy vibes. I got a blueberry mocktail that was quite yummy and the chicken soup which was also good. I found out afterwards that there is a location in Chicago where I live so I will probably go there when I am back in town!",

        "text": "Made reservations....Went here for lunch, glad I did!\nAlmost didn't get let up at the elevator because the host said I wasn't dressed properly with flip flops on. He stated that the dress code is business casual and that my flip flops might be a problem. Turns out no one had an issue with them but him.\n\nAnyway I ordered a French Martini cocktail that was delicious. I also order the Tuna Tartare as an appetizer, was a little spicy but tasted great. \nFor lunch I went with the Atlantic Salmon, no complaints, very tasty. Ended my lunch with a Pineapple Coconut Cake topped with vanilla ice cream yummy!",
