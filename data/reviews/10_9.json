Giving it 1 star for the great wait staff we had, and best Lobster Bisque as usual, but was hoping for a great Lobster Roll too, but that was not the case!  Worst Lobster Roll all 3 of us have ever had!  (It ruined the whole experience, so can't give more stars.). It was Just a bun with plain lobster inside, with melted butter (not great butter either!) on the side - totally boring!   What made it even worse was that the lobster meat was the edge chewy pieces!  We had to spit out 80% of bites!  We'll hit Cousins next time for a real Lobster Roll!!  Caution!  Skip their boring-chewy-meat \"Lobster Rolls\"!!!",

Service was very friendly and the right amount of attentiveness.  We each ordered a basket of fried oysters with french fries and the fried calamari appetizer.  \n\nThe breading on both dishes were perfect; the right balance of flakiness, crispiness, and flavor.  We also really enjoyed the pinkish sauce that came with the calamari, and ended up asking for more to eat with our oysters since we're not fans of tartar sauce.  Portions were also pretty sizable with reasonable prices.  Overall a good experience that I'd definitely recommend.",

Strike one \n\nWe sat on the patio. It was nice but the waiter would vanish for 20 minutes at a time so we could not order more drinks \nStrike 2 \n\nWine came in a plastic cup. Never asked if I liked it and he put it in front of my guest who asked for water and she thought it was till she drank it. What if she was sober?  Huge strike number 3 \n\nWell it might have a lot of great reviews in four stars I question have a God all that because our experience was a real poor quality.

        "text": "I give Steamhouse Lounge a solid four stars. I like this place. The food, service, and atmosphere are all great.\n\nThis is a seafood restaurant and it's an Atlanta institution. It was originally located in Buckhead until moving to Midtown in July 2008. You've probably passed by the two-story, light-blue-colored building on West Peachtree St. It looks like a large house. These guys have hosted the Atlanta Oysterfest for 32 years running.\n\nValet parking is available for $2 plus tip. Metered street parking is also available right next to the restaurant on 11th St. Pay with your phone and monitor/add time to your meter using the Parkmobile app (zone 51106). I paid $3.30 for 1.5 hours of parking. Parking is free on Sunday.\n\nThe restaurant has a laid-back beach/dock house vibe. It's not pretentious or one of those new restaurants with a \"modern\" spin on things. It's old school and established. This is a casual, seat-yourself type place. There are two levels, each having its own bar, with multiple seating options and areas. There are TVs to watch sports and the second level has a spacious, L-shaped deck. The bartenders and servers are friendly and the ambiance is comfortable.\n\nOne thing I like about this place is that they're open late - until 11pm Sunday-Thursday and 12am Friday-Saturday.\n\nSteamhouse Lounge has a raw bar with oysters, clams, mussels, and shrimp ($12-30 each); fried seafood baskets ($10-15 each including fries), salads ($6-7 each), starters and bar food ($9-13 each) like crab dip, shrimp and scallop quesadillas, and oysters various ways (e.g. Oysters Rockefeller); their famous award-winning lobster bisque (from $5 a cup to $17 per quart); seafood sandwiches, burgers, and tacos ($9-20 each) such as lobster rolls, Baja fish tacos, and Louisiana-style po' boys; entrees like seafood boils, shrimp and grits, and snow crab; and desserts ($5-6 each) like pie and cheesecake. Drink-wise, the bar offers a variety of local, domestic, and import beer plus wine and cocktails.\n\nThere are also seasonal beers (local stuff like Terrapin, Scofflaw, and Red Hare) and daily specials. When we visited, the daily specials were:\n\n* Monday - 1 lb of snow crab with size for $15 (regular price for 1.5 lb snow crab with two sides is $34), $5 Goombay Smashes (regularly $8)\n* Tuesday - $1.50 beers\n* Wednesday - 1 dozen raw or 1/2 dozen chargrilled oysters for $9 (regular price for 1 dozen raw oysters is $18), $4.50 house wine\n* Thursday - $5 featured drink\n\nWe ordered a dozen raw oysters ($18) and they were fresh and delicious. While not among the best oysters I've had, they were fair for the price. They were Gulf oysters, mild in flavor and brine. I'd say they were average in size. They were shucked nicely and served atop a bed of ice with lemon wedges and two ramekins, each with cocktail sauce and horseradish.\n\nI had the New Orleans po' boy ($11) made with fried catfish, remoulade, lettuce, and tomato with a side of hush puppies. Other po' boy options include fried oysters and shrimp. The po' boy was delectable, but messy to eat. The fried catfish fillet was ginormous and oversized for the sandwich bun (a good problem to have). It had a scrumptious batter and was well-seasoned with good flavor. Very meaty and yummy.\n\nThe hush puppies were excellent. I grew up eating hush puppies at The Hungry Fisherman in the 80s and Steamhouse Lounge's hush puppies are some of the best I've had anywhere. I highly recommend them. I got four with my po' boy order. They were served warm, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and tasted amazing.\n\nMy fiancee had the lobster bisque and salad (cup of bisque, $10) and really enjoyed it. She said it was good. I'm allergic to lobster so I didn't try it. Big portion on the salad that came with the bisque. It contained iceberg lettuce, cucumber, diced tomato, and shredded cheese. My fiancee got balsamic as the dressing. The salad was tasty with fresh and crisp veggies.\n\nOur primary server was Philip though more staff than just he served us. Everyone we interacted with was nice and did a fine job.\n\nI look forward to returning, especially on a Wednesday for that one dozen raw oysters for $9 deal.",

It's casual, seat yourself Cheers Iike atmosphere. \n\nWe started our meal with the famous lobster bisque and cheese toast.  The bisque was delicious  and did not disappoint.  I'm used to bisque being thicker this was not but I did not mind it was yummy and full of lobster! Mom was a little upset that hers wasn't as meaty. That did not stop her from taking a cup to go...wish I had...lol The cheese toast was a perfect combination. Mom ordered a spinach salad and side of shrimp. I ordered the catfish basket and an electric lemonade (drink special).  My drink was just ok but I'm a former bartender so there's that. The shrimp were crunchy and tasty.  The catfish was ok but let's just say I should have ordered the shrimp. We love a good tarter sauce but can't put this one on the list. \n\nSo all in all, I enjoyed my visit, the relaxed setting and would come back for bisque, shrimp and salad for sure.",

I got the fried calamari, someone else got the fried oysters, there was also crab stuffed shrimp and shrimp and scallop nachos. Everything that I just listed was delicious, fresh and presented so nicely. We also sat and ate on their beautiful balcony. The salmon dinner I ordered was excellent, I could not put my fork down. I would love to come here again. Great service as well! very friendly!",

We decided to sit inside as it was a bit too hot outside for me. LoL!\n\nThe service was very upbeat and inviting from the beginning. Our server took our drink orders immediately. She had an opinion on everything on the menu I asked her about. I ended up with the Grouper Finger meal per her feedback and I was very pleased with my decision. \n\nThe Grouper was golden fried. Moist and flaky on the inside. The French Fries were perfectly seasoned and done to perfection. I ordered the cheese toast as well, it could use a lot more cheese but it was good overall. \n\nI will definitely be returning. \n\nEnvironment- 8/10\nService- 10/10\nFood- 10/10\nValue- 9/10",

It's a relaxed restaurant with *great* food but also an enjoyable local, yet calm bar scene. It was refreshing! Chris - the bartender who was working was exceptional. My drink was wonderful. Food, again, was immaculate. 10/10 would recommend. (Get the grilled garlic parm oysters and a bowl of their famous lobster bisque, you won't be disappointed!!!)",

Peachtree that is $5. Both options are incredibly convenient.\n\nWe have been here multiple times and their menu options are a hit or miss. To me, their \"hit\" items are all of the fried baskets, Lobster Bisque, hush puppies, or the oysters (raw or baked). So basically everything unhealthy lol. \n\nI recently got the Mahi Mahi blackened and thought the fish was incredibly dry. So I wouldn't necessarily recommend any of the fish options here. They have lots of options available for those that want a healthier option, but it's definitely not the tastiest item on the menu.",

        "text": "The family and I have visited Steamhouse a few times before and it's always a pleasant experience! This time around we had Carl as our waiter and our service was impeccable. We had our toddler with us and he made sure she was happy and entertained from the very moment he greeted us at the table. He went above and beyond by bringing her juice out to keep her occupied while we looked over the menu, having her food come out first so she could finally get her fee fies (also known as french fries) she'd been asking about all day, and offering to put one of the TV's on Disney channel for her to enjoy while she ate. As a parent I appreciate those acts immensely. Now on to the food! If you're a seafood lover Steamhouse is your spot. They serve everything from fish and shrimp dishes to crab cakes, oysters, and seafood boils. They also have an array of beer, wine, and specialty drinks. To start off the night we ordered a 1800 Texas margarita ($14) and a Coco Le mango cocktail ($8.50). The margarita was delicious as always so no complaints there but the Coco Le mango was too sweet and tasted like plain old juice. It was still tasty and I love a good tropical juice but I need my cocktails with some kick to it...I need to taste the liquor. For our appetizer we ordered the spicy shrimp and scallop nachos ($13). They were amazing and a good size to be just an appetizer! For our entrees we decided on 2 fried catfish baskets ($13 each) one with pepper jack grits added on ($4). The catfish was large and well seasoned but a bit overly breaded. The fries were crispy, crinkle cut, and lightly sprinkled with a nice spice blend. The grits were nice, thick, and creamy but needed more pepper jack cheese. While everything I've tried on the menu so far has been pretty good, I definitely have my absolute favorites which is what keeps me coming back.",

We ordered a bottle of Sauv Blanc, enjoyed the sunny patio and some peel and eat shrimp. \n\nHadn't been here in years, and while nothing was particularly wrong, prob will keep checking out new spots for happy hour hours. \n\nThe service was efficient and kind. But the plates are plastic, and that's just a quality thing for me personally. \n\nI'd love to see some dishes and better glassware here... or if it stays the same, a killer happy hour.

        "text": "This was a loooonnnggg drive for some lobster bisque.  My boyfriend was craving some of this, and he said they had the best he's ever had.  Okay, when you hear words like that, it automatically makes you want to try it.  So off we went.  Parking wasn't too bad, actually found a metered spot, and it wasn't crazy, $4 for two hours.\n\nThe restaurant has both outdoor and inside seating, but it was chilly, and the outdoors appeared to not be open.  The place is kind of divey.  I mean, it's certainly not a place where you need to dress up.  In fact, I would feel out of place if I had.  We sat at a high top, and the chairs were uncomfortable.  I also felt like the floor was kind of off, because I felt like I was going to slide down outta my chair at any moment.   Service was also subpar.  She just didn't seem to care about the lack of space on the table, considering there were three of us and things like mussels with an extra bowl take up a lot of room.  She was never in a hurry to clear anything either.\n\nNow for the bisque...I really was disappointed, and I'm not sure if it's like when you go to the movies and you hear amazing things prior to seeing the show that it's automatically always a letdown but I felt the bisque was overrated.  Now, I know I am in the minority of patrons here on this opinion. It did have a lot of lobster meat in it, but flavor-wise, I felt it was just okay.  Three bites, and I was good, and I think the two latter were to reconfirm that it wasn't all that great.  Sorry.  I will say my boyfriend really enjoyed it.\n\nThe rest of the food was equally so-so, and the rum punch was lacking in well...PUNCH.  Not sure if there was rum or not in there.  We had the mussels, which I did not care for the broth.  We also had some grits, which were pretty bland.  The lobster roll was tasteless to me, but the price was decent.  I also tried an oyster with cheese that was just okay, didn't really leave me wanting more.  \n\nSubpar meal, disappointing at best.",

My friend recommended Steamhouse because he had been before and mentioned that on Mondays they did a special on crab legs. (A pound and a side for $20!). Sold on that from the jump!\n\nOur server was Dean, and he was simply the kindest, patient, and most accommodating. Also had a great sense of humor! We sat outside on the upper deck area which offered great fresh air and some city ambiance. We started with the Spicy Shrimp & Scallop Nachos which were simply soooo delicious and full of flavor! Very shareable, but so good you might over eat your shared portion!\n\nWe then each ordered the pound of crab legs and had our own individual sides of corn, cheese toast, and pepper jack grits. We were all satisfied with our sides, me in particular definitely enjoyed the cheese toast. Butter and lemon is provided with the old bay seasoned crab legs that were very fresh and steamed properly. We topped off the nice with the Grilled Garlic Parmesan Oysters which were soooooo savory! Grilled just right, and was a nice change from traditional 'slimy'/cold oysters that I've had before.\n\nCompletely satisfied with Steamhouse and will be back again soon!",

We are very happy with the amount of seafood that was in the steamed sampler, only downside was the mussels were very small. If you prefer to eat seafood for its natural taste rather than for a strong seasoned flavor, I highly recommend the steam. The lobster roll was absolutely delicious and had a very generous amount of lobster per roll. The best was the lobster bisque which was flavorful of lobster with a nice creamy taste. Food was ready for for pick after fifteen minutes and was nicely packed and ready to go when I arrived. They put all the sauces and lemons in an open container at the top of bag, I would've appreciated if the lemons were in a closed container. Other than that I am very happy with this place and will definitely go again!!",

I don't have anything to really complain about except the food... it made me too full! Haha! \n\nWe ordered the spicy shrimp and scallop nachos, omg, it was really really good, perfect amount of cheese and toppings although next time I will ask for no scallions on top. \n\nWe also got the cold crab dip. That was surprisingly good too! When all you're eating is cold oysters, and then you have the hot flat bread with the dip, it's so yummy! \n\nCrab cake is probably the best I've ever had! You can get a piece of crab in every bite. My boyfriend ordered a cup of chili that he shared with the guys. \n\nStay away from the nachos though!! It wasn't the best. We ordered the shrimp nachos and the mahi mahi. 3tacos per order. Actually the shrimp taco is not bad but the guys said the mahi mahi had an awful stench to it. \n\nFor desert, the girls got key lime pie, which I would have like if it was more on the tangy side, and the guys got the chocolate peanut butter mousse that they absolutely enjoyed, my boyfriend said it tasted like a Reese's peanut butter cup. \n\nBetween the the four of us (there were six but two female friends don't like oysters), we ordered 8 dozen oysters, definitely could have ordered more but we just had so much food! Waited all year long until the waters was cool enough for these babies. Definitely hit the spot! Give it a try if you're craving oysters on a Wednesday night!",

        "text": "This is a frequent spot for me and I have attended the Oysterfest 3 years in a row. Today, I stopped by to grab a drink....maybe two and some oysters. I sat outside and was greeted by two 2 waiters for my order. I ordered calamari, mango beer and an order of oysters with garlic and parmesan cheese. Now, I gave it a 3 because there was hair baked in my oysters and on the cloth napkin. Well I let the waiter know and he quickly resolved the situation. It was a nice day to sit outside and have a craft beer or two. They brought another order of oysters with no hair and the manager came out and apologized. It's a fav of mine and I will return. The waiter was nice too and even though the food wasn't on point this I still left him 40%. I'll be back!!",

        "text": "So amongst the few hundred pics in my phone of food from establishments that I've yet to review, I ran across an oldie, but goodie! Shame on me for not doing this review soon, as I've been patronizing this joint for years; at least five plus (5+) years. \n\nOn to the food...I'm a fan. The lobster bisque is unique, but in a good way. Definitely lobster in every bite and it seems to be a favorite as I've seen several tables order it. The oysters also seem to be a hit here. On this particular visit I accompanied the bisque with a lobster roll. Not much to say, but get it. Served on a warm poppyseed bun with a good amount of meat with the butter and mayo (optional) on the side. \n\nIf you're in the Midtown area stop by and give them a try. They have seating downstairs, upstairs, and outdoors. Would've given them four (4) stars, but they do not have draft beer. Hey, it's important people!! Btw, I sat at the bar...",

The sever had several tables she was trying to handle at the same time. My drink kept coming out wrong, I'm not sure why there were so many issues when all I asked for was Soda water with lime and lemon lol. We also had to get another waiter to give us refills.\n\nI got the lobster rolls w. fries and it was about $18. Hubster got a catfish Po Boy and it was about $12. The catfish was huge. The lobster was a little plain so ask for the jalapeño tartar sauce to go with it and a lemon. All together we spent $35. \n\nI'm glad that we finally got a chance to try it, but I definitely wouldn't return.",
