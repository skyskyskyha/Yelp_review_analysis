        "text": "BRUNCH!\n\nWe're living the GOOD LIFE with an epic brunch spread and a couple of friends! Hanging out with our fave, the Pimenton Chicken Biscuit that's a flaky and buttery biscuit with a sweet and spicy tender fried chicken and savory egg. It's a winning combo. Or digging into the fantastic avocado toast that explodes with flavor, chunky and creamy guacamole, and the perfect pickled onion on the top! Sweet, tangy, creamy. Top it all off with the perfect bottomless mimosas and we're in for a spectacular Sunday Funday.\n\nWe also got to try:\nGrilled Salmon Eggs Benedict had perfectly cooked egg on top of a tender, flaky piece of grilled salmon and topped with delicious hollandaise. On the sweet side, the French Toast has it all, a good sweetness paired with a savory-ness from the toast and a good tang on the end. We ordered both vegan sausage and Butifarra Sausage to pair with this! The vegan sausage made with @beyondmeat had more flavor than you could imagine and the regular was meaty, hearty and the perfect pair with the syrup from the toast!\nLove potatoes, shoot for the Tortilla Espanola that a simple savory egg and potato goodness rolled into layers and make for a hearty, savory, creamy bite. Or even opt for something a little healthy with Yogurt Parfait that's rich, crunchy, bright, tangy! \n\nCocktail: Honey Bear: this cocktail had all the lemon and honey flavors. Sippable!",

For it to be crispy chicken and so heavily seasoned it's always juicy and delicious.\n\nShort Rib - this is my favorite dish. The short rob kind of reminds me of oxtail.

So we're the churros! Amazing and not crispy. The server gave me a handwritten birthday card as soon as we got seated Which was much appreciated.

        "text": "No better place to spend an evening with an incredible group of people who I was so lucky to have the chance to catch up with while in Atlanta. They recommended this little gem, as it was close to downtown and I was visiting for work. None of us had ever been and the hype surrounding this place was REAL.\n\nUpon entrance my \"photo opp\" eyes lit up for their Te Quiero Mucho garden wall which NATURALLY, we used for several pictures later (and I do mean several).\n\nWe were sat a high top near the bar area which was just enough room for the five of us. The servers brought over water right away which was very attentive, and let everyone settle in. We started with a pitcher of margs which the group felt tasted a little \"cleaning product\" if you will... I think the sweet and sour was just a bit harsh. We ended up switching to pitchers of sangria instead, which everyone seemed to love. After drinking for a while, we were super pumped that the bar manager notified us it was half price bottle of wine night... but we really wish we had been told upon sitting. Nevertheless, we got a few amazing reds for the table per his recommendation and we were able to opt for the more expensive stuff since we were being given such a nice discount.\n\nOnto the food. In true Tapas style, we all ordered a few items that tickled our fancy. We started with the charcuterie board which was perfect in every way. We then moved onto the broccolini, potatoes, scallops, and fried chicken. I have to say.. the portions were a LITTLE smaller than I expected, but heck we just kept ordering more food. In my opinion, the Brussels sprouts, Broccolini and chicken were the stars of the show. A little bit later we got some shrimp, braised short rib, beef tartare I believe it was... my lord. I am not a big meat person but everyone else really loved the juiciness and temp of these items.\n\nThe desserts were 100% rich but 100% worth it. We tried one of each I think... starting with the brownie (female, I've learned, since it doesn't have nuts, haha) and creme brûlée and pistachio cheesecake. I was Team Pistachio Cheesecake. It was sweet and crunchy and delicious, yet smooth and simple! Yes!\n\nAlex was one of a kind (he kept coming from behind the bar to check on us and make sure we were loving everything, on top of continuously recommending amazing options, drinks and food alike)! Thank you for making our visit so special - we really felt that you cared about our time and during the pandemic while everyone is so overworked, customer service of this kind is very hard to come by. We will definitely return (likely the ATL group before me) but I'm in town for work twice a year so I'll have to impress some customers and bring them this way!",

The only thing I didn't like much was the margarita, which was a pity, but it was very watered down and not very nicely done. Since they were very busy I will say it could be due to that so I might try again. \nBefore we left we were offered, by who I think was the manager, a taste of one of their sweet vermouth, which was a really nice gesture that I haven't seen in restaurants in a long time. \nAnother great thing is that parking was very convenient without hassle of Inman park, PCM or west midtown.

There's also parallel parking options on Rankin Street and Wilmer Street.\n\nFood: I ordered the Salmon Benedict, which was delicious.

The food was meh back then but has since gotten a facelift. \n\nMy friend opted for wine while I chose the standard delivery of calories to my belly. Beef tartare over bone marrow?!! What in the world?!! Gorgeously good. It was my friends first time ever trying beef tartare and although she was a bit apprehensive, she soon had no problem helping me scrape the plate into our respective mouths. We also had the creamy rice, crispy chicken, eggplant montadito, and mushrooms croquettes. All really great dishes in their own right. My only gripe with the montadito was that there was too much sesame brittle and it masked the eggplant. \n\nThere was a special that we were so lucky to try. Braised pork belly in a chickpea soup that was delishhhhhhh. We ordered some grilled bread to sop up the broth and it was everythinggggg. Would definitely come back again. Service was excellent!",

It also had a fried egg on it. \n\nI also ordered the Three Amigos to drink, which is Casamigos Reposado Tequila, orange juice, lemon, cinnamon, & orange. Super good & strong! \n\nOverall, it was good time. A smooth 3.5.",

I had heard good things but didn't realize it was be this good!\n\nFirst off - Insta-worthy flower wall inside. Check. \nSecond - Insta-worthy outdoor dog friendly patio! Love it. \nThird - pretty and boozy cocktails for brunch and all day!\n\nI ordered the Valencia Spritz when I saw gin and spritz. It was boozy and tasty for sure, and went well with my entree, the steak and huevos! My go-to brunch entree is usually the steak and eggs, and I had heard so many good things about it... I think we had 5 orders of it at our table of 6. The steak AND the eggs were cooked perfectly. I loved the seasoning on the roasted mushrooms and fried potatoes on the side, too. THAT MOJO VERDE THO!!! Definitely a must order. \n\nCan't wait to stop in and check out more of their gorgeous cocktails and new dinner menu!",

However, the hostess did accommodate our request to sit in the room directly to the left once you enter the restaurant.\n\nOur server was more pleasant but wasn't the most attentive. My friends and I ordered different items. I went with the vegan grand slam, $15. It came with  scrambled eggs, sausage patties, potatoes, and a baby kale, mushroom and tomato mix. I substituted real eggs for the vegan. The portion was generous! The entree was delicious and filling. I wasn't able to finish the entire plate.\n\nI loved the unique offerings and the vegan/vegetarian options and would return to try other items. The prices were also reasonable.",

It's located right off the beltline so there's a lot to do around. The restaurant is beautiful for a date night or special occasion. I ordered a bunch of tapas because I was craving Spanish food. The pan con tomate was delicious and very fresh. The tortilla española was very good but the slice could be bigger! Overall amazing food and definitely recommend the huevos estrellados.",

So many great photo opps here. \nThe brunch menu wasn't very big but had very unique offerings. I didn't opt for a cocktail but they had an entire back page on brunch drinks, and even a CBD concoction. I tried the chicken and biscuit. I found it a bit dry, both the biscuit and the chicken, but thought the fruit portion was adequate. \nOur server only stopped by to take our drink and food order and we were left with empty water glasses the majority of the meal. \nI appreciate the aesthetic, I only wish the staff was more friendly and available.",

        "text": "Flavors were unanimously delightful.  It is rare and wonderful that we, as non meat-eaters, can enjoy tapas so much.  We ordered a variety of seafood (octopus, mussels, ceviche, and garlic shrimp) and vegetarian dishes (Bomba rice, mushroom croquetas, Brussels sprouts and a golden beet salad) and they were all tasty, and that's without having any of the meats or cheeses that are their specialty. \n\nThat being said, the evening could have been so much more enjoyable if ...\n... if our table had been ready when we arrived at 8 pm. If I have to wait 30 minutes, what is the point of a reservation? There were empty tables in our seating area when we were finally shown there. Seems like just disorganization causing us to eat so late.\n... if they had not been out of two of the dishes we wanted to order. \n... if portions were more generous. The special of the night, golden beets in a chimichurri sauce, turned out to be $15 for 1 beet divided into 6-8 pieces. In general, when the dishes cost $15 each, an average of 2 dishes per person should be enough food. It wasn't. We needed to order 3 dishes per person, so the bill including wine was close to $300 for 4 of us. Not gonna be doing that every week!",

We figured it would be crowded for memorial weekend but at lunch it wasn't too bad.\n\nWe sat outside at the patio and it was nicely decorated. Our service was ok, sometimes it would take a bit long to get something we ordered. Except for alcohol, that was brought out promptly.\n\nI ordered the patatas bravas and the two dipping sauces it came with were amazing. One of my friends got the mushrooms croquettes and she said \"I thoroughly enjoyed the outer shell and as it broke it introduced me to a mushroom euphoria. The taste was dancing on my tongue and the mashed potato below it was great to dip into\". The flan French toast was also tasty and not too sweet and enough for two to share. The grits were kind of bland as a side though. The mimosas we got were pretty good and strong and we ended up each having 5 in the 90 minutes of bottomless.\n\nThere's parking at this location as well and 2 hours are free with validation. The location is on the beltline and is walkable to other breweries and restaurants. Overall a great spot for nice weather.",

The eggs benedict was a little underwhelming, but the jamon serrano was perfectly smoky and paired nicely with the yolk. My steak was a bit tough and overcooked for my liking. It was also pretty salty, but the mojo verde that it comes with definitely helps balance it out. I loved the potatoes in both dishes. The mushroom croquettes might have been my favorite of the meal. It was perfectly fried, creamy, sweet, and savory. We paired everything with some mimosas and had a great time. We would definitely want to come back to try their dinner options.",

It was pre V-day week and they were pretty full.\n\nWe were seated upstairs which was a bit isolated so next time we would definitely request a table in the bar area for some people watching.\n\nThe drinks were OK. I tried Madrid Manhattan at first but did not enjoy it, and the server was kind enough to swap it for a margarita.\n\nFor tapas we ordered hangar steak, scallops, seviche, and octopus. The food was awesome. I can't even pick a favorite. \n\nOverall: street parking, patio, full bar, great food and service. Will be back in summer after a beltline stroll :)",

Vibrant indoor seating and bar as well as an open spacious outdoor area. \n\nI hadn't heard about it previously but glad I finally did! We had a rambunctious group of 8 on a busy Friday afternoon but the staff was able to sit us and accommodate us immediately. Our server was pleasant and patient and felt like an old friend. The drinks were quick and delicious. We all ordered many tapas as well and even ordered seconds as they were that good. \n\nI'll definitely be back for another round at Buena Vida and definitely recommend this laid back spot.",

LoL!\n\nUpon arriving, the visual presentation is stellar. I'm talking about an open environment. Belt line view. Great design esthetic and ample seating. They have packed a powerful punch in such a quaint location. \n\nUpon being seated we were greeted by our server, Rain and he was amazing from the beginning. He approached with a welcoming greeting, you could feel the smile beneath his mask. He knew the menu inside and out and provided great recommendations. \n\nI ended up with the following items,\nBrussel Sprouts\nShort Rib\nHanger Steak\n\nEverything was AWESOME. I'm talking about a robust combination of flavors that come together within each dish and provide your mouth and stomach with a beyond enjoyable experience. It's as if each dish is crafted for maximum flavor attack and is created to melt in your mouth and make your stomach say \"ooh!\"\n\nThe plates are small in size but HUGE in Flavor and Temperature perfection. The Short Rib is melt in your mouth tender and sits in a savory sauce that makes you swallow slowly and enjoy it as it sits in your mouth. \n\nThe Hanger Steak is a desirable cut of meat that hits your tongue and lets its presence be known. I'm talking, here to stay, hear me roar, flavor abundance with a well rested tenderness that makes the chew pure bliss. \n\nYou must stop in and give this place a try. \n\nFood- 10/10\nService- 10/10\nEnvironment- 10/10\nRecommend- Absolutely",

        "text": "This place sucks. All the people in the reviews who are like \"Omg, such an elevated dining experience\" really need to get off instagram (the restaurant has this trendy flower wall that people seem to love to snap photos in front of endlessly?) and experience some real fine dining to compare it to. I'm 6 months pregnant and as soon as I sat down in my chair, I was poked by a nail, snagged my dress, and scratched up the back of my knees because the straw-like material on the cheap tacky rattan chairs was poking all out of the edge of the seat. \n\nAfter switching out my chair, we were approached by a COMPLETELY expressionless server who barely lifted her eyes off the floor and didn't even come close to smiling once. I know her name but I won't call her out like that. But come on girl, we're a party of 8 people, you're about to make some money, would it kill you to bring some energy? Or at least like a basic level of friendliness? It was awkward how serious she was.\n\nI ordered a mocktail, but they said they ran out. I ordered another mocktail (tiki tango), and it was absolutely disgusting. It tasted like half grapefruit juice, half water, at room temp, and had a tiny, soggy, wilted flower tossed on top that I had to dig out. It wasn't even in a pretty glass, just a regular water glass. Like, it's alcohol-free, can you at least make it pretty and fun? Or at least make it taste ok? I sent it back and we got a bunch of tapas. The other people in my party of 8 all said their drinks were weak and pretty tasteless as well. \n\nWe got about 8-10 different dishes. The only thing that was really good was the crispy pimento chicken. The patatas bravas was good, but not anything super special. The salmon was wayyyyyy too salty. The jackfruit tacos (recommended by the waiter) were literally INEDIBLE. They tasted like if you ate a bagged salad with no dressing and threw some unsalted cat food on top. Seriously I am not a picky eater at all and I was hungry, but I had to push this one aside, it was BAD BAD. Super weird how much the sever was pushing it, too? Y'all there is so much good food I'm Atlanta, there is so much \"elevated dining\" in this city to choose from, and this AINT IT!!! The prices are also outrageous for the quality and size. I'm the first one to happily blow my money on a good food & drink experience but this one left me feeling so regretful.",

        "text": "While visiting family, we had the pleasure of enjoying a meal at Buena Vida Tapas, off the Beltline. The food was tasty! We hadn't had patatas bravas since our trip to Barcelona in 2015 so it was a nice surprise to find it on the menu! But the best part of the meal was Shane, our waiter. What a nice guy! Shane went above and beyond taking our orders, serving our food and fussing over us to make sure our meal was to our satisfaction. We chatted extensively about our shared experiences growing up in the North. He also shared a couple of the venues we should check out during our visit to Atlanta. Overall, it was a fantastic experience. 10/10 we'd visit again!",
