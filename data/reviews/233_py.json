The interior is post-industrial, with a vibe that appeals to those seeking a bit of edge in their dining experience.\n\nThe food at Rock Steady lives up to expectations, with a nice selection of dishes that hit the spot. The staff and patrons alike contribute to the friendly atmosphere, making it easy to feel welcome.\n\nHowever, despite the positives, there are some aspects of Rock Steady that fall short. Table reservations can be a hassle, and certain services can be lacking at times, which can be frustrating for patrons. In addition, while the live disc jockey adds to the atmosphere, table reservations can be a hassle - to me, it felt like a lottery to reserve a table. \n\nOverall, Rock Steady offers a memorable dining experience with its dark vibe, friendly people, and tasty food. Just be prepared to navigate some hiccups along the way.",

We stopped here for for brunch before enjoying a full day ahead. FYI: Valet parking only.\n\nWhat caught my eye was the d\u00e9cor; very chic and classy. During brunch, enjoy their small and large plates menu along with brunch cocktails such as their Rock Steady, Hot Stepper and Get Bent cocktails. They even have mocktails which are just as good. Don't leave without trying the Rock Steady cornbread which comes with tri-colored pepper jelly and whipped butter. So delicious! Their sweet potato french toast is a hit too as it's topped with rum syrup, lemon mascarpone and candied pecans. We definitely ROLLED out of here, haha!\n\nAt the end, the waiter brought out a candle and dessert for the beautiful bride to be since we were celebrating her birthday too! Rock Steady gets 5 stars in my book. Sending love from New Jersey!",

A seating arrangement where my neighbor coughed the whole evening and I just knew o was walking away with the cooties. \n\nThe ambiance is cute for a younger crowd, a crowd going on a first date or second date\u200d. Most of the younger people were on their phones and not even having conversations with their dates, so what do I know. \n\nBut them plantains!!!! Firm but not too firm, brown sugary goodness! I prefer my beef patties with a different crust, were more like empanadas and more bread than filling. The sweet potato cheesecake was no bake (I asked because I used to own a cheesecake company) and it was ok. My friend's food was good and plentiful for the price but she also stated the seating was tight and the music a tad too loud. \n\nThe drinks were good but couldn't taste or at least feel the alcohol afterwards. Caribbean drinks should burn just a little...smiling. \n\nI didn't go upstairs to the dance floor but heard that it's a great place to mingle.",

The food was so good (albeit expensive but bc we were in town visiting and it wasn't promoted, the manager accommodated us for the prix menu).  Since it was Valentine's Day, there was only one menu. It was set menu for $75 and included a starter, entree and dessert. \n\nWhen I go back to Atlanta, I'm definitely hitting up this place. The vibe was eighth, DJ was nice and food and drinks were delicious.  They also have an upstairs with all other DJ that's like a lounge, bar and club. There sofas everywhere. I didn't stay to enjoy that part bc I was exhausted, but my friends did and had a great time. \n\nPaid street parking is available. \nI highly recommend this place and will definitely be back to see how they are for non events. And kudos to the manager for accommodating our group!",

We started off with brussel sprouts and the lamb egg rolls of course. I decided to try the Rock Steady, their signature cocktail. It's definitely one of the best Pina Colada's I've had, super refreshing and as someone not a fan of coconut flavors, very delicious! \n\nOur main courses were the Jerk Grilled Chicken & the Spiced Wild Honey Shrimp. Both delicious were absolutely delicious LC with the Jerk Chicken being a little bit more spicy than the Shrimp. Our sever was great with helping us make decisions on what to eat. I've very pleased to say I've never had a bad time or meal here. The inside was beautiful and the music was great, making me wonder if there was a DJ anywhere. \n\nWe ended our meal with the Plantain Banana Pudding. I keep on saying everything is delicious, but it's so true! The ice cream on top was obviously homemade and the banana pudding fresh.\n\nAnyone in Atlanta has to make a visit to Rock Steady.",

We made a brunch reservation for noon, which is probably best if you have a large group. Please note that if at the time of reservation the upstairs \"lounge\" space is available they may offer you this. Honestly, just take the tables downstairs-if someone else comes and buys out the space you will not be up there. No biggie, but just be aware. \n\nWe had a lovely waitress whose name escapes me right now. She was very quick and attentive to my group. I ordered the Get Bent for my drink, which is a play on rum punch but literally will get you bent: it's made with Wray and Nephew overproof rum. If you know, you know. \n\nWe shared appetizers consisting of beef patties and janga dip. The janga dip is made with collards and crawfish. Who knew something with both of those ingredients could be so delicious! I want to come back just to get that to go. \n\nMy entree was the Haitian Fried Catfish. Very large portion as i had half to take back home and was DELICIOUS. \n\nParking situation is valet behind the restaurant for $15 or you can park on the street or parking garage across the street. I will return!",

I must've talked to 3 different people via phone and text messages to confirm my 8:30pm reservation for the gallery (lounge area upstairs). BTW the upstairs table has a minimum of $250, but I was told that our dinner can go towards it. \n\nWe get there and the hostess says, the upstairs doesn't open until 9pm and that my reservation was a typo. They offered that we can sit at the bar but the drinks ordered won't go towards the tab. We waited outside. \n\nWe went in and the hostess did not escort us to where we needed to go but just pointed to the door. We got our IDs checked and went upstairs. We were the only ones up there and we ordered hella food, the table barely fit everything. I'm glad we finished our food before it got poppin' because no one else was eating whole-ass meals in there, just drinking. \n\nThe music was on point. To no one's fault but my own, I left an extraordinary amount of extra tip when 20% was already included in the bill (normal for a big party and we were 6 girls). \n\nThe food was better than expected. They weren't lyin' when they said mango hot honey shrimp b/c baabbbyy! That was hot. The jalape\u00f1o calamari was sweet and savory, the curry pasta, to which we added crawfish, was filling and generous on the crawfish, the drinks were strong, and plantains and tostones were a nice way to finish it off. \n\nAll in all, while the logistics and initial customer service didn't leave a great first impression, we ended up having a great first night in ATL.",

Being a native South Floridian, Caribbean food is in my blood and one of my favorite types of cuisine to enjoy, so Rock Steady is always a nice idea. \n\nMy friend made reservations for 9pm and I believe that we were seated around 9:30pm. I won't put that on the biz as I think it may have been the fact that the birthday girl was delayed and I think they couldn't/wouldn't seat us until our whole party was there, which makes sense to me. Once she arrived, we were seated in about 10 minutes. One thing I don't love about Rock Steady, is that it's so cramped if you're not seated because it's always busy! (Good for them!) So while waiting around, you're struggling to leave space for people to get to the restroom, leave, get to the bar or the team taking dishes out to other patrons. But, it's not a dealbreaker of course. Once we were seated, we were immediately tended to by a nice young lady who did great with our 10-top table. \n\nThe menu is filled with some delicious options! I never know what to get there, despite reviewing the menu 10x+ before I even visited, lol. I ended up ordering a Caribbean 69, (a twist on my fave cocktail, the French 75) + the Griot plate with pikliz and tostones. The Caribbean 69 was delicious!! Strong but not overpowering, sweet, not in a champagne flute like French 75's but in a cognac glass which allowed for more of the drink. The griot was delicious and tasted different than any Griot that my Haitian friends have cooked. No comparison between the two because they are both delicious and made with love! The Pikliz, omg. I love Pikliz. Rock Steady's version had something different about theirs just like the Griot, but it was so good. I asked for extra Pikliz and the waitress made it happen with a huge bowl of it! When I got my receipt, I saw the $5 charge for it LOL. Totally worth it! \n\nOh - and the DJ! Wow. We were seated next to him and he was killing it. The mixes were blowing our minds during dinner, lol. I hope they keep him on staff for a long time.\n\nA great experience out!",

I really enjoyed the dim lighting & the music playing in the background but not too loud you can still enjoy a conversation w/ the person you're with. \n\nThe service was great we sat at the bar so they were constantly attentive to our needs for the most part. \n\nThe food was amazing the place was clean, I ordered the jerked lamb egg rolls w/ a side of tostones & sweet plantains. Everything was slapping ! 10/10 OMG.\nThe Order came out relatively fast from what I can remember & the portion of the food is big enough to share with someone or eat alone if you're hungry.\n\nOverall, I had an amazing time at rock steady we hit the club upstairs after for a turn up great way to end off the night.\n\nDefinitely Recommend !",

The flavors were enjoyable, and the dish was well-prepared, but it didn't quite justify the premium cost.\n\nIf you're looking for an indulgent treat and don't mind the expense, it might be worth trying, but there are more affordable options that offer a similar or better culinary experience.\n\nThe restaurant itself was quite loud and it was hard to carry a conversation with my peers due to the loud music, but it was all an experience.

From the ambiance to the music to the food and drinks...there has to be a reason for me to return.  We came in for a late dinner on a Tuesday night and I was immediately struck by the vibes of the caribbean/afro beats music.  Then the dimly lit ambiance was perfect for a date night atmosphere.  And I can honestly say that I would come back for our server, Tony, alone.  He was extremely knowledgeable of the menu so he as able to give us excellent drink and food choices.  We ordered three sharable small plates: Jerk Lamb Eggrolls, Crispy Beef Empanadas, and Peach Jalape\u00f1o Calamari.  Each dish was cooked top perfection and offered an array of flavors.  My only critique would be to add a sweet dipping sauce for the eggrolls.  It would offer a sweet and savory taste to the dish.  \n\nOther than that, I highly recommend Rock Steady and after reading the reviews about how popular this place is on the weekend (I'm sure it's because the Brunch is really a draw) I'd suggest coming in on a weekday so you can enjoy the full experience.",

                "text": "I visited Rock Steady during my visit to Atlanta on 3 occasions. I went for Saturday night out dancing, for Sunday Brunch and Thursday evening dinner. \n\nRock Steady has a downstairs area that is just a restaurant with a super dope ambiance. Perfect for date night because the lighting is dim with candlelight. The decor is Afro-modern and super artistic. And the upstairs is a lounge/club area. The food I had for brunch and when I came back for dinner was delicious. \n\nSaturday night was a blast. Drinks are pricey but the vibes were top notch and they played primarily Afro Beats, hip hop and reggae. \n\nSunday brunch was super chill and the service was really great. After eating we went ups stairs to have another drink and it seemed that the target crowd that day was 30+\n\nThursday night Dinner was super romantic and the service was AMAZING. I would absolutely recommend Rock Steady both for their food, restaurant service and also if you just want to have a fun night out. Will definitely be back.",

                "text": "This restaurant/club is a cool vibe for people who want to listen to music and enjoy some drinks. I could see myself returning for a couple drinks at the bar and then heading upstairs (if the DJ was good that night). The restaurant is dark and loud which makes it hard to have extensive conversations with the people at your table and even harder to read the menu. My group of 30-something year old all had to use our phones to read the menu and joked that we felt like our parents at a restaurant. \n\nThe drinks we good, there wasn't anything too special about them, but they were tasty. Based on the things we ordered, the only food I would get again was the beef empanadas and the jerk chicken. We also ordered the vegetable pasta and the fish and chips which no one finished.\n\nRight behind the food, the service was not great. While our server was pretty quick to take our food and drink order, all of the drinks came out at separate times and the food was the same so while some of us had our food, we had to wait almost 10 minutes for others to get their food. The most disappointing part was that as the server took away full plates because we did not like some of the dishes, they never asked how the food was or how our experience was...which I typically expect even if we ate all of the food on our plates. I will say the hosts were great and very friendly which started and ended our dining experience on a high note.\n\nAfter dinner we went upstairs to the lounge/club where it looked like you could order food but it was much more of a party vibe. There is only one small bar upstairs so it took a while to get a drink. The DJ on the night we went was absolutely horrible. All they played was mash-ups between multiple songs and jumped around genres the entire time we were there.",

Street parking was available within walking distance. \n\nI think pricing is typical for Atlanta. (Take that however you wish.)\n\nOur party ordered the catfish and grits. I liked it but my friend wasn't impressed. You'll see from my picture, I tore it up - as it was delicious - BUT, right when I got to the last bite (which I was excited about), I found a long straight strand of hair. Disappointing, to say the least. I informed our waiter about it and he \"jokingly\" said it was mine (\"You know that's your hair\"), picked up the plate, and asked if we wanted anything else. No apologies given. The lack of acknowledgment and accountability alone was enough to keep me from going back.",

Please make reservations or you'll be standing waiting on a table for a while. We had reservations & were taken to our table as soon as we got there.

It's def an after dinner lounge but we didn't care. 90 minute limit in seating and as the night went on completely understood why. That place got packed. We got a little bit of leeway on the time limit because we were still actively ordering.\n\nService our waitress was so sweet, knowledgeable, honest, and great recommendations, super attentive  but not annoyingly attentive make sure we had drinks at all times and just offered a really fun experience. \n\nFood: the LAMB EGG ROLLS were so good we got a second order. They were plentiful with filling, flavor and a very lightly hinted cilantro. So crispy and huge!! No complaint on the portion. Jerk wings: Womp Womp. They were these teeny tiny things.  Jerk chicken: humongous and delicious.  \n\nDrinks: mostly sweet, I'm not a huge sweet fan but the lychee martini and the margarita was tasty. \n\nEverything was amazing and the best dining experience I have had in a LONG time.",

                "text": "This is high-end, creative Carribean cuisine so brace yourself for innovative concepts in the menu. I visited here on a Saturday around 1pm for brunch, party of 2 with a reservation. We were quickly seated. Very nice decor, dimly lit and intimate with nice lighting features. Our server was friendly and helped us understand some of the menu options. I had the piri chicken benedict, which was very well prepared but honestly I rarely do chicken for breakfast but wanted to experience this spin on a Benedict. I will likely try a different entree next visit. My guest loved her friend fish and they have several tasty appetizers you can try. Parking was easy as they have an adjacent valet lot and several on street pay-by-app parking spaces. I'm told this place gets lively in the evenings and there's dancing upstairs so definitely worth the visit!",

The DJ played a mix of R&B and the food was delicious. \n\nParking is pretty scarce since the area is so popular. Be prepared to spend time getting a spot. The lighting is nightclub dark, love the decor, no dance floor. You don't have to dress up but you can and you won't feel out of place. \n\nI recommend the griot and pickliz (Haitian cuisine), collard green and crawfish dip and the hot honey shrimp. The hot honey shrimp is a small portion so if your hungry and you don't plan on ordering multiple things I wouldn't order it.\n\nThe only water they have is Aquafina, Fiji, and topo chico.\n\nDrinks are a good mix but I went with my reposado tequila gimlet just to be safe.\n\n20% gratuity is added to all orders. The staff is worth it. Very attentive with a great manager.",

The restaurant is dimly lit with music playing at a good level so conversation could be had. The staff was friendly and our server was amazing. The food and drink menus are tailored to make you want to order multiple times. We ordered the lamb eggrolls and janga dip. Both were excellent. The janga dip is their version of spinach dip but with collard greens and tons of crawfish. The mains we had the Red Stripe catch, which is their fish n chips. Beer batter catfish seasoned perfectly with garlic truffle yucca fries. Another diner had the curry goat and rice. The cocktails were on point as well. \n\nI recommend this restaurant 10/10 and will definitely be back. Great establishment and menus!!",

NOW the food!\nThe crispy beef empanadas were amazing it just melts in your mouth and the mojo rojo sauce was a great complement. Then the spice cheesy collard greens and crawfish dip both of these apps are a must order. \n\nI had the Haitian fried catfish with a bed of diri kole, the entire meal will ignite your palette with flavor, and the epis..stop it. The only down side to the night was that the fish was under cooked, which wasn't a big deal it happens, I was only upset that I had to wait for new one :(.\n\nNext, visit will be for dinner.",

I am not a big lamb person but those lamb egg rolls definitely hit the spot. The meat tasted fresh, no gaminess and was seasoned to perfection. The egg roll was nice and full and crispy on the outside. The sauce that comes with it is also a a 10. So, If you like philly steak egg rolls, please do yourself a favor and order this because this is the elevated version. For my drink, I had a sidecar and it was made perfectly. \n\nThe restaurant is beautiful but super dark and romantic. It would be a nice spot for a date, birthday dinner and even a girl's night out. I liked that you can go upstairs and it turns into a lounge situation so you can eat and party all in one. I liked to be in bed by 12, so this is my type of vibe. The service was a little slow, but attentive. The place was busy but the servers were doing their thing. I met one of the owners and he was such a vibe and engaged us in conversation about some of his ideas and how he planned to scale business. I would definitely come back and support this establishment. I have so many menu options I want to try!",

The Eggrolls stole the show for me, we ordered two of them and the sauce was even better. \n\nI really liked the music and the Dj! I'd recommend this place as a cure date night because the lights are low or for a good group of girl chat. You have a minimal of 90 minutes to sit and an automatic 20% is added to your check, but our server Maya was absolutely amazing and super attentive. \n\nI came on a Thursday and didn't have any problems finding parking.",

                "text": "I decided to visit this place with my friends on a Friday night. My party originally was 8 and it narrowed down to 5 people the day of the event. I made reservations on the last Friday of May with one of the hostess. I let all my friends know & confirmed the time for Friday June 2nd @ 9:30pm. The day before I received a call from the manager Kaila who you happens to have the same name as me telling me about the restaurant policies. After the phone call, she sent me the full breakdown of the dress code and bill split. Now, I asked on Yelp did they split the checks individually & two people stated yes. I did research for weeks figuring out about the parking, dress code and etc. \n\nBefore I get into my full event I did want to add that parking is street & valet parking. On the day I reserved, the hostess did confirm all of this and the parking was 20 dollars. The street parking is metered however by the time of my reservation the street was dark making me out to do valet parking. \n\nAmbiance/interior design. It was truly beautiful and indeed a masterpiece. It was dim light creating a nice grown & sexy vibe. The music wasn't too loud to where I couldn't hear the sound of my own voice as well. Which was a plus for me.\n\nExperience/Customer Service \nThis place does not seat you until majority of your party is present. Thankfully, the party that was attending all showed up at the same time. One of the young ladies at the front took my picture & told me Happy Birthday. Once seated, our server Kaila approached us & introduced herself. She asked about the party amount & I replied the 5 will complete this party. Her customer service was decent however there was time when she forgot to bring sauces & even dessert. When we asked about me receiving a complimentary birthday cake & her response was kinda sarcastic saying no & then recanting by saying just kidding. I didn't find it funny however I did receive a lemon tart complimentary cake. \n\nOnce it came time to pay she brings out one check. When asked about the bill being split she said it can only be split evenly with everyone. Confused &\ngetting annoyed because I am being told too many things, I did not like the response & she stated she would have to get the manager over to resolve the issue. Splitting evenly wouldn't be fair cuz one of my friends opted not to eat at all. The manager Jamal came over to rectify the situation & for the inconvenience we all got a glass of champagne. In my honest opinion the service could have been better & me and my party really did appreciate Jamal's excellent customer service skills. Lastly, this place like many others automatically takes out 20% gratuity no matter how good/ fair the service is. It's up to you if you wish to tip additionally. \n\nFood \nI got the beef empanadas & the jerk egg rolls which were packed with flavor. Since I am a tequila girl I got the patron margarita which was strong & it was no need for refills. A couple of my friends did not like their food choice because it lacked flavor. However I was satisfied with my appetizer orders. \n\nOverall experience score \nMy experience was overall okay & the interior is indeed a nice vibe however it's a little pricey if you wish to dine in on their foods and drinks. The drinks are strong & the two appetizers I tried was pretty good.",

                "text": "So I chose to celebrate my birthday at Rock Steady because from their Instagram and Yelp reviews, everyone seemed to say this was an amazing place for food and good vibes. This restaurant is located off Marietta St. in Atlanta, GA. \n\n\nI must say, the inside of the restaurants ambiance was very warm and intimate. Upon walking in, I checked in with the host so my party could be seated. Prior to making my reservation I asked for a booth and was informed there is no guarantee a booth could be provided due to if they need it for a bigger party size so it's what's available when your party arrives at the restaurant. That was fine. You only get 90 mins to dine and the time starts once you are seated. My guest and I were seating at a 4 top. \n\nThe lighting is very dim so you will need your phone to look at the menu/ your food. Our waiter was okay in regards to her customer service. She wasn't over the top but she wasn't that attentive as well. Prior to making my reservation I put in the notes, I would be celebrating my birthday. Prior to calling about my reservation a day beforehand dining at the restaurant, I was told I would receive a complimentary dessert and my server would know about it. However, I had to keep reminding my server it was my birthday and for her to bring out my complimentary birthday dessert. She was placing the check on the table for us to pay when again I had to remind her I never received my dessert. That's when she finally brought out a custard tart with berries a candle and some Prosecco. \n\nAll in all the food was a 7/10. I ordered the BBQ Jerk Grilled Chicken with fried sweet plantains, collard greens and Diri Kole ( Haitian rice + beans and rice). The jerk chicken was amazing! Perfectly grilled and the bbq sauce that came with the meal paired nicely with the chicken. However, the plantains and rice were just okay, not that flavorful. The collard greens were surprisingly sweet with a little kick. The sides were not that warm which is why I gave the food a 7/10 if the food was warmer and the sides were more flavorful, I could give more stars.\n\nThe drinks were delicious and did the trick. I ordered the ASAP Rock Steady (Canadian Whiskey with bold tiki flavors of pineapple and sorrel). This drink was warm and sweet which if you love brown you will love this cocktail. 8/10. They also have an open bar so if you don't see a cocktail of your choice, you can order whatever you would like.\n\nWhen it comes to closing out your check. The check is split down the middle so depending on the amount of people you came with, the check can not be split individually and they will only take the max of 3 credit/debit  cards for the entire bill. 20% gratuity is already added to your bill plus tax.  It would be nice if this information was listed on the website or was told prior to us ordering our meal so guests know what to expect because everyone is not comfortable splitting the check down the middle of they didn't order as much food and drinks as everyone at their table and mind you we were only a table of 3 so not being able to pay individually was a little odd. \n\nThere is street parking available on Marietta St. but it makes more sense to valet. Valet is $20. FYI. \n\nOne you have finished your meal, you can go upstairs where you will find VIP seating, a bar and a dj playing some good music. However, we went on a Friday night and went upstairs around 12pm and no one was really dancing. however, I've heard Thursday nights are better. \n\nThe restaurant was very warm and hot inside. When I asked one of the waiters if they were aware it was very warm in the restaurant, she advised she was aware and the temperature  had been that warm their entire shift. It had to be at least 78 degrees in there. I looked around and people were fanning themselves with the menus to cool themselves down.  However, when we went up stairs, we noticed how cool the temperature was and we realized all the cool air must have been going up stairs. SMH. \n\nOverall, the restaurant was decent. I didn't find it very comfortable or accommodating but it definitely had a cute decor. I would walk not run but it all depends on what your into.",
