        "text": "My friend is a vegan. \n\nDespite my paleolithic preferences, I pressed myself to find a spot that could accommodate our group's differing tastes without compromising on the excitement of discovery. (Not everyone is excited to learn about curry tofu.)\n\nThe Venn Diagram overlaps and Mushi Ni appears! It's one stall in this hole-in-the-wall food court hallway, communal picnic tables lining the wall opposite their humble stand. We sat and enthusiastically studied the menu. Their specialty...is the bao.\n\nI got a Com-Bao (a combo, y'all) which included one savory mushroom bao with a creamy garlic mayo that reminded me of a baby Philly cheesesteak and one cauliflower bang bang. \n\nCauliflower is having a true Anne Hathaway moment: straighten this teenager's hair and take off her glasses and suddenly everyone's all \"cauliflower, so cool!\" By playing with its variable texture, making it crispy and keeping it juicy, Mushi Ni has made an irresistible sandwich/taco of spicy cauliflower. This shit is next level addictive. Both were vegan.\n\nWe all got different baos. My boyfriend got an octo-bao with lime aioli and it might have been the best-prepared octopus I've ever had. I let go of my ethical complications with eating octopus and, for the octo-bao, I'd do it again. Also extraordinary was the lemongrass-marinated pork belly with duck confit and plum hoisin sauce. HELLO? IS THIS THING ON?\n\nIt's all delicious. The four of us had at least 14 baos between us. To diversify, I also went with a spring mix and thin-sliced ribeye bowl. Simple yet tasty, filling and a great value. Imagine living around the block and needing a snack while your partner needs a full-blown meal. \n\nAnd then there was the Tempura Oreos, the kind of snack that kills your ego and makes the bottom of your belly glow. One of the owners, Michael Le, was serving us himself, swiping our cards with an iPad, behind him a deep fryer. His kindness, humor and hospitality resulted in an extra tempura oreo. \n\nThey're local. They're organic. They're casual but not guilty or trashy, unique but accessible. What an exciting little spot. Go. I live 6 hours away and I'm mad about it.\n\nI want more baos, Michael.",

        "text": "Mushi Ni is one of the restaurants inside the Global Grub Collective. They specialize in Asian baos and bowls, while using the \"cleanest\" ingredients possible (local, organic, pesticide-free, etc). \n\nI usually opt for their small bowls, which come with your choice of grain (brown rice, noodles, quinoa) or greens, and protein. The bulgogi is great, but I often will go for the mighty veggie option to keep it healthy. The veggie relish they include on it is delicious! The tokyo fries are also yummy. \n\nFor the price, Mushi Ni is hard to beat. I also like there are lots of options here to go as healthy as you want, and it's quite vegan and vegetarian friendly.  Using quality local and organic ingredients is the cherry on top! I'm definitely a fan!",

        "text": "We wandered upon Mushi Ni while passing through Atlanta and I couldn't be happier that we found this place. My husband and I did the bao 6 pack, glass noodles, and pork buns. In the 6 pack bao we did 2 pork belly, beef bulgogi, tofu, duck confit and eggplant. When I tell you that pork belly bao was one of the best things I've eaten in a LONG time, I do not exaggerate. It was so crispy and juicy and just perfect. My next favorite was the eggplant. It rivaled the crispness of the pork belly and had incredible flavor! The pork buns were not what I expected, but still great. I wish I could have taken a picture of the glass noodles, but my husband inhaled them. I took a bite before he finished them off and I can confirm they are delicious! This place is definitely worth your while. Judging by the quality and flavor of our food, I'd say there isn't anything on the menu that would disappoint you.",

The rice bowl is a pretty healthy option and complemented the heavy richness of the duck confit fries. The brown rice in the bowl was too mushy for my taste.

I love getting their classic bowl with sweet potato glass noodles and broccoli/kale mix (this broccoli /kale mix is so delicious and flavorful I eat it first and I eat all of it... and there's a LOT), topped with either duck confit, cauliflower or their lobster hash. Their pork belly bao is one of my favorite things I've ever put in my mouth. Really... EVERYTHING they make is good. Order the whole menu. You won't regret a visit.",

Like, I think about them, I crave them, I am in a relationship with the frequent thought of their consumption--there's a new part of me now that can only be fulfilled by a Mushi Ni boa sampler and some crispy, piping hot sesame fries.  It's like I'm in love.  And you should be, too.  Believe me, it's so easy to enhance your life in this small but meaningful way.  \n\nThe bulgogi boa is my current favorite, a perfectly proportioned saucy and crisp little meat treat suspended inside a light boa cloud that steams delightful umami essence up into your thrilled little nostrils.  Everything about it bangs so hard, yet it is so soft and perfect.  The same could be said about all of their boas really.  The octopus and cauliflower are also favorites, but you should definitely get the sampler because they rotate through recipes and try new stuff all the time.  Go hungry and double your fun by getting some tasty glass noodles.\n\nCheck these guys out.  Mushi Ni is the real deal.  Everything is fresh and made on the spot, so make sure to tip well.",

The baos were some of the best I've had in Atlanta. \n\nI don't usually check out places on a whim but maybe I should more often because I'm so glad I found Mushi Ni.

        "text": "Yes! This place is the real deal. It is a food counter in the midst of a small global food court (not to be confused with the food court at the mall) with a few other delicious looking menus. There is a row of picnic tables to sit at, lending to the possibility of sharing a seat with somebody you don't know. But don't let your introvert tendencies prevent you from missing this gem, the food is worth it. The staff is also exceedingly kind and patient.\nI got the FilAM chicken as well as the bulgogi bao. Both were pretty amazing. Others in my group got the shrimp bao and were equally impressed. My side of Tokyo fries was the best batch of fries I've ever had. They are well-seasoned and served with an incredible Japanese mayo dipping sauce. My wife got the char siu bao side. Also delicious. My daughter had the veggie dumplings (think egg roll filling in a fried dumpling). Again, really tasty.\nOne recent reviewer mentioned a \"greasy mess\". Eh, maybe. I did not experience the same, but the fryer does factor prominently in the cooking of many of the dishes here, so if that is a big consideration for you, choose one of the other options in the same food court. For me, I'll eat the delicious food here and then choose an appropriate dinner.",

        "text": "Mushi Ni is tucked away in Suki Suki grub collective and is a fan favorite restaurant in East Atlanta Village. This grub collective concept is a shared flexible space that allows customers to try a wide variety of foods that are all in close proximity of each other. Each restaurant has very simple menus, but are held to a very high standard. Our destination today is known for its Baos, which are Chinese bread rolls stuffed with a assortment of meats and vegetables . Co-owners Michael and Chef Tanya Jimenez-Le, graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and prior chef at Gordon Ramsay`s two Michelin Star restaurant in New York, continue to provide great service and phenomenal dishes to their patrons. \nMeal started off great with a roti as an appetizer. Nicely breaded crispy shell made biting into it amazing. The Beef and  paired well with the sweet and mild sauce served on the side. \nEntree consisted of Chicken loganisa and Pork Belly Baos. The Baos were very fluffy but were offset by the crunchiness of the wonton noodles. The chicken and Pork was nicely seasoned and paired well with the fries. A side of spicy mayo added a nice kick to both the Baos and Fries. \nI was surprised at the end with Tempura fried double stuffed Oreos that laid in front of me. They were lightly breaded and served with Nutella and powdered sugar drizzled on top. I could not finish them as you can clearly see.That finished off the  nicely and I appreciate Michael for the kind gesture. Thank you again Michael and Chef Tanya for the wonderful meal and service! See you soon Mushi Ni!",

We had the chicken, tofu, and cauliflower baos they were all equally as flavorful!! The bowl was awesome the greens were fresh and the noodles had so much flavor. I was especially surprised by how much I enjoyed the tempura Oreos... I originally ordered these for my kids but I lovedddd them. My kids loved the fries and chicken baos.... they can be hard to please so we will definitely be ordering from here again. Overall awesome experience.",
