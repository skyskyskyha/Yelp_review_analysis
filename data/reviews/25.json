        "text": "Heard great things about this restaurant. The hubby and I decided to take the 30min drive and try it out. Let's say it did NOT disappoint.  The food was so flavorful. Our hostesses Lis was so accommodating.  We did not have a reservation, it's highly recommended. However she was able to seat us within a small wait time. If in the area OR not and up for a drive, give them a try. You won't be disappointed.  Oh and they have FREE parking, which is rare for that area. Oh one more thing the drinks!!! Man oh man.. on point... one and done on point and I can usually have 2-3 easily lol. \n\nSo I took a video of all the food we ordered after snapping this two? However I don't usually post here so don't know how to upload the video lol... or it could be the drink",

It was filled with soo many options to choose from plus pictures! \n\nNow let's get to the food! Oh my gosh it was delicious! The beef skewers had me wanting more. We also ordered the chicken skewers, crispy duck, curly corn, vegetables noodle, drinks & even dessert! And let's say there's barely any leftovers!\n\nEveryone was sooooo nice and they even brought out a birthday ice cream for me & sang the birthday song. Definitely come back. This place deserves the hype. I don't make reviews unless I was left with an impression & this one did it for me. Give it! I'll be back.",

Many of the dishes taste a little too similar, I wonder if they are supposed to be that way. Also, the creme brulee was terrible. The texture of the cream is way off, and the sugar was not torched correctly at all... I couldn't even eat the one bite, as the cream and sugar grains were both really bad in both taste and texture...",

Bali Crispy Duck - small portion and it was OK, have had better and expensive for what we got, Yellow Coconut Rice-good,  Green Crepe Roll dessert - was ok   \n \n\n\n***COST (OUT OF 4$) $$ for all we got it was reasonable cost, remember these are appetizer portions $10-$12, the Rijsttafel was $30 & the Sate Tasting was $32\n\n\n\n***DÉCOR: modern with curtains dividing dining area, booths, parking is very limited \n\n\n\n***SERVICE: friendly service, attentive and food came fast \n\n\n\n***RECOMMEND: HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place and would go back. wish they would open one up OTP",

The soup is so tasty and would be the perfect cure especially when sick. Yellow curry was delicious and the chicken had a nice smoky flavor. My friend ordered the curry fish and curly corn which she enjoyed and said was filling.\n\nThe interior is very nice. As soon as you walk in it makes an impression!

        "text": "Winning at WIN!! This restaurant exceeded all of my culinary expectations. If you have not been what are you really waiting for? This place is focused on Indonesian cuisine and they knock it out of the park! There are a few Indonesian spots in town and they are tasty, but this place is top notch! \n\nNow the location is tricky in that you could miss it and the parking garage is in the basement and the elevator may not be accessible after hours and you will have to walk outside to the deck, but who cares it's FREEE!!!\n\nNow the decor is very very minimalist , but service is superb! There was not an unhappy diner to be found! \n\nIf you are a fan of small and diverse plates they nail it!!!!!  The food is fresh, succulently seasoned , and perfectly executed. The price is very friendly and the cocktails are cocky baby! \n\nI enjoyed everything that touched my lips! My favs were the scallops, corn strips, and the soft shell crab dish.  The sambal was sooooo tasty as well as the spicy and sweet sauce accompaniments.",

        "text": "Such a lovely place. Lovely staff. My friend and I came here for late night tapas one night, and we were not disappointed. First of all, I cannot believe I have been driving up and down Piedmont and I have never noticed this restaurant, but the owner let me know that they had been here for years! Anyway, I'm so glad we found it randomly on OpenTable. \nFor the table, they give you a shrimp, crackers, and dipping sauce to start out with, and they offered us there a margarita of the day, which was a mango margarita, and it was five dollars. And it had a good amount of alcohol in it, which I really appreciated!\nOne thing I really appreciate it is that the menu has pictures! I didn't get to take a picture of it but the menu literally has a picture of every single dish and this is so important for you to set your expectations on your food and how you eat for the evening. When the food arrived, it looked exactly like the picture, and I was so happy about that. My friend and I got a variety of tapas to share. The prices are so cheap for the value received. We got this lamb satay, and we also got sides of fried rice, soft shell crab and a shrimp dish I cannot remember the name of. \nEverything was so flavorful, and different. I don't usually eat meat, and today I stepped out of my zone and had a lamb sauté, which I did not regret. It was juicy, tangy, and a little bit sweet and spicy. So so good. It's one of their most popular dishes. , which I really appreciate it. We also got visited by the general manager, and he gave us some of his suggestions on where to order and we did order some of those. We just had a lovely experience. \nI can't wait to come back here again, I've already told several friends about it. 10/10 experience",

        "text": "Win was really good & an excellent choice for dinner last night. My friend and I wanted to try several items so instead of getting a large entree we opted for several tapas aka small plates. While we were deciding on our selections I decided to order the iced lychee tea to drink. It was really good and not overly sweet. The server also brought us complementary shrimp chips with sweet & soir dipping sauce. The chip alone didn't have much flavor but paired with the sauce they were really good. For my tapas I ordered the corn fritters, crispy brussel sprouts, and the seafood skewers.\n\nFood:\nCorn fritters- really good\nCrispy brussels- I didn't realize they were going to have batter on them. I took most of the batter off & just ate the brussel. The flavor was good & paired well with the dipping sauce.\nSeafood Skewers- You get6 skewers for $12. They were really tasty and made with minced swordfish and shrimp. \n\nAmbiance: \n The ambiance was really nice. I loved the greenery in the bar area. I will definitely be returning to try some other items.",

Very nice but it took 45 minutes to get our drink and we put the drink order in with the food. By the time the drinks finally came we were done eating. We essentially had our drinks for dinner. But then the server was nowhere to be found. Mind you he had 3 tables including us. Yeah he needs to be retrained asap or they need some more staff.

        "text": "According to the menu, WIN stands for Wonderful Indonesia. But the General Manager told me it actually stands for Wonderful Indonesian Netherlands.\n\nToday was my second visit after being lucky enough to score a complimentary meal with some Instagram Influencer friends earlier this month. I was so absolutely impressed with the food and service that I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt I wanted this to be my next date night out with my beautiful bride. Feeding her good food is the key to a long-lasting marriage... so we jumped in the car on a Monday evening (for no particular reason) and headed down for a wonderful experience in Dutch-Indonesian cuisine.\n\n    [ THE EXPERIENCE ]\n\nFIRST, let me say the staff is incredibly accommodating. It seems that everyone from the server (Stephanie R) and kitchen staff to the general manager himself sees to it you are being looked after as if you are honored guests. They not only paid special attention to me and my dining companions on both my visits, but every other table was equally cared for in the same welcoming fashion. Even if the food had been mediocre (which it wasn't), I would come back simply to experience that level of care. Parking is limited in the front, but there is a free garage on the lower level just behind the restaurant which was a lovely surprise considering free is not normally in the description when parking in Atlanta proper.\n\nThe restaurant itself is nicely decorated with an upscaled casual feel. Not so upscaled that you would feel underdressed, but not so casual that nicer attire isn't warranted. Most of the tables feel more intimate towards the rear while the front gets a lot more natural light from the large glass windows. It was here I met yet another popular Instagram Influencer, enjoying her meal and doing her thang with a camera. \n\n     [ THE FOOD ]\n\nOn my first visit we were treated to a large assortment of menu items which included 3 different RAMENS (shrimp & tofu was my favorite), 3 different SATÉS (all delicious), Bali grilled pork BABY BACK RIBS, crispy whole RED SNAPPER, BALI CRISPY DUCK and practically every appetizer on the menu. Simply put, you can't go wrong here with any of the apps, but I wasn't a huge fan of the Red Snapper or Crispy Duck. Good, but not as flavorful as many of the other items.\n\nOn my second visit with my wife, we enjoyed the three appetizer sampler for $20. We chose:\nSP6 - BRUSSELS SPROUT TEMPURA (4.5 stars)\nSP2 - CRISPY CORN FRITTERS (4 stars)\nSP1 - VEGGIE EGG ROLLS  (3.75 stars)\n\nMy wife decided to get out of her comfort zone and try the PLANT-BASED RENDANG (4.5 stars) while I opted for the real thing, their world-famous BEEF RENDANG (5+ stars). Both entrées cost $14 and came with pickled vegetables, coconut soup and sautéed potatoes. The plant-based rendang is made with jackfruit, but looked so much like meat that my wife had difficultly wanting to bite it. However, once she did, it passed her taste & texture gage-reflex meter despite really looking AND shredding like meat. My Beef Rendang was soooo tender and absolutely delicious that I ate a little too fast, which left me wanting more!\n\n     [ FINAL THOUGHTS ]\n\nWe hadn't departed from the restaurant more than 5 minutes before my wife was posting on Facebook recommending WIN to some of her friends, which made me very happy. I truly HOPED she would enjoy it because she can be rather finicky with new things. After all, Bali cuisine is not in our typical restaurant rotation of flavors. We live quite a distance away, but plan on returning with even more friends as soon as possible. Everyone in our circle needs to experience what wonderful Indonesia really means! I hope those reading this review will come and have as equally a satisfying experience as we did... ENJOY!!!\n\n2022 / 114",

And the price tag is nice on your wallet. \n\nWe went on a Monday night and they had a decent crowd, a few larger parties and definitely short handed on service. But...the service we did receive was very good.  I ordered the Bali sunset and it was good and very strong.  We ordered the three meat option, pork, lamb and chicken. The lamb was by far my favorite and then the beef. The sauces are really good and the fried rice isn't one like you think. It's really very simple, yet very good with the sauces. Our bill was $65 for all this food and two drinks. This is definitely a repeat for us and one you should try. The portions are smaller but really fills you up. And don't let the simple decorations or the wait deter you from eating here. It's all very simple but full of f",

        "text": "Visited on a Saturday night with my fiancé for date night. He made reservations via their website for 8:30pm and specified date night as the occasion. When we were seated we had our own little semi private area separated by curtains and it was a very cozy. \nThe menu is extensive and we decided to order a few different appetizers to share. We ordered the Small Plates Tasting with vegetable spring rolls, curly corn,  land brussel sprouts tempura. We also ordered rica rica shrimp. Along with water we each ordered a Bali sunset, but I got mine with tequila instead of vodka. \nWe were brought shrimp cakes which looked like rice cakes. Our drinks came shortly after. Along with looking pretty they tasted delicious. You could taste the liquor, but it was subtle not overpowering. \nThe shrimp cakes were ok. They didn't have much flavor but they had a light flavor at the same time. \nThe food was brought out and the plating presentation was beautiful. We couldn't wait to dig in. Other than the brussel sprout tempura having a bit too much batter, everything was delicious and they each had their own dipping sauce. The curly corn had great flavor. The spring rolls were crispy. The shrimp was tasty with a slight spice to it. \nHe still wanted something else so he ordered the gohu tuna carpaccio which came out pretty quickly with beautiful presentation. This was also delicious and probably my favorite thing that we had. \nOverall it was a great experience and definitely recommend giving them a try.",

        "text": "This is kind of a late review but it had to be written anyway because I love this place. This trip came about because of a canceled trip to Bali but our desire to still try Indonesian food. \n\nWhen you walk in, the decor is so inviting and makes you feel like you stepped into a different country. It's a mix of a lot of greenery and Indonesian art and design. We were originally sat in the back area next to a family. I appreciated the server discreetly asking if we'd like another table because the baby with the family started screaming. \n\nAfter we moved we looked over the menu and wanted to try everything so we ordered a bunch of food. There was nothing I didn't like...that's it. Okay, I didn't eat as much of the corn fritters but that's only because it was a little heavier than I wanted at the time. Everything was perfectly executed and felt like they thought of every detail to make the bite visually appealing and tasty. And a bonus is you can eat so many things at a tapas restaurant and leave with a decent bill.\n\nI can't wait to go back.",

        "text": "Perhaps our expectation is too high or we are just not familiar with Indonesian cuisine. We drove from Milton to try Rijsttafel for the first time in our lives. (We spent two weeks in Amsterdam a couple of years ago but never managed to experience Rijsttafel which was a huge regret.) We ordered the small plates of sea tasting, one chicken soup, one mushroom soup, and one Rijsttafel. We each had a cocktail and we had the dessert crepe rolls. The presentation of everything was pretty nice. The restaurant interior decor was good too. The service was attentive, although not anticipatory. The drinks were good but not fantastic. The scallops were pretty good, the roasted fish was VERY tough, the crab tempura was fine but didn't taste too much like crab. The Rijsttafel had a good variety but nothing fancy. The best part of the whole night was definitely the dessert. The crepe rolls are made in house, as is the sorbet. This was delicious. The price is very good but the overall food is mediocre. I guess my biggest complaint is that more than half of the menu is fried food. I didn't think Indonesian had so much fried food but admittedly, I'm not familiar.",

I always see this place on my drive but also heard good things about it on TikTok so my friend and I decided to try it. \n\nService: I booked us a table but when we got there apparently they didn't have anything for me. I even showed host the reservation on my phone but he said oh it's OK I'll seat you anyways. We got seated quickly but the server we had was very slow. I had I ask for water refills several times, to the point where I had to ask other servers because our server was no where to be found. When I came to checks he justjust brought it over and we actually wanted dessert. When we asked he actually discouraged us from getting dessert because it was busy. We said that's ok we would wait but in the end we didn't get it because we felt like he just didn't want us to get any.\n\nFood: tbh food was not good at all. The only thing I enjoyed were the Rica Rica Shrimp Al Ajillo. We also got the Chicken & Egg Pillows which tasted like a samosa to me. For dinner I got the Yellow Chicken Curry Rice Plate which was honestly just confusing to me taste wise. It was like teriyaki chicken with Thai yellow curry. It wasn't spicy either so I had to add some hot sauce to add more flavor. My friend got the fried chicken dish which just tasted like regular fried chicken. \n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed with the food and the service didn't help. Unfortunately, would not recommend.",

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the staff/management was so nice!! \n\nIt wasn't super busy when I went, and we were able to get a nice private booth. I had the rijsttafel which was a great way to try a bit of their whole menu. I can't remember what each thing was, but my favorites were the beef rendang and the fish curry. They definitely packed each plate because I had tons of leftovers to take home!\n\nAlthough the rijsttafel in Amsterdam was much better, Win is a pretty great and cheap option for Indonesian food in the city.",

        "text": "Came last night for my second time. First try was great maybe because I sat at bar so service was better and it was slower during the day. But last night was horrible. Restaurant lacks consistency of serving fresh food and sincere service. Waitresses rushing my order, and still serving me cold food. I sent back chicken satay bc there was no glaze on it and cold, scallops were cold and rubbery so I sent back and they brought back SAME DISH telling me \"the chef said it's the sauce\" I've literally been here before the condescending service was insulting. I kept food to keep my cool but left no tip just bartender got one bc the only good thing that night. So if you want 50/50 chance of getting cold rubbery scallops and a rushed meal then take a chance. I recommend Sri Thai instead! Will never be back",

I would highly recommend all the small plates of the sea if you're looking for something fresh. As far as entrees, you can't go wrong with any of their signature dishes. The  one dish that stood out to me most was their Chicken Curry Plate. It's a great spot to bring your friends, especially at the beautifully decorated bar, or makes for a great date night spot. Giving this review 3 starts being that the main entrées were just lukewarm in my opinion, but all the appetizers/small plates were piping hot.",

        "text": "Been seeing great reviews for this place so I dropped by Monday night for dinner. The place was pretty empty so we were seated and served really quickly. It's looks a bit fancy but is actually a bit more casual than it first seems, so don't worry.\n\nWhen seated, they provide these shrimp (?) puffs with a mild-spicy dipping sauce. A great free appetizer and they even offered to refill it when we finished it (which we took). We ordered the Small Plate Tasting, which lets you pick three small plates for $20. We got the pork wontons, vegetable spring rolls, and the chicken and egg pillows, per the server's recommendations. All were great, especially the pillows - such a unique flavor and a great dipping sauce (wasn't sure what was in it .. onions and some spice?). We also got lamb sate skewers (comes with 6). It comes with a sweet dipping sauce, kind of like a teriyaki sauce. The skewers are a bit small and a little too burnt, but pretty decent. Usually lamb has a weird aftertaste, which I didn't get from these so that was good.\n\nOverall - I rate WIN very highly. The food was pretty good and decently priced. Part of why I rate this so highly is because there are so many other menu items that I want to come back for (and there's so much variety!) - so this place definitely pulled me in. Our host/server was also super friendly - he checked up on us often, offered shrimp puff refills, and offered some great recommendations. Definitely recommend coming here for a nice and flavorful meal!\n\n**Parking might be rough. The parking lot up front is pretty small. There may be a parking lot in the back, but not sure.",
