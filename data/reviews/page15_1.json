There are so many great things in the area and New Realm fits right in. \n\nWe walked along the BeltLine on a Saturday and stopped in for a flight of beer and to enjoy the sunshine. \n\nPros:\n- Good beer (several choices, everyone can find something they like)\n- Location (BeltLine adjacent)\n- Price (flights and tasters were reasonable)\n\nCons:\n- Crowds (so very busy, it was hard to find seating)\n- Service (quite slow, even when at the bar)\n- Beer line (the first line at the entrance is confusing, it's unclear what to do)\n\nOverall, had a positive experience and would definitely return if in the area.",

They also have appetizers ranging from $10-$16, so it's a gear spot to beers & light apps. \n\nI suggest their Mac and Cheese ($11), it's a must have you you love it cheesy. It comes baked with a beautiful crust . \n\nWe did not like their Asian-Style loaded fries ($10)- think crispy seasoned fries.  Not goey and overloaded at all plus the pork on them was dry. Their wings ($14) are just your basic bar wings. \n\nOverall they have a great range of beers from blondes , to sours (try the Berries & Bloom), to stouts and IPA's. Beers range from $6-$7.",

        "text": "Since its opening, New Realm has become a dependable staple on my rotation of local restaurants. \n\nThe location is conveniently off the Beltline, so you can either walk right up or use their Valet in their huge parking lot located of Sommerset/Ralph McGill. \n\nPart of the reason I love New Realm is their ambiance- the indoor eating space is very large and comfortable, but they have several areas for patio eating that allow for great people watching, live music, and a more casual vibe. I typically bring my dog, so opt for the picnic table area that is very very very dog friendly in addition to having cornhole.\n\nThey have a rotating tap and only certain beers can be poured and specific bars at New Realm (they have two outdoor bars, a growler bar, and an upstairs bar). So either know exactly where to go for what you want, or be flexible with their options. Hoptropolis is one of my go-tos with a very citrus-froward hoppy taste. I will warn you that it does sneak up on you and may feel it more than you expect! My husband errs towards more German style beers and likes the \"Munich Dunkel\" as his typical order. They currently have a \"Oaxaca Choca\" Imperial Mexican Chocolate Stout and wow is it delicious. Most of the bartenders/servers can guide you towards an option if you are overwhelmed.\n\nI also LOVE the food here...most of the time I'm wanting to go to New Realm for some of their Asian Loaded fries more than wanting a beer. I swear these fries are addictive with their crispy pork,siracha, and miso mayo. The pretzel is also a great appetizer for sharing. If I am feeling like eating something more, I typically get the New Realm Burger (I like the classics, what can I say). While I have my go-to order, they are wonderful about rotating the menu and trying new things. \n\nIf you are looking for a casual place to meet up with friends, people watch, or just even eat some delicious fries, check out New Realm.",

Their tap list wasn't very exciting, nothing too exotic or unique. I'm not sure what kind of clientele they are going for but I got the vibe that their tap list was geared more towards the mainstream beer drinkers and not the beer nerds. I got an IPA that was ok but not anything to write home about. I would love to check it out again so that I can write a more reflective review. Its on my to-do list next time I'm in ATL!",

Our food came out in a timely manner, despite how busy they were so we definitely appreciated that, and our server was very attentive and friendly.

The flavors were great and loved the au jus sauce to dip the tacos into. To be honest I had my doubts that this would be good haha but new realm does a great job with their job and menu. The corn was flavorful as well not too salty and grilled well. The beans were great too. \n\nI also had some of their Buffalo wings. They nice and crispy not too spicy somewhat salty. The crisp was great, soggy wings just don't do it for me.. the wings came out hot and fresh.\n\nI was surprised they didn't have the NFL network, would have liked to have watched TNF but it was 2 0-3 teams playing and playoff baseball was on. They have been closing at 10 pm anyways so not the most ideal spot for 8 pm games. I would definitely recommend the new birria tacos they have on the menu if you're here!",

I had the she-crab soup with herb oil and it was so good unfortunately it didn't make it to a photo because it was gone very quickly. The \"B-ATL grilled cheese\" was eh okay, I wasn't a huge fan of the apple butter and the bread on the sandwich. There was great entertainment, a guy playing guitar which we tipped he was pretty great. \n\nThe cornhole was so much fun. Our party enjoyed the game and the weather was so perfect. \n\nGreat tourist place to go if you aren't a local. We are from Virginia Beach, VA.",

        "text": "My friends and I checked out New Realm after walking down the Beltline from Ponce City Market. The place is relatively new and has an amazing outdoor area, which I'm assuming gets very packed when the weather is nicer. \n\nWe were seated right away, but had to wait a long while for a server to arrive. When our server finally arrived, he took our beer orders and disappeared. We didn't see him again so we had to ask another employee to bring us water. Our waiter brought our drinks to our table and we didn't see him again until it was time for us to pay. I normally wouldn't have been bothered by the lack of attention but there weren't many other tables there.\n\nDespite the service issues, I really enjoyed the brewery. I got a flight with four beers. There isn't a set price for the flights. Instead, each of the beers have a designated price for their 4 ounce tasters and you can build your own flight with up to 6 tasters. There were very interesting beers the day I visited, the most notable of which were the Oatmeal Stout, Oaxaca Stour, and Beluga Rose. I would suggest getting a flight to try a few different beers! \n\nOverall, the beer was good and New Realm is such a cool place to hang out, but I was very disappointed by the service.",

Really enjoyed the Belga.\nMenu prices were pretty good not too bad. So to sum everything up. Everything was great BUT our server made us have a unpleasant experience. He took forever just to take our order. And check on us.\nAnd bring our to go box. My husband sat and waited for him to get the payment and I went to get the car from valet and still had to wait for him to come out to our car.

It was a Monday night, so it was more quiet when we went, but honestly nice to be able to enjoy indoor seating without too many crowds/germs.

        "text": "New Realm is solid, and is clearly very popular as every time I go there or walk by it is bumping. Here are my opinions about the beer, the food, and the overall experience. \n\nBeer: Just ok. There are a ton of other breweries in Atlanta and in terms of how much I like their beer, New Realm is near the bottom of the list. Their beer is not *bad*, but does not stand out in the field. \n\nFood: Pretty good. I had the grass fed burger and it was above average. Juicy, good bun. Had it with the salad which was also pretty good for a brewpub, where I feel like salads are usually meh at best. \n\nOverall experience: Before COVID, this place was always SUPER crowded in the evenings, probably because it's huge and right on the Beltline. To be honest it's not my vibe since I like to hear the people I'm there with, but it's fine. I think that right now during COVID times, they at least were only doing outdoor seating the last time I went there, which is good, but the tables are unfortunately quite close together, so it didn't feel *that* safe. The whole outdoor area, despite being quite spacious, does feel quite crammed, so I don't think I'll be going again until things feel safer. \n\nOverall, if I'm on the Beltline and I'm craving a good burger, I might stop in. The beer isn't particularly outstanding and the seating arrangements are not as spaced out as they probably should be.",

        "text": "This place is cool. Was not expecting what this place was going to be like but it was a pleasant surprise for a brewery! The building and interior a really very nice. We went here to watch a football game on Saturday and when we arrived we were told that the TVs were up on the roof. Okay... It was pretty chilly out but they said they were going to turn on the heaters and it would warm up quick.\n\nIt is a great view from the rooftop. It was mostly closed in and the heaters, wow did they warm it up up there. They had to shut most of them off after a while.\n\nThe beer was great, the food was delicious and the service was great as well. We followed Jeremy up as he was opening up upstairs. He served us our beers and we ordered some food. He turned off the music and changed every TV to the game we wanted to watch. Perfect!!\n\nThe wings, pretty much just hot wings. They were good. My daughter ordered the Spicy Korean Pork Cheek Buns, DELICIOUS! Then for lunch my wife ordered the hamburger (Radegast) I was going to order but I did not get as much help eating the wings as I expected so she split her burger with me. Damn that was a good burger!!\n\nIf I was a local, I know I would frequent this place. :) I look forward to the opportunity to come and eat and drink again!",

Although I enjoyed my meal the service was extremely slow and had to request our server a couple times. Could've been a one off due to the high volume at that time.  \nThe second was during the week, a Wednesday evening to be exact,  Ordered wings, pizza, and beer.  Food was what you'd expect from a brewery,  Chillies comes to mind.  They only serve their beer so don't get too fancy.  The roof top overlooking the Beltline is a nice option.  Have a drink, people watch, have more drinks.  Valet is the best option If I you are going to one of the establishments as they will validate and offset the cost difference from self park so that's a no braineR.  Check it out.",

We made our own flight of about 6 different beers (all delicious), ordered a margarita pizza and some French fries. Everything tasted amazing! The server was kind and attentive.

        "text": "I came to New Realm Brewing for an event that was held here and my experience was awesome! The New Realm Brewery is located in a great location overlooking the Beltline and it also has a great view of the city of Atlanta. The food, service and beers were spot on! I enjoyed the mac and cheese, charcuterie, sliders, meatballs (yum!!!) and the bacon grilled cheese, and let me not forget the desserts they offered! The bartenders and the servers were very friendly and professional and actually took their time explaining the beers and food to me. This place will be my new go-to hangout spot for hanging outdoors while sipping the variety of beers. \n\nFor the beers I tried the Euphonia, The Commissioner, and the Perun and all of them were great! However, the Perun was my favorite. Below I have listed the three beers I tasted and their descriptions:\n\n* The Euphonia is a Pilsner - German 5% ABV. Hop bursted with noble & new-school hop varieties. Crisp, dry, with vibrant hop aroma.\n\n* The Commissioner is a Blond Ale - Belgian Blond 5% ABV. This easy-drinking Belgian-influenced blond ale was the first beer brewed to commission their package lines. Light malt character, fruitiness & clove from the Belgian yeast. Very crisp and refreshing.\n\n* Perun is a Pale Ale - American 5.5% ABV. A homage to the style that created craft beer. Citrus and pine, with a touch of caramel maltiness. \n\n\nI will definitely return here and enjoy the beers again and their food! On top of New Realm, they are dog friendly! Cheers!",

He didn't have high expectations for the beer based on previous remarks from the craft beer community, however I went in with no expectations and hoped for the best. Sadly the beer lacked punch, flavor and overall a limited variety. I tend to be attracted to sour beers and dark stouts and their coffee porter was the closest I was going to get to my preferred flavor palette. \n\nAs for the food, I ordered the Tucker Farms Green salad with an add on of the Blackened Shrimp.  ($19) My husband ordered the Gluten Free Red Quinoa with Beer Can Pulled Chicken. ($20) Both were tasty, but Uber small portions. The Tucker salad was supposed to be accompanied by heirloom tomatoes, kalamata olive, shishito peppers and mozzarella cheese but I could barely find them. \n\nWould probably only revisit if in the area ..",

They always have a diverse crowd in the evenings, but I'm not a beer drinker so I never thought to stop by. My coworkers and I decided to go for lunch one day and I'm glad we did! \n\nWe were greeted by the hostess and immediately seated. I ordered a kale Caesar salad, usually a romaine and kale salad, but I asked for all kale. I also added the beer can pulled chicken. \n\nMy salad came out perfectly! I wasn't sure how I'd like pulled chicken on a Caesar salad but it was pretty good. I'm picky when it comes to croutons when ordering salads because they are typically stale, but these were fresh and flavorful! Overall, the salad was fresh, the caesar dressing was good, and the pulled chicken was flavorful. My only feedback would to be have an option for grilled chicken on the menu. \n\nOne of my coworkers had the Radegast Burger, he said it's one of the best burgers he's had! There were 5 of us and we all enjoyed our lunch and agreed we would go back.\n\nSo if you aren't a beer drinker, don't count New Realm out. They have great food and great service.",

        "text": "New Realm brokered an excellent spot on the Eastside Beltline and has marketed it's location better than any other establishment on the trail with the exception of Ponce City Market.\n\nI'm all in with the layout of the establishment. It promotes social interaction and utilization of the outdoor space very well. I almost forget it's a brewery after a while especially given the fact they sell food. And it's very apparent someone invested in the facility a great deal. The metal works all over the place, comfy furniture and decor. It's definitely a chill spot. Would love to get a hold of the general contractor that organized the construction of the place.\n\nHOWEVER! \nMy first pass at New Realm isn't 5*. In particular, the brews aren't my favorites. Not to be a beer snob, I just didn't find one with mainstay power. And to be clear, the brews aren't disgusting by any means, but I'm not sure I'll have NR pours in my rotation. Therefore, since NR is a brewery that sells beer (hello), my enjoyment of it is predicated on the beer. While the facility is damn nice, it lacks the (frequent) return factor for me without a beer I can write home about.",

The food was okay but I was very disappointed that they didn't have a full bar to serve things like wine, long islands, etc. I ended up ordering a cranberry and vodka which tasted like merely juice. The dinner menu seemed very limited as well. Nonetheless, I think it's a pretty good restaurant and I probably will return on maybe a weeknight when there's less going on.",

The food was a bit less great the times past. I had the turkey sandwich and it was better the first time.  The cocktails were not as good as the beer, we had the tropical dream!  It was delicious.  We even got a six pack to take home!",

My only feedback is that it gets BUSY, seriously no joke, it's gets crowded and especially with COVID, it's a little uncomfortable. There is plenty of outdoor seating but I recommend getting there before rush periods!",

This was well-before the lunch crowd and the restaurant was not that busy.  The server was then snarky later on when the check was presented and my dining parter and I were deciding how to pay.  The server said in a not so friendly way \"yeah, I'm really busy so you need to decide...\"\n\nDisappointing that you can't get a sip of a beer to taste before purchasing.  Unless you want to pay $4.00 or so for a few ounces.\n\nThe beer I got was good....but turned out it was one of those tiny beers at a regular beer price because of the alcohol content.  Right.\n\nNot very customer friendly or customer-focused.\n\nFound it over-priced in general.\n\nAnd you have to pay to park there.\n\nI don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.",
