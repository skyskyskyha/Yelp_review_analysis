Our waitress was so sweet and gave us two cannolis for dessert because we were celebrating a birthday. Both cannolis were great and they give you a little menu to pick whatever toppings you'd like on them. I'll definitely be back!",

        "text": "Recently, we went to Grana for brunch and it was absolutely amazing!!! \n\nWe tried some new brunch items as well as some classic Grana specialties. Our favorite brunch item had to be the Crostini (with whipped ricotta, truffle honey, sesame seeds), but the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich (with a whole burrata ball might I add!!!!) came in for a close second. We had to get our classic favorites, the Roni pizza and the Meatball Tasting, of course. We tried quite a few drinks, as well. All of them were very delicious, but surprisingly, our favorite  was a chai latte martini that our server suggested.\n\nOur service was also amazing! From the hosts to our server, everyone was friendly and helpful.\n\nWe can't wait to go back to Grana again. Only thing that we hope for next time is that it will be warm and we can utilized their rooftop!",

        "text": "I am aware that my take may be uncommon, yet my party had an absolutely poor experience here. The only positive I can speak to is the food which was delicious and that the valet service was convenient. Our service was terrible. We were a party of 3 at dinner on a Tuesday, thus the restaurant wasn't its busiest. After making a small show of wanting to work our table from the waitress who first greeted us, our waiter made a couple of inappropriate comments, was shamefully absent (38 minutes between requesting the check and returning to collect payment) and even sat blatantly watching the football game while we waited for him - or anyone - to pass by to check in. As other tables were seated, served, and left, it then became clearer that maybe our waiter hadn't immediately put in our order because of how much time passed between our service but tables with different servers seemed to be better attended. It's unfortunate because just a few weeks ago I had a great experience at the Ashford location. This is a complete turn off and I cannot recommend or say that I'd revisit.",

This place is mostly a nice pizzeria so we went for some garlic bread and Cesar salad instead. The garlic bread was more like a white pizza which gave us a sample of what the pizza might be like. We loved the mozzarella on top and the dough had a nice fluffiness to it. The Cesar salad was decent and enough for two small side salads. The server was polite and came to check on us a few times.",

        "text": "Grana is, has been, and will be, the best pasta experience in Atlanta. In 2019 I worked under Chef Pascarella at the White Bull in Decatur and saw the magic he worked on farm-to-table cuisine, so was thrilled to hear he was creating a restaurant centered around his traditional expertise-- Italian. \n\nGrana combines Pascarella's culinary acumen with his passion for Italian food. It's a step up from White Bull in its decor and scale, with open air pizza kitchens, lofted ceilings, and portraits of early 20th century Sicily as far as the eye can see. I wouldn't necessarily recommend the pizza since you can get similar artisan pizzas at Sapori de Napoli in Decatur, Fritti in Inman Park, etc, but the pasta really is one-of-a-kind at Grana. My personal favorite is the short rib, but anything that catches your eye will be amazing. \n\nGrana has become an Atlanta staple for me and my family, and I can't wait to check out what else Chef Pat will bring to Atlanta in future years.",

My friends each got a cocktail and I got the mocktail. I think everyone liked their drinks, the mocktail was a bit tart though, so just keep that in mind.\nFor food, one friend got the rigatoni which is supposed to be a crowd favorite and he really liked it. I got gnocchi and truffle pizza with meatballs to share with another friend and the fourth friend got the potato pizza. I tried a slice of the potato pizza; I liked both pizzas and the gnocchi.\nTo finish the meal off, we each did a build your own cannoli. I got chocolate dipped with cow's milk ricotta (filling) with chocolate chips on top. I'm not even a huge cannoli person but it was really good.\nThe inside is cute but I think the ambiance would have been a tiny bit better with dimmer lighting. I hate dark restaurants, but a slight dimming of the lights can change the vibe significantly. Our server was really good. It was everyone's first time there and he explained the whole menu and answered any questions without getting annoyed (you know those servers).\nI liked everything we ordered! If I lived in Atlanta, I'd probably be a regular here. If I'm in town again, I'll seek this place out again for sure!",

The waitress that served us was very friendly and didn't mind sharing the \"ins and outs\" of the menu since it was our first time there. \n\nThey are \"famous\" for their meatball recipes and boy how they did not disappoint there. I'd highly recommend trying the Meatball Flight appetizer where you can get a tasting of each one. The burrata appetizer was very tasty as well and did a great job feeding the table. Also, the pizzas were phenomenal. I personally ordered the Chicken Parmesan Pane and it was unremarkable. The chicken was greatly overcooked and the slice of bread that the cutlets set atop off was far too dense and unappetizing.",

But they quickly checked to see if they could accommodate us, a party of 9, which seemed unlikely. The manager was able to squeeze us in, which was greatly appreciated since this location was closer for us. The manager and staff went above and beyond to get us seated and taken care of, so grateful that they were so gracious and hospitable! And the food was delicious, love the pizza!

We wish we were able to eat the meatballs we made, but they take time to set, so they served us some in-house ones. The Mommys (beef meatballs) were delicious!\n\nWe also got the garlic bread, brussel sprouts (caramelized and delicious!), ricotta crostini, and truffle pizza were my favorites of the night. I got the espresso martini -- they make them right here! My friend hyped up the build-your-own cannoli, so I got one with cow's milk ricotta (you have a choice of cow or sheep!), chocolate chips, chopped pistachios, and candied pecans. Yum!\n\nParking: free valet, just tip them!",

We were seated right away on the main floor (there is an upstairs) after valeting. The decor is nice and I loved the high ceiling and overall ambiance.\n\nWe started with the meatball flight, which was 6 meatballs. None were that spectacular even they claim they have the \"best balls\" in Atlanta. Ha! The entrees are shareable so we got three pastas, the squid ink, the rigatoni, and the cappelletti. The squid ink needed more flavor as it was a bit bland. The rigatoni was good, and the cappelletti was my favorite. The sauce was great and went well with the crostini we got. The crostini had sesame seeds, which was a unique blend that worked well.",

Everything we ordered was completely cleared, and we didn't think we were that hungry! \n\nOur total bill was $130 including a 20% tip and the bartender was amazing! \n\nI recommend making a reservation as we ending up sitting at the bar but food was served fast and fresh!

Do not miss the garlic bread, it's a classic here for a reason. Do yourself a favor and get the rocket power cocktail because it was as strong as it was delicious. The drunk uncle pizza, has the gummiest vodka sauce and had us literally licking our plates. While the New Yorker pizza had a cheese pull to die for, it was quite alright and nothing too great ( a good regular classic). The rigatoni was pretty flavorful but again just usual. The tiramisu was on the pricy end but if you're feeling it, treat yourself cause it was YUMMMYYYY (idk about $11 yummy but still tasty). The canoli however, SOOOO WORTH THE PRICE. it's huge and costs between $5-7 based on how many toppings you add. SOOOOO FILLING AND SOOOOOO WORTH IT",

The pizzas also weren't piping hot which could mean they weren't freshly made. Nevertheless it didn't affect the taste which is the most important part.

You can't help but stare at the lighting fixtures, the bar, and the decor on the walls. The first two things we ate were the Crispy Potatoes and Caesar Salad. Great way to start off your meal. Keep in mind, they serve \"family style\", so the portions are pretty large. The next dish we tried was the flight of meatballs, so delicious. My favorite was the meatball topped with currant mostarda. Refreshing and savory at the same time - I loved it. For our \"main course\" we shared the Cavatelli with ricotta salada. The pasta was cooked wonderfully and the sauce was excellent. To top off our dinner, we did the build your own cannolis! Super yummy and a great way to end the evening. I highly recommend visiting Grana!",

I was very worried about having to wait in line for lunch, but decided to take a chance. Glad we did, the valet let us park right up front and there was no line. Little hidden gem! \n\nThe staff was incredibly helpful with getting grandma around and found us the perfect table! \n\nHad the food been great then I would've given 5 stars. However, the food was only good. They have extremely limited options on the menu, especially for a pescatarian, kids and grandma. The pizza was good, but hard. We also had a pasta dish and a salad. We went there for the pizza, but grandma couldn't really eat it. \n\nBut, lovely location, ambiance and staff! Would recommend.",

We went for their Appertivo hour (happy hour) which has a few of their pizzas in smaller than usual size for cheaper (12$) and selected appetizers for 10$. Our favorite was the veal meatballs and ricotta and preaches appetizers. The place is great and the food amazing for the\nValue u get. I would\nRecommend trying the spot for a good alternative to the already amazing selection in Atl. One less star as the hostess at the front stand (skinny lady) was very distracted and more interested in talking to her peers. Our server was great, attentive and food came by quick.",

There are fans, too, so that helped with the humidity.\n\nShort Rib Sandwich- This was really good and unique. Don't think I've had a sandwich like this elsewhere. Wasn't a fan of the potatoes though as they were kinda crumbly and hard to eat.\n\nRoni Pizza- Definitely shareable. There are 6 slices. I like the subtle sweetness from the honey. It's also on the cheesier side if that sways you either way. Overall it was good, but I personally prefer the pizza from Varuni Napoli.",

        "text": "Reservations: I would recommend these, we were able to book through open table the day of and were seated immediately for. a Tuesday night. The restaurant did not seem too crowded, so walking in may not have had a lot of wait either. I bet the weekends are very busy though. \n\nParking: Though valet is complimentary, you should always tip, so I'll say that the parking is 10-15 dollars for about 2 hours. If not, there's paid street parking on the side of nearby establishments. I read some other reviews about the Sprouts parking lot, you could give this a chance too. \n\nAppetizers: We started off sharing the whipped ricotta crostini. This was a good and light appetizer of whipped ricotta atop a hefty slice of bread cut into two pieces (perfect for sharing), with some honey and roasted sesame seeds. The sesame added a new layer of taste and I would definitely try this combination at home since I love ricotta toast.\n\nEntrees: \n1. We ordered the potato pizza, which came with pistachios, honey, onions and goat cheese. This was served quickly. The pizza itself is quite thin; but with the toppings and size, I think it's a perfect size to share between two people with another entree added to the mix. The combination of ingredients definitely worked and provided a unique flavor that I wouldn't normally recreate at home while making pizza. I will likely order this again. \n\n2. we also got the cappelletti minus the prosciutto. This was such an interesting dish. The pasta, almost ravioli like, came filled with a cheese mixture, and served in a buttery sauce. I think the sauce was literally butter. It was a bit too much, and as a sauce girl, I was slightly disappointed it wasn't just some sort of cream based/tomato based sauce that you could dip the pasta or pizza crust in. There was a good portion size of pasta being served and with the fried sage, it was quite delicious. I don't think I'd order this again though. \n\nDesserts: We got our build your own cannoli, which was pretty delicious. However, the cannoli was room temperature. I know this sounds weird, but every cannoli I've had has a cooler filling of ricotta which somehow elevates the taste. That being said, I  would probably just get cannolis from somewhere else if I wanted it (make the drive down to the Antico's gelato and bakery shop and get a cannoli there). \n\nDrinks: We ordered some sort of bee drink. It was good, I don't remember much of what it was like, but very lemony and sweets. Probably won't order again. They also have a mocktail with 0 proof alcohol I believe, this is awesome! It's priced about the same as the other cocktails. \n\nService: Fast, efficient. Nothing to note. \n\nOverall, Grana was a great experience. I will be back but will not order the same things that I ordered this time. They have a good menu with vegetarian options.",

He was very sweet and attentive, my friend got pasta and I got pizza, we enjoyed the food very much and our drinks were very good! I just forgot the name but it was both wine and I believe tequila in it? Also I highly recommend ending your meal with a make-your-own cannoli, you can choose up to 4 toppings!
