        "text": "First of all my breakfast was absolutely delicious and my waiter was welcoming fun and friendly.  I enjoyed the music and the general informal fun ambience.  I had the chicken and waffles and loved it. The chicken was juicy and crispy and it had buttermilk and herbs. In the marinade . My waiter told me thyme is the special ingredient. The coffee was great. \nIt is a popular location, because of being across from the Georgia aquarium. I would recommend if you don't like crowds to go as early as you can. I went at about 730 I think and it was not too crowded, but there was a line when I was leaving\n\nMy only complaint--I wished my waiter had asked if I wanted refills on the coffee during my meal. When I finally did ask for a refill when he came with the bill, he asked if I'd like the coffee to go. I felt a subtle pressure to leave at that point, but since he had not asked, if I wanted a refil during my meal, and I didn't really want to hike around town holding a coffee cup, I asked if it would be OK if I stayed and drank the coffee, and he said yes.\nSo that is the only caveat, that the place is so popular that you can't really linger over your breakfast without feeling a subtle pressure that you have overstayed. As long as you know that though, it's a fun place, friendly staff and the food is great.",

        "text": "So I'm not usually a breakfast girly -- BUT, ABC was amazing. We were told by one of my boyfriend's coworkers that this was a need to stop place during our trip to ATL. When we arrived we were told the wait was about an hour... we probably waited somewhere near 30 minutes or so which was a nice surprise especially since we were starving and fresh out of the airport. \n\nOur server was friendly and prompt. Their menu is available via QR code which I absolutely love. Who needs paper menus anymore, I mean really. \n\nThey're known for the best fried chicken and waffles in ATL and man were they good. Both the boyfriend and I got modified versions. Mine was the Georgia Peach which is basically chicken and waffles but with peach cobbler thrown on top. It was divine. I would eat that 100 times over again.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is clean and has a bit of a retro vibe inside. We enjoyed the retro vibes amidst the hustle and bustle of their uber busy restaurant.\n\nOne thing that I didn't particularly enjoy was that all of their cold drinks are bottled. So if you want a refill you'll have to just buy another (over priced) bottle. For reference, they sell the tiny bottles of Simply juices for $5 a piece. Any other breakfast spot has OJ and apple juice for $3-4 and it's refillable.",

With great music playing and a well decorated atmosphere. \n\nIt was the food though that set this place apart. You could take the great service and the well decorated and themed setting, but it wouldn't change the fact the food was absolutely top tier. \n\nYou can't go wrong with the chicken and waffles and I don't know who thought up the P Buiscut, but give them a plaque or trophy up on the wall. \n\nHighly recommend making an excuse to visit!",

When figuring out where to go, I happened to see \"join the wait-list\" on yelp. We joined the 30 minute wait and took an Uber to the restaurant. When we got there, we were greeted with a mimosa truck and dj. Inside, the line was long and the music was loud. We were seated within 5 minutes. The hostess and waitress were very nice. \n\nWhen you arrive, you'll scan a QR code to look at the menu, though several dishes aren't on it. They recommend you look at their IG for inspiration. \n\nI ordered the cinnamon roll first, which was delicious. I took it to go, but it's definitely better fresh. \n\nThen, from recommendation, I ordered the p- biscuit with cheese and bacon. It was smothered in gravy, which was delicious but a bit overwhelming. My coworkers ordered the chicken and waffles with the peach cobbler topping. I had a bite and immediately regretted my decision. Though mine was the right kind of savory, I wished I had ordered both sweet and savory. It was all so delicious, though. \n\nIt is a bit pricey, but it's a must-try.",

        "text": "I decided to check out the Atlanta Breakfast Club at the recommendation of a friend. I walked in around 1pm on a Monday, and the restaurant was definitely winding down. If you don't mind eating breakfast food between 1pm-2pm, you will be able to avoid the wait! I had to wait a few minutes for a table to be cleared, but the restaurant was definitely starting to clear out when I left around 1:45pm. The ambiance is like a casual diner without any frills.\n\nI decided to get the peach cobbler french toast ($17.95) since I did not want to chance the chicken being dry for the chicken and waffles. I also got a side order of eggs ($4) and unintentionally ordered water ($4). Overall, the french toast was solid, and I finished the whole thing. I would love to see more peaches and shortbread on the dish because they were so good and added moisture and flavor to the french toast. \n\nEbonee was a great waitress! She explained the specials, did multiple check-backs, and did not make me feel rushed with the check. The only thing was that I wish she told me that the water would be \"bottled\" water. If tap water is not served/ good to drink, then I would have rather ordered juice if I had to pay for a beverage than bottled water. I enjoyed my experience here and would return for the chicken and waffles the next time I'm in Atlanta!",

He gave tons of recommendations on what to eat at ABC and also where to visit in Atlanta. Southern hospitality at its finest! \n\nWe ordered the cinnamon roll, shrimp & grits, and peach cobbler chicken and waffles. The cinnamon roll was nice and warm - they have a limited stock in the mornings. It was my boyfriend's first time trying shrimp and grits and he loved it! It was packed with flavor. I also enjoyed the peach cobbler chicken and waffles. The chicken was super juicy inside! I liked the cobbler topping as well, but it did start getting a little too sweet towards the end of the meal. Overall it was a great place to stop by for our first meal in Atlanta!",

Title: \"A Breakfast Experience Not To Be Missed in Atlanta!\"\n\nFrom the moment I stepped into the Atlanta Breakfast Club, I knew I was in for a treat. The vibrant atmosphere, combined with the tantalizing aroma of breakfast delights, set the stage for an exceptional dining experience.\n\nThe menu, a delightful array of classic and innovative breakfast dishes, left me spoilt for choice. I opted for their famous Peach Cobbler French Toast, and it was nothing short of a culinary masterpiece. The toast was perfectly crisp, topped with just the right amount of sweetness from the peach cobbler, creating a symphony of flavors in every bite.\n\nWhat truly sets the Atlanta Breakfast Club apart, however, is their impeccable service. The staff was attentive, friendly, and genuinely seemed to care about making our dining experience memorable. They were quick to offer recommendations and ensured our coffee cups were never empty.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is also worth mentioning. It's a perfect blend of cozy and chic, making it an ideal spot for both casual breakfasts and special occasions.\n\nIn conclusion, the Atlanta Breakfast Club is a gem in the heart of the city. Whether you're a local or just passing through, this place is a must-visit for anyone looking to indulge in a breakfast experience that's truly exceptional. Five stars all the way!",

However, they did have a DJ that was playing hip-hop in R&B music outside, which did half the time pass. I came here with a party of seven girls, we are all visiting.\n\nFirst off, I must say that the chicken and waffles were bomb. The peach cobbler was amazing as well, though I do not think that I can eat the whole thing by myself given the sweetness. I think the smartest thing to do is to get a savory dish, and then split the peach cobbler between the table.\n\nService was 10/10. \n\nBeware, they do ask if you would like to add on things to your meal, which ends up increasing the price of the meal by a great amount.\n\nPro tip : bring your own water bottle, because the water is not free. I repeat the WATER IS NOT FREE!!",

        "text": "Okay let's just start off by saying if you want to find parking it's going to be a little tough in this neighborhood because the aquarium is right in front of this restaurant. I would suggest you park at the aquarium for 20 bucks eat at this restaurant and then walk it off at the aquarium! Because these plates are full of yumminess! At one point I even said, \"heart attack on a plate\" I have never seen so much gravy and crispy bacon and eggs the way I like it over easy with yummy biscuits. Now mind you I am not a breast gal. I like dark meat all day long. But the way this server Janise described this meal I had to get it. It was a little loud to hear what it was called so I had to focus on reading her lips to actually know what was in it. Service was quick which is usually not a good sign but this food came and filled up the plate with all of the southern hospitality it had to offer. My server said they marinate the chicken for 24 hours. I am now an official breast meat eater, but only at this place . They have this truck outside that's blasting really good tunes that serve the drinks. I got my BFF and I two passion fruit mimosas after we ordered. They put them in coffee cups so you can take them into the restaurant. The price $14 each. Cha ching it was a nice light buzz while we ate and talked. Knowing that I wasn't going to drive afterwards that's why I suggested going to the aquarium or some other downtown event. I guess this is the happening place to go. I agree.",

Their hot sauce is mouth-watering. I wanted to snag a bottle of it. \nThe music was another favorite part. They made me pull out Shazam so I could capture the playlist. It wasn't so loud that we had to raise our voices but it definitely played a part in our conversations. It felt like a place you could hang with your cousins and be happy.

Be sure to check the wait list before you go and put your name on it. Saturday morning around 9:30 there was over an hour wait. It's a small little spot with excellent food and fast service.\n\nWe went with the recommendations of our server, and we were not disappointed. The shrimp gravy and biscuits should be on every menu, so delicious, and I think even better than sausage gravy. The chicken and waffles were elevated with peach cobbler topping and fresh fruit. We also added bacon because everything is better with bacon.\n\nIt is a bit pricey for breakfast, and they will charge you for all the extras, like bacon and fruit. An orange juice will run you almost $6. But it was definitely worth it. For true Southern comfort food and warm hospitality, this is definitely a spot to check out.",

I checked yelp & ABC's menu resonated with us.\n\nWe headed there this morning and were instantly greeted with a friendly host and seated promptly.\n\nYou are given instructions to check the menu on the QR code. This was an easy process and we quickly decided what we wanted to eat. \n\nI chose the peach cobbler French toast. 10/10  it was absolutely delicious. Very generous portions. I will be dreaming of this dish.\n\nMy husband chose the southern Benedict. 10/10  when asked if he has any comments about his choice, he said pure perfection.\n\nThey do only offer bottled drinks for water and fountain drinks from my understanding. Their bottled water comes in sustainable packaging but is rather expensive at $4/bottle. I ordered hot tea and was given multiple tea options.\n\nOur waitress was so sweet, prompt & caring.\n\nI would 100% recommend ABC!",

I rather prefer cream cheese frosting if I eat a cinnamon roll at all. \nAll drinks come in bottles except for tea and black coffee, no latte, mocha or anything fancy as far as coffee goes. \n\nTheir biscuits are good, light, flaky and not dry at all, even better with some honey. \n\nThe breakfast bowl was okay, the grits were good. Just enough to be filling. \n\nOur server disappeared for a while, another server put in our order for oatmeal.\n\nThe yogurt and granola wasn't too bad, the granola looked pulverized more than I was expecting. The fruit was on the bottom. I was expecting berries, but melon, cantaloupe and pineapple at all.\n\nThe chicken sausage and the Turkey bacon were both nicely grilled and tasted good. \n\nThe oatmeal looks good, rather skimpy on the berries though, more is extra, of course. It tastes some comforting. It's well balanced with the sweet mcinnamon and sugar.",

        "text": "Coming to Georgia, I was excited to try the well recommended chicken and waffles, and peach cobbler from the Atlanta Breakfast Club. Walking in at around 12pm on a weekday, there was a table available for 3, so there was no wait. We ordered the Georgia Peach (which is a chicken and waffles sandwich, with peach cobbler on top), Seafood Gumbo, and Sweet Tea. The chicken and the gumbo tasted fine, but the sweet tea and peach cobbler on top was crazy sweet! Not sure if this is normal, but it was an experience trying their sweet tea because it tasted like syrup. Good thing I bought my own water to cleanse my palate because you would have had to pay for bottled water. They do not service tap water. \nAdditionally, we really did not get much service. The waiter came to take our order, brought us food, and then the bill. There was no checking in as to how we were doing throughout the meal, and he didn't even give us a spoon for the gumbo. He did not give me space when paying the bill and tipping either. My friend saw him looking at the machine as I was putting in a custom tip. I've never had this happen before as servers usually walk away or turn away when customers pay...  We kind of just wanted to leave as soon as we finished eating.",

You can choose either grits or potatoes; I chose grits and I'm greedy so I wanted the peach cobbler french toast as well. Make sure you order half an order because it is so much food. The peach cobbler french toast was good but not amazing nothing stuck out, no overwhelming flavor of nutmeg or anything like that. The fried lobster was fried perfectly it was still soft and buttery. The shrimp gravy had a really smooth taste to it with big shrimp.  Overall everything was really really good.",

The patio had some heat lamps and there were a few benches available. Once we were seated, service was quick and informative. The food arrived very shortly after we ordered which was impressive. The peach cobbler French toast had a delicious sauce and I enjoyed the shortbread crumbles. However, the dish was quite sweet and I could barely finish the second half of the dish as the sweetness was so overpowering. I wish there was a savory element to balance it out.

The service of the ambience were very well done.\n\nThe problem I had was the excessive price. Most things were almost $20 and the water was five dollars. I have only had to pay for water outside of the US and the amount of food that receives was not proportional to the price stated. I expected so much more in quantity, but the quality was amazing. It more felt like fine dining portions, then a breakfast diner portion, if that makes sense. The service was amazing as I said before and the staff is very quick and attentive.\n\nI can see how parking can be rough, but they have extra limited parking in the back.",

There was a lot of flexibility with the ordering to allow for customization - e.g., swap potatoes for grits, etc.  The one issue was the potatoes, though tasty, were overly salty and I love salt!",

ABC is conveniently located right near the aquarium and Coca Cola factory touristy area though so 10000% make sure to make a reservation or plan ahead before coming because the lines are brutal otherwise. Also fair warning that they charge you $8 for water with your meal, so if you want something to drink with your meal you might as well try out the sweet tea/orange juice instead.",

        "text": "My partner and I were lucky to come in without a wait around the holidays when everyone must have left the city, but the restaurant was still buzzing and boisterous inside with a mix of travelers and locals. We were heading to the airport right after and aimed to not have leftovers, which seems difficult with how many of the neighboring tables left with containers! Just a heads up that they only serve bottled water with a charge here and not tap water, which our server clarified and we were able to turn down without issue. \n\nOur server was friendly and offered options to customize our orders, but we were already set to order their most popular items. My partner got the chicken and waffles with really well battered and seasoned chicken that he almost didn't want to share with me (I still got a bit to confirm how good it was!). I got a half order of the peach cobbler french toast, which was just delicious with crunchy cobbler crumbles and a good balance of peaches and syrup that made it not too sweet. The half order was already a pretty hefty portion, and of course my partner had to help me finish it too - very glad they have the option of half orders. We also got a side of fried green tomatoes for the heck of it. Probably the least value out of what we ordered, but just wanted to try the dish while we were visiting. The other two dishes absolutely deserved their reputation, and best of all, we were able to clean it all up with no leftovers!",
