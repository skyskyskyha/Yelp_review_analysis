        "text": "Met a friend here for Friday lunch. My past visits have been to enjoy their brunch. Unfortunately, the valet wasn't open. So we had to find street parking in the residential neighborhood. It wasn't too bad and the walk was short. I suggest you make a reservation. It wasn't too busy to be a beautiful sunny day. We sat inside. Our waitress, Kaitlyn, was the best! She had great recommendations and had a very personalable spirit that was delightful. The burger & fries was good. The fries weren't too special. He enjoyed his salmon with sacatosh. We both got dessert to go (cheese cake and key lime pie). My cheese had a very light custard and graham cracker crust.",

        "text": "So I picked this spot from the Yelp reviews, mind you I'm not from here. Went alone and sat at the bar because only reservations but like I said it was just me so cool. Bar host was Ray, very personable but definitely forgetful when it got busy. They should have someone else helping when it starts to pick up. Ray did recommend the Chilaquiles which did not disappoint but it could have been better if it was actually hot. The waiter brought it out and was like \"be careful the plate is hot\" and once he left I touched it and it was indeed not hot nor was the food. I devoured it but it could've been better is all I'm saying. And to no fault of there own don't get your hopes up to day drink, at least not till 11am. My fault I should've know but the drinks sounded good from what I read. Bottom line. Would I go back definitely, just make a reservation and go after 11am and I'm sure it's a hoot. \n\nHonorable mentions - the biscuits they brought out before the food. Amazing, I never thought I would like the strawberry flavored one but was pleasantly surprised.",

We'd made a reservation and opted to sit outside on the patio even though the table was almost completely bathed in the sun. Also, I was fortunate enough to snag one of the parking spots in the adjacent lot which was a huge bonus. We both had the sandwich/soup/salad combo which was a great deal. I had the chicken/corn/coconut soup which was excellent, the ceasar salad which was decent, and the brisket sandwich, the most tender meat and excellent flavors. Service was great as well. Will definitely be returning for lunch or dinner again.",

The smoked salmon flatbread it was delicious all the flavors that was on there was just so Good! My house made Organic Vodka Bloody Mary was the Best. I really enjoyed the food and drinks at this restaurant if you're ever in Atlanta and you're in the area it is a must check out.

Although it is still super cute and the service is great the food has really taken a turn downhill. We started with a meat and cheese plate which was just fine and we had the grilled artichoke which was mushy and tasted like olive oil with no seasoning unfortunately we sent it back. I had the steak and Fries which was tasty enough and my wife had the salmon which tasted like elevated cafeteria food. We both also had the \"chicken tortilla soup\" which tasted like room temperature but I did baby food. So sad to have this experience here.",

They always switch out what type of biscuits they are serving. I went one time in 2017 and they had fruity pebble biscuits. I really wish they would bring those back! I've been back so many times since then asking for those specific biscuits but they don't seem to have them. The food is delicious though. I always get the omelette with the grits and I absolutely love my food! I would recommend making a reservation for the weekend brunch because it does get very busy. The parking can be kind of tricky. There is street parking and a few parking spots available. Overall, this is a great place to come with family for celebrations. I normally celebrate birthdays or special occasions here. The vibe is flexible, you can come dressy or slightly casual and either way is fine!",

The special of the day was sea bass with turnip greens and squash. Very delicious and well prepared and presented. \n\nI pinched several deserts from my companions. The key lime pie was very good. The taste appeared to be deliberately understated, which worked well. The bread pudding was okay. I'm a New Orleans girl and bread pudding is on the list of dishes we are kinda snobby about. I also tried the praline cheese cake, which was good. My fav was the key lime pie. Not to be missed. \n\nWe were a large group and our server Rachel did a great job with getting all orders right and all food out at the same time... hot. She was very sweet in her response to my complaint. Which is why I am struggling with rating. \n\nI am disabled, temporarily, but nonetheless limited. This place has ONE handicap parking spot in an area with very limited parking. I ended up asking Wells Fargo if I could park in their lot. One handicap spot is just not right. Had I not been attending a work team meal, I would have left. \n\nTrying not to be irritated, but I am. The scarcity of handicap parking is atrocious and should be addressed by the local merchants. \n\nFor this reason, I will not return. Guess I've determined the rating. A shame because the food is great and Rachel was awesome.",

My friend and I got the mahi mahi fish sandwich. It was honestly just okay. We both had a glass of their sparking rosé, which was refreshing and sweet. We also had the grilled pound cake--waaaaayyy too sweet for me. I ended up with a headache after a few bites. I think it was just too sugary. But it may work for others--it just didn't do it for me. \n\nThey also have on the lunch menu that they add a 20% gratuity automatically to ensure a livable wage for their servers. Now, I make sure to tip and tip well for any service, but my thought is that, shouldn't the restaurant just pay the servers a livable wage? I have mixed feelings about that because I definitely think people should be paid livable wage and much of that responsibility should come from the establishment. At any rate, our server was kind and knowledgeable about the menu options.",

Although it was her birthday, we all ate like it was all our birthdays! \n\nThe most convenient way to park is through valet next to the restaurant then walk a few steps. We had dinner reservations for 8pm on a Sunday. It was a holiday weekend and the restaurant wasn't busy. We were seated right away.\n\nMurphy's has an upscale but cozy vibe. Plenty of seating including outdoor. They offer a nice variety of salads, proteins (especially seafood), and dessert. \n\nI had the following:\nWhite Chocolate Latte with Soy milk $5.50\nFlash Fried Calamari $12\nSteamed Main Mussels $13\nEnchanted Springs Trout $17\nKey Lime Pie $8\nTollhouse Pie $8\n\nI started with the latte because I was sleepy and wow, it was amazing! Probably one of the best lattes I've ever had. Sweet yet bold. Now, the food. Everything was absolutely delicious from start to finish! I don't think we had any leftovers, except maybe dessert. Everything had so much flavor! My favorite dish has to be the trout. Loved the crunchy skin! And the pies. The pies were absolutely delightful! I recommend getting all the dessert!\n\nWe were so full and satisfied after our meal. Service was great, too. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Prices were reasonable for the flavor and portion. Will definitely return!",

        "text": "There's a reason Murphy's has been in business for as long as they have. Actually, there are several reasons. A dear friend and I met for brunch yesterday (we made a booking last week, please do this before you go) and the experience was wonderful! We were seated outside (per our request) at a lovely corner table. John was our server and he was great! He greeted us upon arrival and immediately took care of our drinks ... a cappuccino for my friend, americano for me. The coffees come with a homemade almond biscotti, what a lovely touch, and it is delicious!\n\nFor food we split a half order of the french toast and I had the eggs t murphy (eggs benedict) with the cheese grits. Oh and we also had a sampling of the bread/muffin basket so we were destined to float away on a cloud of carbs! The bread basket is complimentary but you have to request it.\n\nEverything was delicious and the portions are generous. My only issue was when we asked the lady who brought our food for an extra plate for the french toast (since we were splitting it) she never brought it. Actually, John came by to check on us and ended up getting an extra plate. They were busy and probably understaffed but that was a little ridiculous! Our food was definitely cooled down by the time we were able to eat.\n\nRecommendations... make a booking in advance, get a coffee of your choice, ask for the muffin basket, and whatever food you get, select cheese grits as your side! Murphy's specializes in consistency and an enjoyable experience.",

        "text": "Had an ok experience here.\nAttended a company dinner at this restaurant. We had a reservation so we were seated right away. It's very small so I can imagine on a busy weekend day, it can get very packed.\nThey only offer valet parking but it's only $2 which is pretty convenient when there is no street parking.\n\nOur server was pretty nice . We first ordered a round of appetizers. Basically tried everything they had. My favorites were the avocado toast and the crab cake. Some of the others said the artichoke was good but needed more seasoning but they loved the goat cheese and charcuterie board ! \n\nWe also ordered drinks. I tried the bloom Orande mocktail. I asked the server if it was sweet and she said it was but when I received it , it was not. Very refreshing however. \n\nIt took awhile after we finished out appetizers for our waitress I come back and place our dinner order which was a little frustrating because I know a lot of restaurants tend to hold food so that everyone can eat at the same time so I knew it would take a long to get our food\n\nI ordered the burger and asked for it to be well done. Some of my other colleagues ordered the same thing.\n\nWhen I received my burger it was not well done at all but blood was coming out of it. My colleague also asked for hers to be well done and hers was the same. She sent her burger back and basically asked for it to be burnt and when it came back , it still was not well done.\n\nUnsure what that was about. However someone had the brisket and the meatloaf and said it was amazing .\n\nI would come back and try something else , however my first experience wasn't that great.",

It had been about a year since I've last come which has only been for brunch so my friends and I thought it was about time we'd pay Murphy's another visit. The met around noon and when I arrived there wasn't a wait but they'll only seat you if the entire party is there so I had to wait a little before my friends came. The place was pretty packed; inside and the covered patio. The service was great. Food was good; especially the avocado toast. Oh my goodness. And I loved the tea presentation. Different flavors to choose from plus your own kettle! Next time, I definitely want to come for dinner and try some of their wines. The list looks bananas!",

        "text": "The food was really good. I do feel like the server made a stereo typical comment about needing hot sauce which I did not ask for, and she possibly/obviously tried to switch up her dialect to sound more \"down\" or \"relatable\" also.... Please don't do that. We're not ghetto aliens, we're business woman, speak normally please as we, I, do to you. I hate that. It's never necessary, yet common, smh, so I deducted 1star for that, but that aside, I really like this place. They were organized with the social distancing and provided masks free if you need to be inside for any reason such as dining in or the restroom and they show you where the bathroom is versus just pointing to it, which is nice even though the restaurant isn't that big, it could be easily found. They also check temperatures upon entry. I thought that was good service. \n\nWe sat outside to be safe and it was a beautiful warm evening. They stopped taking the last guests at 9pm to close at 10pm on a Friday I guess, and we were the last to arrive and leave. I ordered the Market special of the Day: Halibut over mash and Sauteed Garlic Spinach with lobster cream sauce. It was delicious. Didn't seem like 7oz of fish to me. It was a small portion and I was still hungry after. I love halibut but it's light like cod and most fish, bare that in mind if you want to be full. Even with the flash fried calamari appetizer, also very light, I was not full. The fish needed more seasoning, and I requested the halibut pan seared to be as crunchy as possible, it wasn't. Still good though. My friend had the market salmon over green peas with side of mash. I enjoyed the wine. I was going to order the Sauvignon blanc like I normally do but decided to go with the vouvray inside and I liked it. I ordered two glasses, my friend ordered some Atlanta drink which she said was weak. I do want to try a Chardonnay they have named Simonnet-Febvre because it reminded me of my name. I highly recommend this place for brunch and dinner. Just know we spent $70 each and I left hungry.",

However, the last couple times I was there for lunch the quality of the food had fallen. This past week I went for lunch again hoping for a better experience and it was the WORST lunch and shockingly poor quality. I ordered the Chicken Thai salad and the very thinly sliced chicken was full of grizzle and fat. I told our server that the chicken was inedible and he told me that the Chicken is sliced from a deli chicken. That would explain the rubber texture and flavor. I am still shocked that Murphys is trying to get away with serving a horrible and inexcusable piece of something, NOT chicken. For the amount of money you are charging for a salad, please serve a real piece of chicken.\nI will not be returning. Murphy's you may want to cut corners, but you lost a customer for life!",

        "text": "I love this area!  Came here with another couple to get warm and grab breakfast after a cold race.  Cute place with a wine bottle shop and bar.  Service was very good.  \n\nI don't typically drink coffee, in fact never, but I was dying for something to warm me so I tried a white chocolate latte.  Wow!  That was so good that I gulped it down in about 3 minutes or less.  It came with a small sweet biscotti as well, which was an added bonus.  I tried my honey's bloody mary which was also very good.  \n\nThe place was decently packed, and has a nice vibe.  We were lucky to get a table quickly, because there was definitely a decent wait on the way out.  You can valet, which in this area is always a nice option.  It's $2 to valet, and well worth it.\n\nThey bring out some little cornbread-type muffins.  They had a colorful rainbow of crispies on top, and I thought that was just something sweet without flavor.  On tasting it, I realized it was actually like eating fruit loops...yuck!  Thankfully we had also ordered the toast basket.  It came with white and some multigrain toasts.  They were accompanied with some sweet butter, apple cinnamon jelly and strawberry jam.  The toppings were great, because the bread was pretty standard.\n\nFor my meal, I decided on the Santa Fe burrito with home fries aka fried potatoes.  I didn't care for the burrito.  I thought the wrap was very pasty and just didn't do anything for the inside eggs/cheese/veggies.  The home fries were pretty good, especially with the addition of ketchup.  I did get to try my honey's caramelized banana with homemade whip cream.  Now that was devine!\n\nI am still dreaming of that banana, and definitely need to find a way back to the Highlands to try more things.",

I enjoyed the brisket which was flavorful and textured in all of the most perfect ways. The market dish was cooked to perfection. The portions were hearty but not overbearing \n\nPrice: For the quality, I'd say that this restaurant found a perfect price point. The brisket was about $24 which, for the portion and taste was worth it! If you're balling on a budget which I definitely am, this may feel a little pricy, but for such a good meal I'd splurge. \n\nAtmosphere: trendy, casual, timeless. We sat on the porch which was gorgeous; however, the lights near us were not on and the heater near us was broken, so we actually had a hard time seeing anything. We did bring it to the staffs attention and they were so friendly and kind but did not reconcile (although it was very busy so I do understand.)\n\nParking: honestly I would likely valet if I go back, but there is usually street parking, too. Sometimes it's easier to find than other times but never too far of a walk! \n\nCOVID protocol: temperature was checked at the door, the tables were spaced out accordingly. Staff all wear masks",

        "text": "Well, FINALLY got to eat here!  We had been in this area at the beginning of December for a cancelled race during the most snow Atlanta has seen in years, and Murphy's wasn't opened.  We had our chance New Years Day after our 5k, so I made sure we got over here.\n\nIt's not far from Atlanta Botanical Gardens (where we drove from), and sits right in the Highlands.  Parking can be tough, very tough.  We ended up opting for Valet, since we had 4 ppl and it was 22 degrees.\n\nThis place was happenin' ... very busy.  Thankfully we got seated right away.  Our waiter was on top of everything, and excellent at his job.  We all ordered coffee, I had a latte and my honey had a white chocolate latte.  My coffee was good but hers was insanely amazing!!!  It needed no creamer or sugar, and was delicious, WAY better than the white mocha latte I had at Press and Grind next door.  This one was a must get!  Both our coffees came with biscotti, and that was a perfect addition!\n\nI ordered a Bloody Mary to celebrate finishing a cold race, and it was perfectly made.  Very spicy and a huge celery stalk added.  My honey enjoyed it as well.  I'd recommend it.  We were also given a small muffin and biscuit basket.  It only had 3 in it, but the fruity pebble muffin I had was really good, especially combined with the sweet butter.  I also ordered a toast basket, which came with cinnamon apple jelly and grape jam.  Perfect for the hungry runner!  The toast was evenly browned.\n\nI had a hard time deciding on my meal bc everything looked good.  I opted for the French toast.  Oh man, so glad I did!  It was moist, powdered and came with a decent side of maple syrup.  Also, it had a dollop of whipped cream and a caramelized banana on the side.  Holy heck, that banana was good!  I could eat this every morning for breakfast!\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable breakfast.  Will certainly want to come back here again for brunch.",

It's a corner building that they made a good use of and has a nice flow to it. \n\n+   Food here is American and known for brunch.  I used to visit Murphy's more often before my friends in ViHi moved out of state.  I used to have brunches but on this trip, I opted to try their Grilled Skirt Steak Chopped Salad.  My friend also decided to try a salad as well.  We both enjoyed our salads.  Mine was not over dressed and the steak was cooked to order.   It was perfect for lunch!\n\n+    Service was prompt and attentive.  Our server, Jessie was prompt and attentive throughout the meal.\n\n=   Price was reasonable to slightly high.    \n\n-   Parking was very tight!  Their lot has a handful and street.  Their valet was not offered at lunch.     \n\nIt was a nice revisit but it'll probably be a while for me to drive across town.",

        "text": "I mainly went here because the reviews looked great. I always try my best to not leave bad reviews but this restaurant surely ruined my day. I apologize for such a long review but I believe that people should know about my experience with them. \n\nFirst of all, I had to ask for the drinks after 20 minutes of ordering it because the bartender forgot about it. When I my friend got his mimosa, it had a small hair in it, I saw it right away when the server brought it to us and requested him to change it. Also, they are supposed to bring out complimentary bread at the beginning and we saw all the tables getting it right when they were being seated but we didn't get ours until all the other food arrived an hour later \n\nSecond problem was that we asked for scrambled eggs but they served us over medium, my best friend then had to wait for the food for a while. When they finally got back with the food, this time there was no gravy. But the first time we got the food, there was gravy. I clearly asked the server to give us all non pork items because I can't eat pork, he did say they have chicken sausage gravy. But we didn't get to taste it even though it should come with our dish. \n\nThird and the biggest issue was that I found bacon bits in my plate. When I called the server, he said he would go talk to the chef or the manager. He came back to serve other tables but didn't bother to let me know anything. I called him again and showed him the bacon bits, he even agreed they were bacon but then told me that chef didn't put any bacon here and it might be onions. I was really angry but trying to keep it together because I know what bacon bits look like and my friend and the server verified it, then he said the manager said to take it off of the check. But just taking the dish off of my check isn't fixing my problem. I was really guilty for accidentally eating a little bit because I am Muslim and I grew up knowing that God will never forgive me if I eat pork. I expected the manager to come and apologize at least. I know I didn't eat it intentionally but I seriously just wanted to throw up. We still ended up paying $48 for our breakfast. He only took off my dish from the check but I really expected a sorry or a discount from my overall check because I couldn't eat more than half of my food, the service was really poor and they honestly didn't seem to care at all.",
