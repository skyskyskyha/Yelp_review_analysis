        "text": "Wow oh wow. Aziza exceeded my expectations in so many ways - do yourself a favor and book a table here if you haven't already!\n\nCame here for dinner with a large group a few Fridays ago (we booked the res about a week in advance). We got a patio table, which I was initially apprehensive about (given that it was barely 30 degrees that night), but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the outdoor patio is covered, heated, AND adorned with the cutest hanging lamps. Easily one of the most tasteful outdoor patios I've seen at a restaurant, with more than sufficient heating!\n\nI chose the Al Fresco cocktail, which tasted divine - tart, refreshing, well balanced. Our table split several apps, all of which were excellent: hummus #2, octopus (YUM), cauliflower, roasted brussels and mushrooms, just to name a few. I got the roasted duck for my entree, which was easily one of the best duck courses I've had in my life. Perfectly cooked, so much flavor, and I absolutely loved the variety of elements and textures in the dish (ranging from a soft pâté to a light crispy filo dough topping). Sometimes in life, you're presented with a dish that goes above and beyond in its execution and creativity factor - this dish was certainly an example of just that!\n\nTo conclude, we split three different desserts - all of which were fantastic in taste and presentation. I think you can't go wrong with anything on their menu, to be honest. I also believe their menu changes quite frequently.\n\nService was good (but not necessarily outstanding) throughout our meal. This restaurant is good for large groups, small groups, dates, solo meals - you name it! Also, they validate your parking if you park in the garage closest to the restaurant.\n\nAziza might be one of my new favorite spots in the area. Can't wait to come back soon!",

        "text": "I've dined at Aziza three times over the last year or so and had a great experience each time. They serve modern Israeli cuisine in family style sharing dishes. I've always enjoyed both the food and the service when I come to Aziza. \n\nThe first time I visited, I was with a larger group and we ordered the full experience, the m25 and a few other dishes. I'd recommend trying the full experience if you have a large enough group (ask your server how many they think it serves). This way you get to try some of most of their dishes. \n\nOn my second visit, I dined with my husband at the bar which was nice as we were able to be seated right away without a reservation. \n\nSome of the other dishes I've had here are:\n\n* Kubaneh (bread with similar consistency to a croissant - amazing!)\n* Jerusalem bagel (dont see on current menu)\n* Hummus 1 and 2\n* Crispy Halloumi\n* Harissa Fried Chicken Skins\n* Octopus\n* Akko Prawns (just ok not great)\n* Short Rib Tajine (delicious)\n* Braised Lamb Shank\n\nI'd recommend Aziza for their food, ambiance and great service!",

        "text": "I have tried menu different cuisines and exotic creations in different countries and rarely come across places that give \"aha moments\" anymore. Aziza has been just that tonight. \nFood has been an amazing experience: felt authentic and homy yet you would get the fusion and modern touch of the chef in every dish. \n \nFood: We started with Hummus no. 2 which was extremely flavorful served with a yummy bread. Tuna Tartare was perhaps the best Tartare I have tried in any place served with freshly baked thin crisps. Don't pass on the grilled Octopus as it tastes so amazing that I wish I had ordered few of them as my main. (I am typically not a fan of Octopus but this one tasted very different). \nMain was the Grilled Lamb Shoulder decorated in pomegranate and cucumber salsa and served with fava been rice. Lamb literally melted in my mouth as it was adequately cooked to still stay tender and juicy on the inside. \n \nDrinks: We ordered Schug shake (Tequila, lime, herbs) which was amazing and the cucumber Daiquiri (rum, mezcal, lime, cucumber) which had an interesting taste but not my favorite at all. I did notice that most folks drink wine so if you have oenophilia, this could be your place for the night. \n \nDesserts: we ordered apple Boureka (definitely recommend it) along with the Pistachio Cream Puffs for my girl friend's birthday. Both are must-haves in my view, unique, tasty and ENOUGH to send you home happy and blissful. \n \nAmbiance: Very cozy, intimate, high energy yet peaceful as the lights are dimmed down. You feel you are not alone and can enjoy others' synergy yet you have enough privacy of your own. \n \nService: Stellar. Out host and our server (Ozzy) were amazing. Ozzy attended to us frequently, was very friendly yet professional and offered up his best recommendations. \n \nOverall amazing experience and can't wait to go back to try out the rest of the menu!",

That being said, here's why it's worth it.\n\nFor starters, the interior is dimly lit, but still has fair visibility with natural lighting. Definitely Mediterranean inspired decor. The tables are spread through out. It's not the largest dining area, but it can definitely accommodate a crowd. This place get's packed by the way. Reservations are a must!\n\nThe day I went they had a set menu. You could choose certain aspects of it, but for the most part it was fixed. Check out the photos for more details. I'm kind of glad it was set, since all the items on the menu were delicious. \n\nThe hummus and bread was amazing. It got better with the oysters and lamb tar tar as well. The lamb shank is super tender and juicy. I could go on and on, but you get the picture.\n\nOverall, a great place to dine at. Food and service was amazing. Definitely worth checking out!\n\nAs always thanks for reading! Until next time!",

        "text": "We loved this place. It's unique and cool with delicious food and great service. If you're looking for a fun new restaurant to check out in Atlanta, put Aziza on your list.\n\nThese guys opened July 25, 2019 at Westside Provisions District underneath Marcel. Free parking is located on-site in the nearby deck or large surface lot on the other side of the building, outside Jeni's. Aziza opened concurrently with Falafel Nation, its sister restaurant next door. Falafel Nation is a takeout joint. This is a sit-down restaurant.\n\nAziza serves modern Israeli food. The owner, who also owns Bellina Alimentari, is from Israel. The menu changes daily.\n\nThe restaurant has a neat, low-key vibe. It feels like a restaurant you'd find in Manhattan or San Francisco. The dining room, bar, and kitchen are beautiful. It's a contemporary design with Middle Eastern touches like woven pendant lamps and lanterns in the walls. The atmosphere is casual, but sophisticated. This is a great date spot and it works well for small groups too. They have four semi-circular booths, ideal for groups of 4-6. The dining room seats about 70 and there's also a private room for about 15.\n\nBook your reservations for free using OpenTable and earn dining points that can be used towards future discounts at other restaurants or an Amazon gift card.\n\nOur group sat next to the open kitchen. My fiancee and I faced the kitchen and had a lot of fun watching the chefs in action, especially when dinner service hit its peak. The kitchen features a showcase wood-burning oven where many of the restaurant's dishes are cooked. We saw several of the items we ordered cooked in that oven, sometimes served almost immediately to us. We visited on a Monday night and it was relatively busy -- a good sign.\n\nThe menu is designed for sharing. During our visit, there were 17 items on the dinner menu and 4 items on the dessert menu. Prices for most dishes were $12-36 each. Desserts, $9-11 each. I did see a 30-day dry-aged 48-oz porterhouse for $135 and \"The Full Experience\" (bread, hummus, 2 small plates, 2 entrees, and dessert for the entire table; 2-person minimum) for $65 per person. According to the cocktail menu, Aziza's cocktails are inspired by the Levant, the region that includes Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and other countries. Aziza has a sizeable selection of alcoholic beverages including digestifs and fortified wine, plus a few non-alcoholic cocktails too.\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nCocktail:\n* Fields of Flora ($14) - pisco, brandy, orange, lemon lime, rose, orange flower, yogurt\n\nSmall plates and entrees:\n* Hummus No. 1 ($15) - Moroccan braised oxtails, apricots; served with laffa\n* Jerusalem Mix ($17) - veal sweetbreads, chicken liver mousse, feuille de brick\n* Roasted Eggplant ($14) - charred tahina, Pearson peach amba, pickles, egg\n* Kibbeh Nayyeh ($18) - Border Springs lamb tartare, bulgar crisp, sumac onions, ras el hanout\n* Octopus ($19) - sunchoke, Aleppo, squid ink tahini\n* Akko Prawns ($34) - falafel toast, Chraimeh, heirloom tomato, Persian lime, cilantro\n\nDessert:\n* Honey Apple Konafi ($11) - crispy phyllo, caramelized apples, toasted honey chiboust, Madagascar vanilla pastry cream, pistachio\n* Kibbutz Moran ($10) - passion fruit curd, pistachio frangipane tart, fig sorbet, fall fruits\n\nIn general, everything was delicious. The dishes ranged from good to great. My favorites were the Hummus No. 1, Jerusalem Mix, Kibbeh Nayyeh, and Honey Apple Konafi. I recommend all of those. The presentation of the cocktail and dishes was excellent. Every dish looked like a detailed work of art.\n\nAziza's hummus is the best I've had in Atlanta and one of the best I've had anywhere. The oxtails and apricots made it that much better. In terms of taste and consistency, it seemed perfect in every way. The Jerusalem Mix was like eating crispy spring rolls filled with soft and savory sweetbreads and liver mousse. Absolutely delectable. I was unsure how the Kibbeh Nayyeh was going to turn out. It was perhaps a risky pick, but I loved it. It was seasoned well and packed with flavor. The bulgur crisps could've been thicker. The Honey Apple Konafi, I've never had anything like it. It was very sweet and rich, but so good. It was sort of like a play on baklava, but much, much better. Definitely try it.\n\nThe Fields of Flora was smooth, creamy, and refreshing. The Roasted Eggplant and Octopus were creative and appetizing. The tangy peach amba and the salty squid ink were my favorite parts of each dish, respectively. The plating of the Akko Prawns was eye-popping. The buttery falafel toast melted in my mouth. Speaking of eye-popping, the Kibbutz Moran fit the bill too. The fruits were colorful, fresh, and ripe.\n\nThe staff - Kristina, Demario, and the chef overseeing things (didn't get his name) - and service were all terrific.\n\nOverall, I give Aziza 4.5 stars rounded up to 5. The bump up is for the originality and novelty of the dishes which you can't find anywhere else in Atlanta.",

        "text": "Wow wow wow! This is one of our new favorite spots! Aziza is a perfect spot for a date night or to take your parents out when they're in town visiting. The atmosphere, food and service are all just great.\n\n*** Food ****\n\nI want to start by saying that we did not order the \"Full Experience\" ($85/person) but next time we totally will so will update this review when we've tried that.\n\nWe did not order any entrees but instead a bunch of the small plates and desserts which was plenty. We ordered a Hummus No. 1, Tuna Tartare and the Wood Fired Shrimp. First, all of the portions were larger than we expected so that was great. As for the food - it was all amazing! If you were to order only one item, make it be the Tuna Tartare... it was simply the best Tuna Tartare we've ever tasted. The Humus was also very good and plentiful. And the Wood Fired Shrimp were yummy as well but next time we would substitute the shrimp for another item.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Peach and Apricot and the Cherry Strawberry Tart. Both were so good. I could have eaten 3 of the Cherry Strawberry Tarts.\n\nHonestly, the food was amazing - far exceeded our expectations!\n\n*** Drinks ***\n\nFor drinks, we had the Dead Sea Gimlet and the Al Fresco. Both drinks were very refreshing. The Dead Sea Gimlet was the better drink of the two however, both were great options.\n\n*** Service ***\n\nService was great. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Our server was amazing and you could tell she genuinely new the menu when making recommendations. But again, I don't think you could go wrong with any choice made at Aziza.\n\n*** Atmosphere ***\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty great. You feel like you're really in a small restaurant in a small Israeli town.\n\n*** Value ****\n\nIf you're visiting for a nice date night or taking your parents for a nice dinner, then the price is on point. It may be a tad on the high side for just a random night out. But if we're talking value, I'd pay double for that Tuna Tartare.",

        "text": "My boyfriend took me out for a belated birthday dinner, and he chose Aziza because we've been excited about its opening since we saw the first signs go up. We went big so we could try lots of different dishes. Here's what we ordered: hummus with braised oxtail, flash-fried halloumi cheese with tomatoes and peaches, grilled octopus with potatoes and potato crisps, one hell of a lamb shank with sauce that tasted a little like gingerbread, and trout with mashed potatoes wrapped in crispy potato pieces. \n\nI also had a cocktail called the something swizzler (rum, coconut and lime) that had a strange aftertaste to it. But that was my least favorite part of the meal. \n\nThe hummus was delicious - thick enough to eat straight with a fork, and the oxtail was so tender and great. It comes with a seasoned pita bread. \n\nThe two starters (halloumi cheese and the octopus) were excellent. Dare I say, the Halloumi may be one of the top two things we ordered (the lamb was the other). The tomatoes and peaches that came with the flash-fried cheese bites were so fresh. I could eat that dish every day - it was that good. The octopus was also tasty - very light (not chewy at all) and had a blackened taste to it. I'm not a big fan of octopus in general, but this was very good, and the potatoes that came with it were amazing. \n\nWe got two entrees - the lamb shank and the trout. I love lamb, and it's one of those things I don't make myself, so it's always a win when it's on the menu. This was so good. So tender, such a unique, almost sweet flavor to it (maybe brown sugar? We couldn't pinpoint it.). It came with rice, chickpeas, and pomegranate seeds. All delicious. And a huge portion. The trout was good, but my boyfriend is much more of a fish guy than me, so I wasn't in love with it. It came with mashed potatoes wrapped in tiny fried potatoes (I think?) - it almost looked like a savory cannoli! Those potatoes were amazing - even better than the fish. \n\nThe presentation of each dish was absolutely beautiful. The flavors of each dish was unique. And once we ordered, each serving (hummus, starters, entrees) came out one after the other, as soon as we were ready for more. That said, we were there on a Monday night, so I can't speak for the service on a busier night.  Our server was very professional and cordial. We took almost the whole lamb dish back home for dinner the next night because it was a lot of food. For two hungry people, hummus, two starters and one entree would probably be plenty of food. \n\nOh! There's a casual to-go falafel shop next door (connected, same owners) if you just want to sample the cuisine without a big fancy sit-down dinner. I definitely want to try that. We can't wait to go back!",

I had not had Israeli food before, and some of the meat dishes were a definite \"NO\" for me. \n\nWell, color me shocked.  And impressed. I just had one of the best meals in years. \n\nWe ordered both of the hummus dishes.  Both were absolutely delicious.  We coupled these with both of the bread selections- forgot the names but they are at the top of the menu.  You MUST order both breads - they were amazing.  \n\nI ordered the red snapper dish and was happy that it was mild to the taste.  It was delicious.  The potato side that came with it was delicious as well. \n\nThe dessert item that I chose (donut dish) wasn't bad but a pinch unimpressive.   I would try another dessert next tine (was decent but a waste of calories to me).  The Turkish coffee wasn't my fave either.  \n\nAnyway, I'm well equipped for another visit, and soon! Recommended!",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I went for an early dinner. We were able to easily get a reservation online and were seated immediately when we arrived. The atmosphere had low but warm lighting and a smokiness in the air that came from the wood oven. The dishes range from bread courses like heavily-seeded Jerusalem bagels to small plates to entrees. We got both of the hummuses (which come with a warm pita-like bread), the okra (which also has shishito peppers), the Jerusalem mix, the eggplant, and the octopus. After that we were definitely full, so bear in mind that the small plates are filling! \n\nThe Jerusalem mix was a favorite. It oddly enough smelled like McDonald's hashbrowns, but in the best way possible. It's got an egg roll-like outer skin that's perfectly crispy. We also really liked the eggplant, which was paired with a perfect series of dollops and smears of sauces. We were too full to try dessert, but they have a lovely moroccan tea service and Turkish coffee service that we want to try when we come back! \n\nThere's a room in the back that's large for a party but intimate and warm. Aziza is a unique and welcome addition to the Atlanta restaurant scene.",

        "text": "Had an amazing meal here - impressive food, service, ambience, and COVID-19 precautions. You're able to reserve tables online via OpenTable, which includes an option to select if you'd like to sit indoor or outdoors (note that there are not heaters outdoors). Inside, the decor is cozy and refined. There's hand sanitizer on every table (nicely scented!), everyone is seated far apart, all staff wears masks, and they wiped down our table in between courses. In pre-COVID times, arriving to see an almost empty restaurant wouldn't be a good sign, but we were pleasantly surprised to have the place almost to ourselves.\n\nThe food is amazing - it's not trying to be traditionally authentic Israeli food, but is certainly a nice modern / Americanized interpretation. We opted for \"The Full Experience\" which was pricey, but a lot of food and a fun way to try out a variety of menu items. You are able to select a hummus, two appetizers, two entrees, a dessert, and turkish coffee service. Given that we don't eat out much, it was a fun splurge and truly felt like a special experience instead of just a meal. The Kubaneh lived up the hype - likely one of the best pieces of bread I've ever eaten (think buttery croissant ^100). We also enjoyed the brussels, short rib tangine, and lamb shank - the entrees were very generous portions and overall we came home with a lot of leftovers. The baklava cheesecake is a must-get - very unique and super delicious.\n\nService was the perfect balance between attentive but not disruptive. Overall, we had an amazing time and really appreciated a special meal that felt safe.",

        "text": "I think this place just propelled itself to one of my favourite restaurants in the whole country. The service, the ambience, the location... each can only be described as *chef's kiss* perfection. \n\nBut the star of the show: the FOOD...\n\nAppetiser - Octopus: I have never known octopus to be so soft and tender. Where has this octopus been all its life? Living massage to massage? Rubbed up and down with the finest extra virgin olive oil the world has to offer? This is without a doubt the best octopus I have ever had, and just this one dish alone is enough to give the restaurant a 5 star rating.\n\nEntree 1 - Short Rib Tajine: We ordered this dish out of curiosity as we are unfamiliar with many Middle Eastern and North African cuisines and wanted to try something new. My goodness were those short ribs tender. Fall off the bone and so flavourful all throughout!\n\nEntree 2 - Grilled Lamb Shoulder: Again, another of the most tender meat I've had in my life. I have no idea how this restaurant does it but it never fails. And pairing the savoury lamb with sweet pomengrenate? Genius! More restaurants should be doing this! Why aren't they? The perfect combination of sweet, sour, and savoury.\n\nDessert - Raspberry Tart with Sorbet: I think I died and my soul went to heaven. Words cannot describe how exquisite this dish was. The perfect levels of tartness combined with sweet, offset by the palateability of the crumbly pastry. I loved it. \n\nBetween the dessert and the appetiser alone, I'll happily give this place a 5 star. Pair in everything else, if I could give 10 stars, I would. Love it.",

The best part of the night by far was meeting the greatest bartenders Summer and David, they were fun, talented with the cocktail creations and also pretty knowledgeable with the liquors. My husband and I both learned quite a bit about some of our favorite drinks. We can't wait to go back! Thanks for the fun night!! Couldn't recommend this place enough.",

I sat at the bar and was helped by the male bartender who was very nice and made a good drink. The other bartender seemed irritated when I asked what she recommended on the menu. I ordered the raw scallops that were pretty good, and the lamb ribs which were also pretty good but not great. And the arugula salad it came with wasn't terrible but really salty .. the reason for 3 stars is because there were ants crawling all over the bar.. having worked in the service industry I know that it happens but the amount was absurd.",

I've never been to a true ethnic restaurant that has needed additional seasoning. We had to ask for salt and pepper for the short ribs. The hummus was some sort of runny purée - not bad, but not good either; and definitely can't be labeled as hummus. \n\nPros: awesome, friendly and patient staff. \nThat's all I got ‍\n\nIf you have money to throw away, send me a private message and I'll send you a list of charities that can really use the money right now.",

        "text": "WOW! Aziza blew me away. What a dining experience. Definitely one of the best up and coming restaurants I've eaten at in the past year. \n\nIt's a pricey restaurant but for the service and the food... Aziza is worth every penny. I don't usually jump at the prospect of Israeli food, but was excited to try something new. \n\nIn the opening month, the restaurant was booked solid. We were able to score a reservation at 9pm on a Saturday night, which is insane since they close at 10pm. The table for 4 was pretty small, especially since we are all big eaters and love trying a little bit of everything. \n\nOur server Tugrul was super friendly and funny! I'm thankful that I saved our receipt so I could remember his name... \n\nI started off with a cocktail. I was feeling something I could sip on throughout the meal, so the Break of the Strait, which was a mixture of gin, savory herbs, mint and orange bitters. I wouldn't recommend chugging this one unless you're planning on crawling home. \n\nWe ordered quite a few dishes and I can't say there was a single bad dish. Every dish had its own uniqueness and quirk to it:\n\nJerusalem Bagel: basically a large sesame bagel served with butter. It was super nutty and a delicious way to start the meal while waiting for our food.  \nHummus no. 2: I'm not usually a big fan of hummus; at least, I don't crave it. But when topped with maitakes and pomegranate seeds? I'm pretty sure I would eat this again every day if I could. \nJerusalem Mix: who knew a mix of sweetbreads, liver and pastry could be so freaking delicious. I don't usually crave offal, Aziza has made them in a mix that I can't turn down a taste of. \nWatermelon Salad: I'm a huge fan of the combination of feta and watermelon but this was a combination unlike any watermelon feta I've ever had. I think it may have been the harissa but it had a kick to it that was addicting. \nOctopus: super delicious - we were literally scraping and licking the sauce off the plate. My only complaint was that there wasn't more octopus to go around. \nAkko Prawns: THIS is the dish to order. I could eat a whole platter of these prawns! From the fresh prawn to the flavors in the sauce... it was pure perfection. A must order for the indecisive. \nBraised Lamb Shank: WOW that lamb shank just falls off the bone. The meat was so tender and irresistible. Another must order. \n\nAnd of course, dessert. Both desserts we tried were delicious. We ordered the peach pavlova and the banana pudding Konafi. Both desserts were beautifully plated. \n\nI would come back here again and again if I could afford to. I just can't wait for my next dinner plans at Aziza!",

        "text": "Had date night here a few days ago and really enjoyed it. It was between a four and five star experience for me.\n\n*Great space (five stars)\n\n*Cheerful service (four stars)\n\n*Cocktails and wine were good (on pricey side, even for an upper tier Atlanta restaurant). In particular, both the schug shake (tequilla-based) and cucumber daiquiri (mezcal-based) were very good. Our server was very friendly but not well-versed or particularly familiar with the wine list. (Four to 4.5 stars)\n\n*The bread course-hummus and kubaneh (a fluffy Israeli bread)-was very tasty. The hummus was smooth with the right balance of oil and tahini. We had never had kubaneh before but it was a delicious croissant like pastry. The tomato \"dip\" that accompanied the kubaneh was forgettable. The only \"downside\" is cost- these two breads and dips cost more than $25, which is very expensive for this type of food. That said, the quality was excellent. \n\n*the appetizers course was overall good. We ordered the brussel sprouts and octopus. The octopus was excellent- probably the best I've ever had (five stars).  The brussel sprouts and mushrooms were severely charred (intentionally) and passable but nothing special (and certainly overpriced at $15)\n\n*mains - we ordered the veal osso bucco and feta & herb gnocchi. The osso bucco was underwhelming. Not much meat and not really a traditional osso bucco. I was very excited about the pairing with tamarind but it didn't really work. The plating felt messy with the components not really complimenting each other (oily rice without much flavor). Pretty disappointing dish (two stars). The gnocchi on the other hand was delicious but a little lacking on gnocchi itself (plenty of parsnips and sunchokes though)  (four plus stars)  \n\n*we finished with the milk & honey dessert. It was very tasty. The honey mousse was airy and smooth. Highly recommend (five stars)  \n\nBecause the menu changes seasonally,  I look forward to trying Aziza again. It was an expensive meal (admittedly it did feel a little overpriced), but we overall enjoyed it and the restaurant itself.",

        "text": "There were so many things going on that I decided to list the pros and cons to help future diners. \n\nPros:  The food was great!  We ordered the \"full experience\" for $65 each and the food was outstanding. It took us 2 1/2 hours for a party of six to eat all of the food and there was plenty of it.. The two types of bread were both outstanding and you couldn't go wrong with either hummus. Be sure to get the octopus as one of the small plates because it was smoky and may have been the highlight of the night to everyone that ate. Our group had the red snapper and the leg of lamb as the main dishes and we were not disappointed. The \"full experience\" came with a dessert also, so we were stuffed!  The service was great and they spaced out the courses really well. \n\nCons:  Pricey - By the time we included our tip, the bill for the six of us was $650.   Like I said, there was a lot of food so you need to go there when you are hungry. If we had to do it again, we would probably order just the entrées around $35 and a small plate $15.  Corkage fee- there was some confusion. I called the day before and was told the corkage fee was $20. When I got there, our waiter told us the corkage fee was 25. The manager was then called over and she said the corkage fee was 35 per bottle (outrageous as I have never paid more than 25 for corkage anywhere).  I showed her my phone where I had called the previous day and the mgr was quick to honor the $20 per bottle, but there is quite a difference between 20, 25, and 35.  I strongly suggest that you get clarity on this issue if you are going to bring your own bottles with you.",

        "text": "This is a mini review as I only had appetizers and dessert. \n\nI've been reading about this place for a couple months before it opened and I was excited because I don't have much experience with Israeli food. I came by around 7 after and appointment in the area and I knew I couldn't stay too long so I decided to go the app dessert route. I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted. When deciding my first app, I chose the Jerusalem bagel but my server strongly suggested that I get the Kubahneh. She was right. It was soo good! The flakey, buttery crust was delicious and the dipping sauce was pretty spicy but I couldn't stop eating it. I then went with the Halumi salad which was bright with the peaches and tomatoes. I decided to end the dinner with the peach pavlova. It was almost too pretty to eat. But it was also really light and not too sweet. Perfect end to the meal. \n\nI really enjoyed my visit to Aziza. I plan to return to have a full meal.",

I did actually enjoy most of the items we ordered.\nPortion on the other side was like the course menu items from Bacchanalia=tiny.\nGood thing I was on a diet this week, otherwise I would've gone to other nearby restaurants for more food. (We did go to Jeni's afterwards)\nGood place to come if you are on a diet. Good quality food at tiny portions.\nThe prawn/toast dish we ordered had literally 3 prawns (small to medium sized) on a toast and this was an entree dish, not an app.\nAnd the price was near $30..\nDidn't understand this concept since this restaurant's concept wasn't fine dining.\n\nService was pretty good and friendly, considering that it was their opening night. \nWait wasn't long. We were seated pretty quickly and food came out at a decent time. \nAmbiance was pretty laid back with middle eastern style decor.\n\nWill I be back? Unlikely, but maybe when I am on a diet and craving good middle eastern cuisine..\nI would give 3.5 stars but rounded up to 4.",

        "text": "I wanted to to give this place 4-5 stars. Maybe at the 2nd visit that will be possible. They need to work out some serious kinks. The first issue was reservations. Our time was for 8:15. Not a big group. We had to wait 20 or more minutes to be seated. The hostesses seemed stressed and had a 'deer in the headlights' look from the moment we arrived. The excuse we could'nt be seated was 'we are waiting for a group to get up after they paid'. Not what you need to say to waiting patrons with reservations. Come up with something more proactive and reassuring like 'there's been a delay but we are actively working on your table and you're the next to be seated'. \n\nNext was the bartenders. Just wow. I wish I could've given them 1 star. They were unfriendly and didn't seem happy to be there. The drink, the Harissa something was entirely too spicy. I asked for a splash of soda and he seemed annoyed. He then grabbed a bottle that had been open and was flat, poured it in the glass and most of it went all over my hand. But he ignored that, didn't offer me a napkin and went back to work. Sorry I'm not a drip dry kinda person. I looked around for a napkin, where they should be on the bar and saw none. I had to ask him for one. He reached to some area behind him and grabbed one. As he handed it to me he says \"I hide them!\". Ok wow. Why? \n\nUpon finally getting seated the intro to the menu was nice. The servers were pleasant. Although everyone seemed a little frassled. The food was excellent barring one dish. We shared the:\n\n- Kubaneh - amazing fluffy popover style bread with a smoky tomato and herby sauce \n(Excellent)\n- Brussel Sprouts - seasoned with onions, sumac and tahini. (Excellent)\n- Octopus- the best I've had in Atlanta. Extremely tender and flavorful. More potatoes would've been nice. 3 on the plate wasn't enough. \n- Butternut Squash with Arugula, apples, labneh, pumpkin seed. (My favorite! Excellent)\n- Roasted Eggplant - Charred tahina, peach and crumbled egg. JUST NO. The charred sauce underneath literally smelled like animal urine. As I lifted the fork to my mouth I was overwhelmed with this smell. I told the waitress they need to rethink this. Please just do a traditional baba ganoush. We managed to scrape all that off and just eat the eggplant. The crumbled egg white on top, although creative wasn't my favorite. \n\nStand outs were the kubaneh bread, octopus and butternut squash salad. \n\nOverall the food was good and would be willing to try it again.",
