The poblano rice was very good, as was the Yuka potatoes and esquite.  Also sad that el pastor is not an option here.",

        "text": "This restaurant had a bit of a difficult parking situation since you have to park in the Terminus building, and we didn't see that at first. They do validate though so be sure to ask! \n\nThe ambiance was very Buckhead in our opinion- very upbeat, social, and a little bit on the classier side. I loved the music choice. Although the servers seemed very attentive, it did feel as though we were a bit rushed at the end there to leave, despite there not really being a line. \n\nThe food was exquisitely cooked, but I do have to take a star away because the menu did not give a warning as to how spicy some things were. As someone who unfortunately cannot tolerate spice well at all, I wish I had had a better gauge for the spice level of the different dishes as a lot of them had moles but they were spicy. We ordered the guacamole which was a bit salty and the coffee rubbed flat iron as well as the chicken al carbon. Again, the food was of excellent quality, but the moles were just not our favorites.",

        "text": "definitely beautifully decorated. They have an indoor/outdoor seating area, which opens up to the restaurant as well. It's very spacious. We did make reservations, but when we went, it was empty. I do know it gets busy on the weekends here. Amazing drinks, absolutely delicious. You have to order chips and salsa here and there high-end chips with delicious salsa. It is a high-end Mexican restaurant so it is expensive. it's a fantastic place to bring date and eat apps and get drinks. It's also a great place for friends as there's lots of spacious areas. They do have vegetarian options. I got the salad, which was pretty good, I would've wanted it to have a little more flavor, but it was delicious and healthy. I also got what looked like dumplings, and they were exactly as described, but I was not a fan of the texture. They were unique and for that I give them props but overall I wouldn't order the dumplings again. They do have lots of other traditional Mexican food. I opted to get those two things because they were new and unique. This is a little bit of a fusion as well if I'm not mistaken. At least it appears that way in my opinion. I would definitely come here again.",

If I wanted to put pants on and go trekking around the hotel for 20 minutes to find utensils, I certainly would not have paid $31 for some corn and plantains.  I would have eaten the free food in the bar. But yet...I waited at the bar, by the free food, to get utensils to eat my $30 food.

        "text": "Arrived in Buckhead seeking a nice place for dinner and we found it. Upon entering this place screams classy. Nicely decorated, a good sized bar and tables inside and out to give lots of seating options. We were fortunate to grab these booths that seat 2 (or 3) makes you feel removed from the entire restaurant. \n\nWhile at a Mexican restaurant, must have tequila. I was intrigued by these specialty drinks that feature a coffee and canela infused ice cube, so the Anejo was served. Unfortunately there wasn't Don Julio, but Herraduras subbed in just nicely. \n\nFor appetizer, the HUITLACOCHE EMPANADAS were served. Now this is different. Empanadas filled with a corn mushroom and spinach served with a delicious sauce. The entire dish was devoured by my wife and I. \n\nMain course we shared the coffee rubbed flat iron steak. Cooked medium rare and accompanied with sweet potato, broccolini and mole. The dish was good, but the steak was certainly the star of the dish. Felt like the garnish/pairings could have been better. \n\nDessert was mixed. The dessert taco seemed like a great idea, but in the end it was meh. This was comped and we opted for the churros. Huge portion with dipping sauce. \n\nOverall, it's a great place. You won't be disappointed.",

My friend heard great things about it so we decided to go there for dinner on a weekday night.  \n\nOur waitress was excellent and made great recommendations. We decided to start with the guacamole and the signature Alma Cocina chips, which looked more like a tostada and tasted crunchy and great. I had the Naranjarita margarita--super tasty and strong with a sugar rim. For dinner, I opted for the red snapper. It had a delicious flavor but I wasn't a fan of the fava beans and garnish. My friend had the shrimp tacos and it had a nice, spicy kick. Overall, great ambiance and dining experience.",

        "text": "So good we had to go twice in a row! The food, service, and ambiance are stellar. If you are looking for out-of-the-box Mexican food this is the spot. The flavors and presentations aren't what you would expect to get at a Mexican restaurant lending itself to a nice and delicious surprise. Great for date night or a casual meet-up with friends, it won't disappoint.\n\nThe drink program is amazing! Great margaritas and cocktails that pack a punch. The bartenders Blake and Andre know how to make a mean drink. The service staff was also attentive and knowledgeable about the menu making excellent drink and food recommendations, Daphny, Kaci, and Darren really know how to make a guest feel special. The chef even dropped by the table and dropped off an off-menu salad using local greens that were fresh and paired so well with our meal.\n\n The Small Plates serving sizes are perfectly sized, and it isn't overwhelming that you'll end up being full before your main dishes get to the table but also, if you decide to only order small plates for the table you are still guaranteed to leave satisfied. The Mezcal Smoked Salmon was a standout and it will be sure to impress your foodie friends. \n\nWe tried the small plate special of the Bison Fry Bread and I hope it makes it onto the menu full-time because I would love to enjoy that time and time again.\n\nFrom the Main Plates, we had the Carbon Pork Chop and the Butcher Steak. The steak was incredibly tender and perfectly cooked. The pork chop was so juicy and has a nice kick to it.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Brownie, and let me just say you'll want to save some room for dessert you can't miss it.\n\nIf my rambling review hasn't convinced you yet, let me save you the trouble of looking elsewhere, THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO EAT!",

        "text": "Came here for a work dinner and we got to try a lot of the menu. I hear the lunch menu is different from dinner and if you need help deciding, definitely go for dinner. I had 2 drinks, the lavender haze which was a refreshing gin based cocktail and then another one that was a tequila based blueberry cocktail that was a bit smokey. All the cocktails were well crafted. Our servers were quick and efficient with food orders and when they say small plates, believe them. I got the asada steak and was disappointed at how small it was for around $15. The meat however was very flavorful, tender and juicy so I enjoyed every bite. We finished with the brownie that was settled in boiling chocolate. The edges were crunchy and the center soft. Overall a nice spot for happy hour and I'd recommend going earlier in the evening before the music gets turned up if you want to have a conversation. Or take it as an excuse to sit closer to your date! Overall I wasn't particularly impressed but not disappointed either.",

        "text": "The style of the restaurant was chic, but that is pretty much the best thing this place had going for it. We were there on a Sunday night and the place was pretty empty. Our waitress who was very nice was also the bartender. Ironically, she took our drink and appetizer orders, which was 2 margaritas and the fried cheese. We watched as she made a few interesting looking drinks at the bar over a ten minute period (getting excited each time thinking they must be ours), but after a different person brought our apps and we were almost threw with it, she came back to take our dinner order. We asked about the drinks and she realized that she had totally forgotten about them. We decided to just skip the margaritas and move on to dinner. I had the salad with chicken added. The presentation of the salad looked lovely and I was excited to dig in. I have no idea where they got the chicken from, but I have never tasted a worst piece of meat in my life. I was actually nervous to eat it because the texture was so strange. The salad dressing had zero flavor, so I felt like all I could taste was the weird chicken. Even though it was (thankfully) an extremely small amount of chicken on the salad, it completely ruined it for me. I would have expected and much preferred a freshly grilled chicken breast at a pricey place in Buckhead. Overall, it was not the experience we had hoped for and I don't have any plans to return. I wish the taste of the food had lived up to the menu description because we would have been regulars. Hopefully this review will be helpful. I usually don't leave negative reviews, but there are so many positive reviews that led us here, I felt mislead. Maybe we were just there on a bad night and the chef was on vacation ‍",

        "text": "My neighbors finally got together to grab lunch today. 2020 is like it never happened, at least not in Atlanta. I barely ate out, let alone dine with friends. We three have not met for lunch for over a year. One of them suggested Alma Cocina and I do remember awarding them a one star review last year. I believe in second chance though not always, I went ahead and made a reservation via OpenTable.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, there was no one to check in with us. The manager (possibly) finally emerged and offered us either the sanitized traditional menu or we could get a digital copy by scanning the QR code on the sign. So far everything was looking good. He also explained the 20% gratuity the restaurant would be adding on our bill during this pandemic. We have no problem with that.\n\nAMBIANCE 5/5\nThis was my first time at Alma Cocina. The ambience was definitely very nice. I like it. I also like that the restaurant actually limited capacity by blocking out tables throughout the indoor and outdoor seating for social distancing. \n\nSERVICE 4/5\nService was great. Jose was our server and we were sold when he told us about the Today's Special. He corrected himself when he first mentioned the today's special Barbacoa Torta Ahogada was spicy and said it was not that spicy but more of a kick. Unfortunately the dish was a kick on my ar*e, it was too spicy for me and my neighbor.\n\nFOOD 1/5\nUnfortunately none of us really liked our food. The meat were all too salty. Two of us ordered the Beef Short Rib Barbacoa Torta Ahogada and another ordered the goat quesadilla. For us who ordered the torta ahogada, we almost died in the spicy sauce. Go easy on the salt and the spiciness on that torta ahogada and I would really enjoy the dish.\n\nSadly after the lunch, my neighbors been complaining about the lunch even a week after. Good thing I was not the one who made that lunch suggestion :P",

Drinks were good and the front of house team was very attentive, but the kitchen seemed poorly managed.\nAfter ordering guac and returning it because at least some of the batch contained spoiled avocado, the chef sent us the same guac but with more citrus to cover the rotten taste. We were there for Mother's Day brunch, and the menu did not properly describe the food. I also saw that the brioche used for the French toast was from Walmart (not a problem, but not acceptable for a restaurant).\n\nI won't be back and won't recommend Alma to anyone looking for a meal.",

Randomly came across Alma Cocina. Didn't know anything about it. We took a chance. Our risk paid off big time. \n\nThey offer complimentary valet. So no need for a parking lot scavenger hunt. Margaritas were great. I had the Naranjarita. We started off with the complete tastings of guacamole and salsa. Usually, I'm diss appointed by guacamole in the states. But this is the best guacamole I've had in Atlanta! Next, we had the fried Chihuahua cheese with corn tortillas. This dish hit the spot. Cheesy, a little spicy; tasted like a mini cheese quesadilla. Wrapped up the night with carne asada tacos with rice and black beans. It was such a simple taco, but the marinated steak made this taco pop. Finished off the night with the coconut tres leches and churros. \n\nI cannot wait to go back to this spot. A nice addition to Buckhead. My only issue was that we had wait 15min to be seated even though we had a reservation. Otherwise, the service from the valet, to the hostess, to the servers was top notch.",

For my lunch I ordered Masa Fried Shrimp Tacos, instead of rice and bean.  I replaced with the Esquites (street corn).  The shrimp tacos was good.  But the star of the lunch was the esquites.  That was the reason I came here for lunch.  I was glad I did, up till now I still remember how good the corn is.

Also, if you have a peanut allergy you're safe to eat here. \n\nThe guacamole is a great way to start off your meal. A single order of it can serve 1-3 comfortably. It is served with a side of chips. \n\nThe fried avocado street tacos were the highlight of the meal for me. These tacos come with fried avocado, crispy queso cotija, and macha verde. They are outstanding. The fried avocado has really nice texture. Crisp on the outside, with a soft, refreshing avocado bite on the inside. Fried food that you will not feel guilty after. \n\nI highly recommend Alma, and I look forward to returning.",

This place has potential ! \n\nTacos - Fried avocado tacos were perfectly breaded and accompanied with flavorful pico. Loved the shrimp tacos, you could taste every single flavor in these!!! The side of beans were cooked perfect. Saving the best for last. The vegetarian combinations was my favorite of all dishes. Out of all the three, the favs bean item was my fav. This dish blew me away ... \n\nDrinks: I didn't venture out with any new cocktails. I endulces in my usually (spicy Marg) it wasn't anything special. I would have loved to have some pepper of some I'm sort inside. However, I did enjoy the Tajin rim. \n\nOn a must return for Taco Tuesday \n\nParking - Valet , tipping encouraged\n\n*Tip - They just started a Happy Hour - 4pm",

The empanadas were tasty but different from the empanadas I am accustomed to eating. They have cheese and vegetables inside and they come with a sauce that balance them perfectly. I ordered a paloma to go with my meal and it was the only thing I ordered that I wouldn't get again. The couple next to me ordered the cheese appetizer and after seeing it I think I would try that next time.

They were both 10/10. \nWe tried the octopus which was the best octopus we had ever had at a restaurant, I love the taste and fruits on the plate!\nI got the lechoncito tacos and my bf got the chicken frajitas which we both enjoyed however, the rice and beans were pretty salty and the \"fajita\"-like entree had a poor choice of toppings.... Maybe some lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream instead?....\nLastly, we ended w/ coffee and dessert, the dessert w/ the banana mousse which tasted so unique and good. My waiter mentioned that she made my coffee and it was so yummy and tasted perfect.\nThe vibe here was just so quiet and chill... definitely coming back :)",

        "text": "I visited with a large group, I believe there were sixteen of us. We had a space on the Peachtree side of the restaurant and the ambiance was 5/5. For some reason, most of the night we had just one server and the bar managed to swap strawberry agua fresca for blood orange margaritas we ordered. They made it right in the end. Overall, it was good experience, just required some patience. I would go back but make sure to do so with a smaller party.",

The service is amazing and the food is delicious. \n\nI came here for a business lunch and we sat on the patio.  Note that this is a non-cash restaurant, but who uses cash these days?!?\n\nAt the present moment they aren't accepting tips given the mandatory 18% service charge, but you can leave a cash tip, if you wish.",

        "text": "COVID- super tall ceilings and airy inside. They have outdoor seating that looked like one of those half indoor/ half outdoor space (meaning it was not completely outdoor patio style seating). I saw some indoor seating that was in its own walled off booth like a cubby space. They also X out and do every other table. \n\nSPECIAL NOTE- they automatically do 20% tipping (when I went end of May 2021) due to pandemic and taking care of staff. I thought that was fair. \n\nVIBE- very sophisticated chic, modern, trendy. This is a good date place! \n\nPARKING- validate parking for 2 hrs. \n\nDRINKS- delicious. THE BEST SPICY MARG IVE HAD IN A LONG TIME. Since heat of jalapeños vary by season and farm, they use some type of spice dropper so the spice/ heat level of consistent. It has a decent kick... I would say the person amount. I tried two different ice cube drinks. Their most popular one was sold out so my partner got the purée one. Delicious. I later ordered the horchata one and it was rly bad. The purée one became a slushie whereas mine became a weird powdery drink and went the ice cube finally melted completely, it was watered down. I really think they should take that off the menu or reformulate it. \n\nFOOD- delicious. We got the guac/ salsa combo and later used that in our main meal. The chips they provide you are fresh and so good! I don't think they were fried right before serving but they were definitely fresh. I got tacos and I cannot complain.",
