                "text": "I used to eat Peruvian food somewhat regularly when I lived in Miami, and I didn't realize how much I was missing/craving it until friends suggested that we eat at Tio Lucho's. They'd already been a few times and thought it would be right up our alley -- and they were right! There were four of us and we ordered a bunch of dishes to share:\n\n-Ceviche Mixto: this was the spiciest of the things we ate. I don't tolerate spice very well and I found this to be delicious. The rocoto leche de tigre was insane and the fish was so fresh and perfectly \"cooked\" in the acid. \n-Pulpo Anticuchero: perfectly cooked octopus, excellent flavors.\n-Crawfish Tostones: I'm not a fan of tostones, or crawfish, but wow, I couldn't stop eating this. Typically the dish is served with three pieces, and our server suggested adding a fourth so that we could each have one (brilliant!).\n-Lomo Saltado: perfectly tender steak, great all around.\n-Chaufa de Mariscos: the Lomo Saltado came with jasmine rice (which was delicious in its own right) but this was a great way to round out the meal. \n\nWe opted not to have dessert but we did enjoy a few cocktails including the pisco sour, the maracuya pisco sour (passionfruit), and the spicy margarita. All delicious! This was an amazing meal all around. Our server was very friendly and helpful but tended to disappear from time to time. But we were enjoying the company, ambiance, food, and drink that it wasn't too bad. The restaurant offers validated parking for the garage directly behind -- also a great bonus for this part of town! I definitely see us returning again and again.",

                "text": "I invited my wife to dinner at Tio Lucho on Saturday night to celebrate her birthday. This was our third time dining here since we discovered this gem last year. Since my wife is from Peru, we have always wished for an upscale and creative Peruvian restaurant in Atlanta, and Tio Lucho delivers. The menu offers some traditional Peruvian dishes with a delicate and creative twist. My wife's favorite is the Ceviche Carretillero, which has a perfect combination of grouper ceviche and fried calamari, providing an excellent combination of flavors and textures to the palate. We decided to order several dishes to share and were impressed by how fresh and well-presented the food was. In addition to the Cheviche Carretillero, we enjoyed the Causa de Pollo, Pollo Anticuchos, Arroz con Mariscos, Crawfish Tostones,  and Grouper Ceviche. In addition to the great food, the whole staff was very attentive and friendly, which made it a perfect evening.\nThey also offer a happy hour with drinks and appetizer specials, including raw oysters. We will be back to keep going down the menu and try the variety of dishes they offer. \nWe enjoyed the food so much that I only had a chance to snap two pictures of the dishes attached.\nThank you so much for bringing this creative Peruvian restaurant to Atlanta!",

It does have a pur\u00e9e in it so be mindful of the texture. \n\nThe fish collar was cooked perfectly. The fish was moist and tender. The seasoning and sauce paired perfectly together. \n\nThe crab tostones were so unique and so delicious. All of the flavors balance perfectly. The tostone is sweet plantain, not crispy so it worked well with the sweetness of the crab. This was definitely my favorite dish. \n\nMy friend enjoyed the lomo saltado. I'm a pescatarian so I didn't try it, but it's a Peruvian staple. \n\nOverall we had two entrees, 4 drinks, and one appetizer + two side sauces ($3 each) for $150. A little more than I'd like to spend but on par with restaurants in Atlanta.",

Looks like he was not in a good mood because he was working alone but it's not the customers' fault correct?\nThe first drink he made was not good, it was supposed to be a Caipiroska but it tasted like something else. Then we tried the Moscow Mule felt bad did not send it back but it was not it. The ceviche was just ok and the portion very small. I see all these great reviews so I guess we went on a wrong night? We'll never know.\nThe second star is to encourage them to work on their customer service.",

I love that there are fresh, green plants everywhere and the restaurant and bathrooms are nice and clean. The way the restaurant is positioned means that the bright sun shines in the front windows when the sun is setting. I appreciate the staff paying extra attention to this detail and adjusting them accordingly without anyone asking. Those little things mean so much. \nThe food - I feel like this is the part where I give a slow clap and a standing ovation. I ordered a sangria and appetizer from the happy hour menu. The sangria was refreshing and delicious and the yellowfin tiradito made my tastebuds sing. It was the perfect texture balance with a sliver of radish on the top of each piece of tuna. The menu had so many things I wanted to try so I ordered the fish collars on recommendation from the waitress. I'm SO glad I listened. It was beautiful red snapper that was seasoned to perfection with the best crust. The fish was absolutely delightful. It came with a sauce on the side, some thinly sliced fried plantains, and cancha. The portion was so big that I had to take some home, which is not typical when I eat fish.\nI can't forget to highlight the amazing and friendly staff. I loved the suggestions my waitress gave me and appreciated the time she took to answer all of my questions.\nI can't wait to bring friends here. It a fabulous new favorite on my list.",

We came as large group on Wednesday night and were seated pretty quickly and had decent service throughout the night.\n\nI had the lomo saltado and tuna causa to share and then got a chicha morada (was very apprehensive about ordering a corn based drink, but I would totally recommend it!!! So good!!)\n\nOut of the things we got, the tuna causa has a slight edge just bc of my love for good quality raw fish, but overall I enjoyed everything I ate. \n\nIf you're looking to try something new (don't think we have a ton of Peruvian spots in atl), and want something fresh and relatively healthy, I would recommend Tio Luchos!",

Actually a little to juicy for my liking and it lacked flavor. In my opinion it definitely wasn't worth the price tag $45. The salad is good. It came with a spicy dressing that already dressed on the salad. \nIf I dined here again I would only do appetizers. They don't have many dinner options.\nThe restaurant offers validation.

                "text": "Wow! This is my favorite Peruvian spot in Atlanta although I wish they had anticucho. Too Lucho's is advertised as a coastal Peruvian spot and it is so so good. The inside is beautiful and they have so many live plants I found out they had someone come water because they are literally everywhere 100s of beautiful indoor plants. They also have a patio area for dining. \n\nThe corn fritters were a great starter I wish we tried the ceviche but it was only two of us and we weren't starving and were already getting fish for our entrees. The snapper tail was really good as well but didn't steal the spotlight like the snapper collar. I'm a huge fan of fish collars (on large fish) because the meat is always super tender and has a certain fattiness to it that you don't find on parts of the fish besides maybe the fish belly but it's different.\n\nI've been disappointed with most of the Peruvian spots I've visited since I hold Peruvian cuisine in high regard. I've spent two weeks in Lima and Cusco and my perspective is that Peruvian food is some of the best in the world. Recently some of Peru's best restaurants were ranked: Central #1, Maido #6, Kjolle #28, Mayta #47 the top two have been consistently ranked top 50 for many years I believe this is the first time Central has been ranked first. Tio Lucho's lives up to the reviews and best of all it's conveniently located ITP!",

We had a great seat next to the kitchen and bar where we could see everything going on. The food was absolutely delicious. We had a few people in our party that had never eaten Peruvian food and didn't even like seafood- and even they loved it! I recommend the pisco sour cocktail to start. They decorate the top to look like the Peruvian flag. I recommend the ceviche mixto, tuna tiradito, pulpo anticuchero, and of course you have to order the lomo saltado. Not only is everything delicious, but it's plated beautifully.\n\nThey have 2 hour validated parking in the lot behind the restaurant at 275 N Highland apartment building. This is really great, especially in midtown.\n\nI love that we now have a very much needed Peruvian restaurant located centrally in the city.",

There is outdoor seating also.\n\nOf course, we started with pisco sours because why not? And then split a bottle of red for four. It was a good choice for all entrees. \n\nWe started with ceviche de pescado and Papas y Salasa. The fish was fresh and meaty. Make sure you get a mouthful of everything to get a complete mouthfeel. The papas dish was very pretty. Both starters were great.\n\nI wanted to continue with the seafood so I ordered a fish entree, very pretty, undersalted. The lomo was oversalted but still very good. I poured some of the lomo sauce over the fish to add some saltiness. My friends have been before and said the lomo is not usually oversalted. I still give 5 stars. The star of dinner, though, was the pork chop! It was one of the best pieces of pork I've had, very tender, great flavor. And then the ice cream made from rice was so creamy and tasty, loved it. \n\nThis was an excellent meal! And our server was friendly and accommodating. Would absolutely go back.",

I don't know how to describe it - floor to ceiling windows with a large bar, high top seating by the windows, & plenty of regular dining room tables. There are hanging lights and plants. Just gorgeous. I looked up some photos online and during the summer they have outdoor sidewalk seating. I ordered the avocado toast, which at first I felt buyers remorse cause it was $15 + tax... but it was incredible. The egg salad was delicious, my absolute favorite, and the guac itself was flavorful. It came with plantain chips which I dipped in the guac that fell off of the bread. I don't care much for radish so I just picked it off. The little cubes are queso fresco, which added a nice flavor and I personally love cheese. FYI avocado toast is only offered on the brunch and lunch menu - not dinner. In case anyone wanted to head over and try it. \n\nTo end this review... Short interactions with staff but everyone was pleasant. I absolutely want to come back here for dinner!",

The food was delicious and the service was great. \n\nWe tried the Lomo saltado ( beef stir fry, onions and tomatoes in a soy based authentic sauce over French fries)  along with the Pulpo Anticocheta (this octopus was perfectly tender with great seasoning) Their ceviche was fantastic as well. We also ordered causa (basically a cold potato dish in their amazing yellow aji sauce. You have the option to add shrimp or vegetables or nothing as you please. 100% recommend the causa. Even though it's still a smaller limited menu, the options were great and fairly priced. \n\nThe classic pisco sour was good, a bit too sweet for my liking though. Their margarita was the winner of the night though, it was perfect! \n\nParking was easy, there's a covered parking deck connected to the building or street parking.",

The dishes are mostly seafood but Tio Luchos does offer pork and beef options with a handful of vegetarian starters. \n\nSo far I have eaten the pork belly and smoked trout bowl. The pork belly was really good but I should have split the meal-it was very rich and I had a food hangover the next day. The smoked trout bowl was fine and may have been the least creative option on the menu. \n\nThe menu at Tio Luchos is tasteful and demonstrates a careful appreciation for what they serve. At the time I dined at Tio Luchos the seafood entree options were largely shellfish base dishes; which of course limits the entree options available to those who are not into shells. There are ceviche options but I balked at the opportunity when my server said the Leche de Tigre is very spicy. \n\nMy favorite part about Tio Luchos is the atmosphere they are able to create. The low lighting and electric pop music fits well with the open kitchen and seemingly foreign dishes. I'm not sure I will ever fully explore the depths of Peruvian cuisine but Tio Luchos can at least make it a little less unknown.",

However, we called the previous night to make a reservation, but were told reservations weren't necessary. Yet when we got there, we were told there were no tables available, and we'd have to sit at either the bar or outside, and there was a high chance of rain. I'm not sure why they couldn't simply give a reservation, but if you call asking for one and they tell you that you won't need it, insist that you get one regardless.\n\nThankfully, the food made up for this hiccup. We order the papas fritas which are fries and it came with a spicy dipping sauce and tajin, and I ordered the ceviche de pescado which was DELICIOUS. It was so fresh and acidic, eating it was almost addictive. For drink, I order the passion fruit mezcal drink which was good, but the flavor of passion fruit didn't come out much due to the strength of the mezcal.\n\nFor dessert, I also recommend the cheesecake!",

I had the Ceviche Mixto and the flavors just popped in my mouth; my favorite tip is putting a bit of all the ingredients on the plantain chips so you can taste it all at once! The ceviche had a little bit of a kick but I really appreciated that because I love spicy food. Would 10/10 return again to try something new! The service was good, they made sure to check in from time to time. Overall, the ambiance of the restaurant was great! I loved how much greenery it had!",

We went to the bar area and was super busy with all the people ordering, but after a few minutes we were able to order pisco sours. Then someone left and we were able to get a chair at the bar so we ordered ceviche mixto and it was delicious. We got the chocolate dessert with the ice cream that was perfectly proportioned. We also got ch\u00edllanos which were very refreshing. There was a DJ outside playing peruvian music which was awesome, I will certainly go back to try other dishes.",

                "text": "First time visiting this very new Peruvian restaurant in the heart of Virginia Highlands. My Peruvian fianc\u00e9 and I regularly travel outside of the city for a good dish, so we are happy to see the Peru culture make its way downtown. \n\nOur first impressions were: beautiful interior, nice vibey restaurant, somewhere you could easily go hang out with friends, have some drinks and appetizers. Food was great and tasted very fresh. Portion size was good. We would recommend an appetizer if you're really hungry. \n\nService was very attentive, at times too attentive, but we went on a Thursday evening just before the dinner rush arrived. It seemed like they were just staying prepared for a busy night. At 7:30pm it definitely started to pick up. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 & I shared the Ceviche Pescado and Lomo Saltado. The presentation was very nice. Only feedback I would give is for more sauce on both dishes because it was so good! (and who doesn't love a good sauce?) I am also used to having a Lomo Saltado steak prepared in strips vs. the large cubes but I can appreciate the chef giving their own take on it.\n\nDeck Parking is validated by the restaurant (saved us $5 for 2 hours) which took a huge stress out of sorting parking in the city. This goes a long way for me.\n\nWe will definitely be back. The waiter said the menu will change monthly/seasonally as they cycle through some items, and other traditional dishes will remain permanent. \n\nExcited and hopeful for this restaurant to succeed! I strongly recommend giving it a try!!",

The ambiance is nice, they play a lot of Latin and Spanish music which is cool. The ceviche is really good but again, lacking a bit in the amount of fish it has. The steak dish with fries as well had limited meat but the sauces in everything were delicious and the meat that was there was super tasty. The chaufa also had limited fish in it. The drinks were solid tho, I asked them to throw some passion fruit in my pisco sour which was perfect.",

                "text": "I've been waiting to try Tio Lucho's since learning that a contemporary Peruvian restaurant was coming to this increasingly vibrant food block of the Poncey Highland neighborhood--and I can happily say it was worth the wait! So good! \n\nParking: validated parking (2 hours) is available in the parking deck at the rear. Just bring your ticket with you to validate in the restaurant.\n\nAmbience & Seating: the space has a modern, fun, but laid-back atmosphere, and on a Friday evening when we stopped by, the crowd was a good mix of young and old--but generally more hip. There are high top seats available at the full bar, limited patio seating, and a decent amount of indoor tables. However, due to the modest size of the dining room, I'd recommend making a reservation if you have a larger party but small to medium sized groups should be fine. We came for a Friday date night and had no problem snagging a patio table on a beautiful evening! \n\nService: really friendly, helpful, and attentive! \n\nDrinks: we started with drinks, ordering the Pisco Sour ($15) and the Passion Mezcalita ($15). The Pisco Sour was fantastic and even decorated with a subtle Peruvian flag on top. I was also very excited to see they had Chicha Morada on the menu (iykyk)! I didn't get it this time, but it gave me fond flashbacks of my Peruvian college roommate who LOVED her some purple corn juice! Definitely ordering that next time, especially since theirs is made in-house! \n\nFood: another lesson my Peruvian roommate taught me was you do not skip out on Peruvian ceviche, and the Ceviche de Mixto ($28) was a clear example why *chef's kiss*! Delicate slices of snapper, Georgia shrimp, and octopus marinated in leche de tigre (\"tiger's milk\": a citrus based ceviche marinade--this one made with rocoto pepper for a spicy kick) served with sweet potato, cancha corn, onions, and fried plantain chips perfect for scooping up bites of ceviche!  It was sooo good! Next, we got the Fish Collars ($24) and Lomo Saltado ($28). I haven't had much fish collar before, but this was so flavorful and tender, I would definitely order it again! The Lomo Saltado was also very good and a great option if you prefer a non-seafood dish, but I preferred the other two dishes we had a little better. Another note about the menu was the variety of options to see different palates and dietary restrictions. We have a number of family members and friends who are vegetarian or pescatarian, so I love to keep an eye out on restaurants that provide a little bit of something for everyone, and this is now certainly one of them! \n\nOverall, we had a really great experience at Tio Lucho's from the service to the drinks and food! The prices are a little higher than, say, your standard Peruvian mom and pop establishment OTP, but I would argue it accounts for the elevated level of food quality, presentation, and service received.\n\nWe will definitely be back soon to try more of their rotating / seasonal menu! Highly recommend!",

Everything was fresh, delicious and portioned out perfectly. Tito our waiter did an amazing job explaining the menu to us and suggested great options for the vegetarian at the table. Will definitely suggest this spot to friends and excited to come back for happy hour and try their brunch!! Great to have a solid ATL spot where the food and reviews actually line up.",
