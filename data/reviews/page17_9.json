        "text": "I was visiting some friends and work colleagues in Georgia and I was suggested to try this spot. Safe to say that I absolutely LOVE bartaco. The service, ambiance and food quality are all amazing. I think I've referred about 6 couples here as a dinner date option. \n\nIt was dinner rush so the host put our party on the waitlist for ~ 30 minutes. Got a text and seated around ~20 minutes. Super friendly and introduced us to our friendly waitress. She was quick to get us some waters and utensils and did not hover over us while we browsed the menu.\n\nThey have a large variety of meat selection and the salsas are amazingly fresh! I wish I able to get a photo of our meals before devouring them. \n\nI would definitely hope this restaurant goes quickly and they come to California to open one because they would do some amazingly here.",

This is located in a very cute part of Atlanta and one of my favorite locations.\n\nI ordered the watermelon margarita and chips w/ guac to start. The guacamole was amazing and the drink recommendation was perfect.\n\nI ended up getting two baha fish tacos and one shrimp taco. The shrimp taco was just ok and had a slightly bland taste to it, but the fish tacos were absolutely delicious and I highly recommend it.\n\nThe servers here are sooo friendly and made sure we were enjoying are time there.\n\nI would definitely check out this spot if your ever in the area.",

        "text": "This quarantine is no joke but atleast we can still order our fave tacos and bowls from Bartaco! My husband and I would normally go out to eat on the weekends pre-covid so this past weekend was no exception and we did Bartaco Take Out! Our experience was phenomenal:\n\n- Ordered over the phone and the girl on the other end was so kind and friendly. It feels nice to hear another person's voice now a days, amiright?\n- Food was ready when we arrived with a little smiley face drawn next to our name. How sweet!\n- Margaritas to-go? Heck yea! Bartaco is doing \"Margarita Kits\" that come with their freshly squeezed Margarita mix of limes and oranges, salt for the rim, and limes for garnish. All you need at home is tequila and you're set to have a good time. The kit makes 4 margaritas for $8.\n- The flavors of everything was just as we remember it to be. With so any aspects of our lives changing it's comforting to taste something that reminds us of what Normal is. \n\nThanks Bartaco for being open during these times. I'm sure you need us now more than ever and I hope this review will encourage folks to order takeout!",

I suggest you order a side of beans and side of rice to add to your taco to enhance the experience of the taste(just my opinion). The tacos are small so order two of them as an equivalent to one standard size taco. The menu with the QR code was different and very convenient. I'll most definitely recommend this as a place to try while in the Midtown Atlanta area.",

Although I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal, this hit the spot especially after two amazing tacos. The prices were great- $2.50-3 for ea. \nIt had great vibes for a date night or small party of friends- dimly lit and chill. \nI loved my tacos- i tried the spicy chorizo and the duck. The meats were cooked so well with great seasoning and flavor. \nI enjoyed the way you ordered- you tally off how many of each menu item you want, and the waitstaff collects it for you once you've jotted it down. Usually one paper = one check but they put it all on the same bill so Id advise to remind them before paying how you want to do it.\n\nWill definitely come again to try out more of the tacos AND desserts!!",

They used to make homemade churros but now they sell the frozen kind that you can get at grocery and heat up yourself. \n\nI ordered the family meal $50 bucks for a family of four. Okay, makes 16 small tacos. Great deal, yeah not from here.  $70 dollars worth of food later and they gave me more sauce than chicken. If you look at their website photos you will see what the meat is supposed to come in, but not for me they gave me a single portion of chicken in a take away in a box.

Breaded shrimp that a good taste to it. \n\nRoasted Duck taco was freaking awesome! My favorite!! I've had it other Bartacos but they just seem like they prepare their food even. After than other locations. I dig it! \n\nGrilled corn on the cobb is always amazing. Has cotija, lime and cayenne on it. So so good. Couldn't eat it on a date night because it gets all in your teeth. Then again, might be worth it. Lol\n\nGreat atmosphere. This was my first time to this location. Super cute place for a date night!

We needed to ask for things (water, refills, ordering) and the food did not all come out at the same time, but besides that there were no problems. \n\nAppetizers:\nGuac + roja + verde\n\nI thought the guac was very good and the other two sauces were tasty but not exceptional. The chips were fantastic, but we had to ask for more to finish the sauces. \n\nTacos: \nChicken Chorizo\nMy favorite of the tacos I got. The flavor of the chicken and the sauce worked really well together. \n\nMojo Pork Carnitas\nThe pork was good but left a slightly greasy after feel. \n\nMushroom\nGreat option for vegetarian people. The mushrooms were nicely seasoned and cooked. \n\nCarne Asada\nOf the 4 tacos this one was my least favorite. Nothing really popped out. \n\nDessert:\nChurros\n\nThe flavor was sweet and eggy and they had a nice crunchy exterior with a fluffy interior. The chocolate dipping sauce was dark but complimented the sugary churros well. \n\nI would give it 5 stars but I'm picky about having to repeatedly ask for things such as water, and I only liked 3/4 tacos. If you are a big sauce person, ask for extra sauce on the side because they don't give a lot.",

        "text": "Love love love bar taco. Service at this location is a hit or miss- usually it's absolutely stellar but like most restaurants there are a few servers that make you contemplate coming back. They've implemented a new virtual ordering system that still has a few kinks, especially for larger parties. Basically, your entire party scans a QR to download a menu and then you all order under the same tab. In order to place any orders, you have to link a credit card and then when paying, you can split the tab from your phone. In theory, it sounds great but when you have multiple people ordering multiple things, it gets messy super easily. So be warned but the good tacos should make up for any ordering confusion",

        "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience here! I've been lamenting a lack of a good taco spot that offers vegetarian options, but this might be my new go-to. The mushroom tacos here are SO good, definitely get them if you're a mushroom lover. The cauliflower taco was okay, it could've used more of the sauce--but the sauce was also just spicy, it didn't have much flavor to it besides that. Note the tacos are small and bite-sized, so if you normally eat two you might end up getting four here. Get the reviver if you like a refreshing drink, it was excellent, one of the best I've had. The chips are interesting because they come as whole crispy tortillas that you break off yourself. The guac and the esquites (off the cob corn) were solid as well. I really loved their contactless ordering & payment system, I think more restaurants should adopt that. We ended with the churros and they were also some of the best churros I've ever had--they were warm and surprisingly authentic, and served with a little side of chocolate sauce that wasn't too sweet. The one thing that kind of bothered me was that the service slowed down considerably near the end of our visit--which is ironic because we showed up during the dinner rush, and service was very quick then, but near 9pm we struggled to get a hold of any servers and had to wait much longer to get our second round of tacos and had to call the manager (Ashley) over to check on the churros for us. She was truly wonderful though!",

We asked to be seated outside and were seated immediately! The seating was on the front patio with a view of the street and side view of the outdoor fireplace. Our server was really nice and made us aware of tapas which we love. What was extremely convenient but savvy was the digital menu ordering app. Pretty easy to add to your tab too. We ordered a pineapple margaritas, fish tacos, duck, shrimp bowl with street corn. All very delicious at an affordable price. This one is definitely on my list of Atl foodie finds.",

Everything is still order and pay by QR code which I really like, nobody really bothers you unless you put the little card up to signal they need service. I couldn't find street parking but there's a parking garage right behind it, I think I paid $7 for about an hour which is kind of steep but if you get lucky, street parking is free. It's also located in a really nice area so you can walk around if you're waiting for a table or to walk off the meal. The duck tacos are absolutely to die for. I love how simple but balanced they are, and whatever broth they come in is something I would drink. Keelah was awesome! She was very attentive and even recommended the duck birria to me which I didn't know they had since I hadn't been in so long. Thanks for the hookup, they were amazing!! Definitely will be back, the midtown location is much closer to me but this location is worth the extra minutes!",

I ordered rock shrimp tacos & a spicy cucumber salad. I love the ordering process (for food). Individual order, where you just write the quantity beside the food items you want. Easy! \n\nWe didn't wait too long for our food to arrive & I loved the presentation. Metal trays, with thin, brown paper lining. The tacos were AMAZING. Love the grilled, corn tortilla & the shrimp were a good size. The spicy cucumber salad was spicy, but oh so delicious. The cilantro really kicked it up a notch!\n\nVery cozy space.

We had to wait at least 40 mins just to get seated and it was at 10pm on a Friday. \n\nThe first time I went to Bartaco I was a little skeptical I'd like it. I'm usually pretty particular about the way my tacos are made but everything here is soooo good. My favorite taco is the pork belly one hands down. I also loved their corn on the cob, but I usually tell them to take it off the cob so it's less messy. Tuna tatake is really good too. And if you like mojitos, theirs is theeee best I've had! I usually like to add a flavor to it, but this one didn't need it. \n\nI definitely recommend this place if you haven't been!! You won't regret it, I promise! :)",

Everything was great from the 2 tacos to the street corn to the sweet plantains. I ordered a margarita that was tasty but can't remember the name. The ambiance was perfect for summer time dining. We were inside but it felt like outside due to the entire left side being open so we were exposed to the outdoor seating area as well. \n\nThe ordering process was unique in that it's all on your phone. Scan the QR code, place your order online then pay with your card. It allows you to add things to your order without doing a brand new transaction if you do so within a certain time frame. They do bring things out at random so for example you may get your side of corn beside your tacos or luck you & have them at the same time, it just depends. I think that's the style of the place tho.  Definitely a chic, community vibe though so no one in our party was pressed to get anything in any particular order. I enjoyed!",

We forgot to bring our parking ticket to get it validated. Parking is $6.50 no matter how long you park with each additional hour $1/hr added on top. I like the experiment, and this is the cleanest and most westernized sushi restaurant I have been to.

Let me emphasize...the margaritas are great and made with freshly squeezed lime juice and what ever fruit they have for the day. I come here pretty often and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Some of my favorite tacos are the pork belly (slightly sweet touch), Baja fish, and the portobello. You have to order the guacamole as an appetizer because it's fresh and seasoned perfectly. I have also tried the roasted chicken and the chicken soup. Both are bigger portions if you looking for more food. \n\nThey validate parking in the Inman Quarter parking garage or you can always grind street parking. \n\nThey are a cashless restaurant.",

Please reach out to me directly prior to your next visit as I would like to treat you to a few of my favorite tacos and a dessert on us. You can reach me via email jbarber@bartaco.com. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.",

There's a big lot with plenty of space and validaTeD parking. I came in on a Friday around  lunchtime and didn't have to waIt! Bartaco has a range of veggie friendly tacos on their menu which I greatly appreciate. I generally go for three which fills me up! I also love the salsa assortments they have ready on the table. The server we had was very attentive and accommodating, and the  manager stopped by the table to check in which I always appreciate!",

After waiting almost an hour, still no text, so I walk in to pick up an order and am standing under the large TAKE OUT sign. I'm waiting about 5 minutes and finally get someone's attention. \n\n\"Oh, carry out is now at the bar in the middle\"\n\"But you have a giant sign right here.\"\nSILENCE. Certainly no apology\n\nNo one at the bar. I search for my order, which includes a bottle of water. How am I supposed to know it's not a twist off? \n\nGo to bartaco if you want rude service, cold tacos, and a drink you can't open.",

The carne asda tacos were my second favorite, so well seasoned and tasty! Also get the plantains, they've got a hint of salt on them that just pairs well with the sweetness of the plantain!",
