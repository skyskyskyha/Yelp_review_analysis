Ask for Amy if you are coming in, she is very thoughtful and courteous. Everything is delicious and combinations are well thought out by the cook staff. Most main dishes come with a bright salad as a side which is great to contrast some of the heavier dishes. \n\nMost haves: the Korean Queso and Guacamole dips - crispy wonton chips were delicious to scoop both of these\nCrispy potatoes - these are topped with Parmesan, parsley, and some green onions\nFrittata - you will get a made-to-order personal frittata as opposed to a slice of an already cooked one. The added Boursin cheese made it super fluffy and soft. Note: it comes with the side salad on top because it is best eaten together but feel free to get it on the side too",

        "text": "When Whiskey Bird first opened, we lived down the street and honestly thought it was good, but not great. When Morningside Kitchen closed, we tried it again and were much more impressed.\n\nThen we went for brunch. Oh my. Their fried chicken bubble waffle is just plain spectacular, with the right hints of spiciness to balance out the sweetness. It's so good that we've tried in vain to find a substitute now that we live in Chicago, a surprise because Chicago has so many amazing restaurants. We had occasion to be back in Atlanta recently, and not to put too fine a point on it the spots we made it a priority to hit were Bacchanalia and Lazy Betty for dinner - and Whiskey Bird for brunch.  Fortunately Whiskey Bird did not disappoint. Hopefully Michelin covers them for their next guide update. I think they deserve a Bib Gourmand personally, at least for brunch.",

        "text": "Whiskey Bird is a fun, modern restaurant  serving new American fare with Asian influence!\n\nAs a group of 6, we ordered two apps for the table -- no small plates here! We had the roasted cauliflower which was smothered in gouda fondue, a dish which can obviously do no wrong. My one criticism was that it was a bit hard to divide and conquer without getting super messy. \n\nWe also shared the brussels sprouts, which as other reviewers mentioned are a must. Not too sweet, extra crispy, and lots of umami from the bonito flakes! They served the bacon on the side to accommodate a vegetarian in our group, which was appreciated.\n\nFor my main, I ordered the bourbon glazed grilled salmon which came on top a sweet potato hash with miso caramelized onions, chinese broccoli, and chinese sausages. The salmon was fine but the sausages were crispy little bombs of flavor -- totally unexpected! \n\nLastly, we got the hummingbird cake for dessert as a recommendation from the waiter. It's their signature dessert. I liked it but wouldn't get it again -- I personally didn't think it was that great? But I'm also not big on pecans?\n\nWhiskey Bird is reliably good, which makes it a great choice for a date night or parents visiting! They've got a big patio, a trendy (but not pretentious!) open-concept indoor space, and excellent service that makes you feel welcomed! I would recommend :)",

Our server was very friendly and helpful, especially when we were being annoying and couldn't figure out what we wanted to eat and drink. LOL.\n\nFor food, we decided on the Crispy Brussels, Bao Benedict, and both the chicken & tuna Gyoza Tacos. OMG the brussels are a must-order. They might be some of the best ones that I have ever tried, and the fried egg on top was just *chef's kiss*. My friend and I each switched out one of our tacos so that we got to sample both, and surprisingly, I preferred the chicken taco over tuna. The Bao Benedict was good, though it was probably my least favorite out of the options that we tried. We love Bloody Marys and prefer tequila... so their Bloody Maria with jalapeno infused tequila was right up my alley. It was good, not too spicy, and I enjoyed the seasoned salt rim.\n\nIt's a great spot in Virginia Highlands, and I'm sure we will be back soon.",

It was the brunch hour which it seems they are known for, and the reservation system showed booked.  We took our chances and popped in anyhow.\nthey had a breakfast bar to sit at with FCFS seating so we were glad to grab two spots. It was actually a great spot with big morning windows along side us and a server right there with a ready and a sunny disposition.  \nShe had waters over to us quickly and a few good tips on what to order too.  I got their eggs benedict per her recommendation and my gal got their breakfast burrito.\nBoth were pretty good.  I wasn't a fan of the Benedict but I appreciated what they did with it, original.\nMeanwhile the ambiance and service was excellent.  Being from out of town, it really was enjoyable to see how nice the people of ATL were.  \nThere's good chance we will be back soon.",

        "text": "Finally made it to this spot! It's been on my list for years believe it or not. Myself and a few friends had brunch here on a Sunday. Parking was great as there's a lot across the street. We made reservations online and was immediately seated. We ordered a few different entrees and appetizers with my favorite being the potatoes and Brussels!! The potatoes and Brussels were everything!!! The chicken with the chicken and waffles was a lil under seasoned but the waffle was cute and had good flavor, kind of thin. The steak was also a little under seasoned but was juicy and tender. \n-1 star for lack of seasoning on entrees and -1 star for mimosas. \n\nThe frose was good and had a kick to it. The mimosas was rather dark but the tequila cocktail was strong as well. \n\nOur server was super friendly and I'm glad I finally made it. Not sure if I'll be back. If I do, it'll be for the Brussel and potatoes and to try other appetizers.",

It is fairly enclosed and safe from the elements. They had fans going, and I believe they have heaters during the winter. We checked in with the hostess at the front, and she had us walk around to the backside to meet her on the patio.\n\nWe happened to stop by at happy hour which is on Sundays and Tuesday-Thursdays from 5-6:30pm. They have discounted drinks and bites, which was nice. We tried the following items, and enjoyed them all:\n\n- Okonomiyaki fries \n- gyoza tacos with peruvian chicken, salsa verde, cotjia cheese (comes with 2 small tacos)\n- popcorn chicken with WB & Korean bbq dipping sauces\n- WB chopped salad \n\nMy husband ordered the Bourbon-spiked Arnold Palmer, and I had the frose and the special frozen drink, which was a lavender Paloma.

        "text": "Came on a Saturday afternoon w/ my friend for an early dinner! I enjoyed the atmosphere and food, plus the service was super fast and responsive. If you can, ask for (Weston? His name starts with a W, lol) but he was great! Made great recommendations based on our likes/dislikes and was extremely attentive & prompt. \n\nParking:\nYou are able to parallel park right outside of the restaurant and my friend said they have their own lot, but the way I came and my lack of parallel parking skills resulted in me parking in the lot right across the street which was free of charge and had plenty of space! So, if you come and there are spots open over there I recommend doing that as well! \n\nAtmosphere:\nWalking in, it was pretty empty but the seats at the bar were just about full. Seems like they had a good system going as far as to-go orders and I saw quite a few people coming to pick-up at their pick-up window. With it being pretty empty inside, the interior looked a little more like industrial than expected like with exposed roof piping in some areas but white/modern looking in others.. it definitely has cute character to it. The outside patio area was the star of the show for us with the small tables, brown benches, and wicker decorations. It was a hot day, but it was definitely shaded and controlled enough where we weren't hot or uncomfortable while dining which was a plus. \n\nVibes:\nVery good place for intimate conversation with friends, a date, or even a business meeting. I don't recall hearing any background music, but if there was any it was VERY subtle. Do know this place is honestly very casual, the table next to us waiting on their to-go order brought their adorable dog with them (PETS ALLOWED, THEY BROUGHT THE DOG A BOTTLE OF WATER). \n\nDrinks:\nBoth my friend and I ordered Rose 75. It had a very strong taste of grapefruit and stayed carbonated for quite a long time. I'm not the biggest fan of citrus drinks and prefer my drinks very sweet, so this was just eh to me. I'm not a huge fan of brown but it seemed as though their more interesting drinks included whiskey or bourbon so plenty to choose from if that's your speed! \n\nFood:\nFor an appetizer we had the Crispy Brussels and they were a 10/10 for me! My friend and I were both a little weary of the inclusion of the egg, but our waiter was right in telling us to mix it in. The Brussels were truly crispy, there was enough bacon, sauce, etc.. I want to drive back over there right now just thinking about them  Definitely the highlight of the night for me! I'd also like to try the gyoza tacos! \n\nFor an entree I had the tuna poke bowl. I forgot to ask them to hold the edamame since I'm not a fan, but the other ingredients were very refreshing and played well together. The bowl even included sliced radish, which I never had and found to be a nice touch! Can't remember the sauce they provided but it was very salty like a soy sauce and if you have any knowledge of sushi or sauces I am definitely an eel/teriyaki sauce sort of girl so I wish there was more of a sweet element or sweet sauce provided with the dish! \n\nWe didn't order dessert but they did give us complimentary strawberry Pocky sticks after we closed out our bill! Super cute touch. \n\nPrice: \nEverything is MORE than reasonably priced for the portion size! I had SO much food left-over that I wish I could've taken with me if I was going straight home! \n\nAll in all, I'd go back and recommend it to those who enjoy Asian-fusion!

Very healthy eating options and I feel like this embodied the true definition of Asian Fusion.\n\nTo start I ordered the rose 75 to drink. This was very good and refreshing. Tasted like wine and grapefruit which I didn't mind. My friend however wasn't too big of a fan of this. I asked for the sweetest drink and our waitress suggested this. \n\nWe also ordered the Brussels sprouts which I was nervous about, I've had bad experiences with Brussels sprouts but this was sooo good. The toppings really pulled everything together--especially the bacon and the sunny side up egg. I would definitely order this again.\n\nI ordered the ahi tuna and this wasn't my favorite meal, but it was good. It is very vegetable heavy so it's probably good for my vegetarian/pescatarian option. It was a little dry and I let our waiter know and he brought back some WB sauce which helped alot so I'd suggest the same!\n\nOverall I'd come back again. I'd like to try their brunch!",

        "text": "This place is such a vibe! There is a front patio (I believe a back patio as well), it has an open concept kitchen, and it's immediately inviting. There is easily accessible (free) street parking around the front and back, which is a huge perk. We were able to come around happy hour on a Friday without a res and were seated quickly. Our server, Maya, was INCREDIBLE. She was so fun, had the best reccs, and we really just wanted to be her friend irl (sadly she's no longer there!). They usually have two frozen drink options - frosé and a special -- I got the creamsicle. It was so yummy with a good balance of orange and vanilla and very strong, made with vodka, 10/10. We got a few apps and meal to share (5 people). Apps we tried: crispy Brussels (perfectly crispy, savory with a little sweet, 9/10) and the dip duo (fresh guac, Korean queso, and wonton chips, YUM 8/10). The Thai steak and noodle salad was refreshing with so many fresh flavors, perfectly cooked medium rare steak, and pops of fresh mint leaves, 9/10! The bourbon glazed salmon was not too sweet, cooked well, moist, and flaky, complimented well with the sweet potatoes and sausage which had plenty of sauce, 8/10. The seared ahi tuna was also yummy, but had only a few pieces of ahi tuna (I believe 5, as we each got a small piece), served with what I believe was a seaweed salad, very well flavored, 7/10. \n\nOverall, I was so impressed with this place and will absolutely be back. Perfect girls night, happy hour, hang out spot!",

My friend and I came in after a long night and she treated us so well (bringing us lemon & salt for our water without asking, continually checking on us). Food was amazing. Started with chips & guac/queso. We were expecting the average order of chips & guac but these were AMAZING. The wonton chips were unique but so flavorful, in addition to the queso and guac. Seasoned so well. I got vegetarian breakfast burrito and my friend got the bao benedict. Both were amazing. Portions were large, had to take to-go boxes. \n\nWere seated on outdoor porch but it was screened in and had heat lamps. Very comfortable. \n\nThis is my third time at Whiskey Bird and I'll be back for sure!!!",

        "text": "Came for a Friday night dinner, overall this lands as a low 4 star for me, right on the edge of if I'd come back or just enjoy it as a one time try.\n\nFood is the big one, they had some unique offerings and overall it was quality. \nThe whole cauliflower is a sight to see! It's cooked and seasoned well, the only caution is it is a hefty portion, we ended up with about a quarter left splitting it between 4.\n\nThe chicken sandwich app was the clear winner for me, I ordered a second as a savory dessert. The chicken is crispy and juicy, the bun though is the unique spin which makes it. Would suggest getting a side of the spicy Korean bbq and dipping!\n\nTacos were ok, true shell was crunchy and unique though the chicken in the middle was a bit more of a mush like slow cooker chicken. Flavor was ok.\n\nThe crispy rice bites were nice though very small for the price.\n\nStuck rice in any of the dishes was great and the poke bowl was fresh and flavorful. \n\nThe skewers were fun and quite a variety, the main knock here would be the sauces seemed to blend together and not highlight the meat or veggie enough.\n\nThe space was ok, we sat on the patio and had a space for 4 tucked back in a corner. Service was also just ok, potentially a new person but wasn't what I'd look for in a 5 star stop.",

Both the chicken gyoza tacos and tuna gyoza tacos were so good that we ordered them again. The flavor was to die for and the tacos were full. The sliders were just as good and again, our table ordered another.\n\nHowever things went downhill when the entrees came. The chicken burrito was okay, but lacked flavor. The steak and eggs were dreadful. The steak was over cooked and the eggs had the weirdest texture ever. We couldn't tell if they were mashed potatoes or potato salad when they first came out. The taste was so mushy and the eggs were unseasoned. The chicken and waffles were okay, but nothing to rave about. If seemed like the overall consensus was a lack of flavor, so maybe they were just having an off day. Even though the appetizers were bomb, I don't think I would come back here",

There is parking in the back also. \n\nI ordered the frosé and it was tasty but strong. We ordered the dip duo and ahi tuna tacos as the appetizers. The dip duo had amazing queso and it was definitely the preference. The wonton chips with it were a great pairing. The guac was also good but next to the queso it didn't compare. The ahi tuna tacos were also so tasty. It comes with two in a serving but I did think one is pretty filling.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is great especially outside during nice weather. Definitely recommend.",

The blue-green color palette made me feel calm and happy. \n\nIf you want to make a reservation Whiskey Bird is on Resy, but we got here at 5:30 on a Wednesday and we're immediately seated. \n\nI began my evening with a rose 75. It has pink gin, fresh grapefruit, and bubbles.  My next drink was a Manhattan which is on their regular cocktail menu. I really appreciate that the cocktail menu has a picture of the glassware the drink will be served in next to the cocktails ingredients. \n\nMy first course was the tuna tataki and it was on the happy hour menu in January 2022. It melted in my mouth. I was being Ketoish so I had the Caesar salad for my meal. I loved the pickled jalapeños. \n\nI will be back as there are so many items on all of their menus I want to taste.",

A few friends and I opted to check out Whisky Bird at 5pm for Happy Hour on a Wednesday. I was able to make reservations in the morning for 5pm for a table for 3. \n\nI arrived a few minutes prior to 5pm and I was able to parallel park directly in front of the restaurant-- SCORE!!  Upon walking in we were immediately seated at a booth. I do believe we were the first patrons for the night. \n\nOur waitress was so friendly and  was very familiar with the menu. She offered detailed descriptions of drinks and food. She also made sure the our water glasses were always full. She  was engaging, courteous, service oriented. And simply put- AMAZING! \n\nI ordered the Okonomoiyaki fries and the tuna tataki. One of my friends ordered a cocktail and the katsu Sando, and my other friend ordered the chicken tacos off the happy hour menu and an entree salad. I also ordered a dessert ( a brûlée that was a special for the night) . When I tell you that each of us enjoyed every bite of our food. Everything was cooked fresh and had an amazing taste! I am already trying to plan my next visit so that I can try other menu items. \n\nIn addition to this place having good food and service, the decor is cute! It's a nice place for a cute Instagram photo! Last, but not least, each of us were given a complimentary small pack of Pocky chocolate! SCORE again! \n\nGo ahead- make that reservation, or just stop in if you are in the neighborhood!",

They have indoor and outdoor seating available. The outdoor seating was spacious and there were heat lamps available although we didn't need that because it was 70 degrees. \n\nParis was our server and she was bomb! Like one of the best servers I've had in a long time. She was extremely detailed and attentive. When we arrived, she detailed every drink on the brunch menu and made them all sound so delicious. It was impossible to say no. I ended up with a drink that wasn't on the menu, the Gingerbread frozen. It was yummy and was just the right amount of boozy. Others in the group got the frose and the rose 75. And everyone had great things to say.\n\nLet's get into this food! We had the brussel sprouts and chip duo to start. Brussel sprouts are a must! Amazing flavor and delicious. The dip duo was good and I love some wonton chips. For entree I got the crispy grouper sandwich. It was a 10/10. Perfectly fried and seasoned and the coleslaw on the sandwich was also good. Others in the group got the chicken and waffles and four egg frittata. My bro said the chicken and waffles were aight. Nothing major to write home about. You typically think of chicken and waffles as a heavy dish and they make theirs with bubble waffles so it turns out to be really light. My sis loved the egg frittata. \n\nAlso scooped up a key lime pie for my dad and he loved it. Said it was the best he's had in awhile. I can't wait to return and try more dishes. Paris said they have good happy hour and dinner menus too!",

After searching for a brunch destination I was perturbed at most restaurants menus & prices. I have to mention that this place is extremely moderately priced imho. We were seated on the front patio out of the sun with a gorgeous breeze. Our drinks, a whiskey sour & mimosa were average at best but we throughly enjoyed our food. The dip duo was served with both guac & a cheese sauce with house made chips. Our second choice were the crispy Brussels which were indeed delicious. It's worth noting that the sizes of these appetizers are humongous. My wife & I were extremely full after those alone yet we decided to try the gyoza tacos with chicken which were ok & indeed small.",

We had the Peruvian chicken tacos which was absolutely delicious, so good we ordered it twice and I didn't even get a picture of any of the meal. I also got the salmon as my main even though I almost full off the appetizers alone. Highly recommend and will be back.",
