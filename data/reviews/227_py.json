When I tell you my pregnant self waited over an hour to order a burger and some fries, I did, and I WILL DO IT AGAIN! LOL!\n\nIf you're sensitive to particular or possibly vulgar words, this place isn't for you but the food is amazing! I've never had a vegan burger taste this good! And the fries were shockingly amazing as well. Normally these types of places miss on the fries but no, Pinky Cole didn't miss with this! The food was fulfilling and I was stuffed! My mother in law didn't finish her burger because it was so filling and she got full fast. She enjoyed her burger as well! \n\nThe brand is GENIUS! From the music outside, to the \"friendly\" customers, to the food, the brand is impeccable like the food!\n\nGo! Wait and go! You can order online if you don't want to wait in line because there's a line. DEFINITELY will be going back!",

Nothing seemed freshly cooked and the veggies kind of overpowered the taste of the burger. Not sure if the Pattie's are thinner/smaller, but it seemed different that the first time I tried a year ago at the location by MLK's house. Everything was hot and fresh. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian and I really liked the burger before. Maybe it was an off day. But, I probably won't visit this location again. :(. \n\nAlso, they have that system where they ask for a tip before you make the food. I hate that! How can I tip if I haven't eaten the food or even seen if there was a mistake made. Then they stare at you to see if you're going to tip. It's not a tip, it's like a bribe for them not to eff up the food you paid for!!!",

A energetic fun spot to grab some of the best burgers in town-Togo. My go-to is the One Night Stand Burger, plant based patty loaded with vegan bacon & veggies. The Ambience was okay. The cashier effortlessly checked us out. We had all the condiments needed for our burgers. Oh and try their yummy Slutty Lemonade & Sweet potato pie! Go check Slutty Vegan out!

We were so excited we ate it in the car in a parking lot nearby lol. \n\nI can't wait to one day have Slutty Vegan again! I'm so glad I was able to finally try this spot and will recommend it to everyone who I know that visits Atlanta. \n\nVegan/vegetarian or not .....

I also purchased a sweet potato pie that was yummy! This location is small but the vibe and music while waiting inside and outside was cool. The wait time was over what I thought it would be (30 mins) but definitely was worth it!",

They have some items for sale in the waiting area. The person who took our order was cool with us, but it seems like the next person was given an attitude when he asked for extra fries not sure what that was all about but I found it was unnecessary.\n\nNo parking lot, we found street parking around the back on the residential street.",

It's similar to the Hussy Fussy, which was the first burger I had at Slutty Vegan, but has vegan bacon on it instead of pickles. The vegan bacon made a big difference so now it's a favorite! As always the slutty fries are amazing! The slutty dust seasoning takes the fries to another level! You really don't need anything on it as it is sooooo good by itself. The banana pudding was okay but I feel like it's hard to create a vegan version so expectations can only be so high. Looking forward to visiting again whether in ATL or another one of their locations.",

                "text": "I don't recommend eating here. The quality is not up to standards.This vegan restaurant has wandering roaches everywhere I looked. The service is also poor, and the prices are high considering they have a known Roach infestation, it is unacceptable. \n\nYes, the female employee said while processing my return, \"We are handling the roaches (baby Roach dead on the counter by the register smh) Every restaurant in this area has roaches.\" I said this is a health code violation . \" She stated we are handling the roaches. I understand why you want your money back. \n\n The atmosphere was unpleasant, and the restaurant was understaffed. Overall, the experience was very disappointing.  \n\nCalling customers sluts upon entry is slander and defamation of character.\n\nDefamation of character is a tort that occurs when a person makes a statement that causes another person to be ridiculed, embarrassed, or held in contempt. In this case, the restaurant's staff made a negative comment about a customer's character, which constitutes defamation of character. \n\nWhat is slander ? Slander is a false statement that is spoken or published which causes damage to a third party's reputation, and is a type of defamation. The restaurant's staff's comment was false and damaging to the customer's reputation, making it a form of slander.\n\nName calling such as \"bitch\", \"whore\" , \"slut\"  is sexual harrassment and establishes hostile work environment. According to the office of equal opportunity, \n\n Sexual harassment is a form of discrimination that is illegal in the workplace and it includes any unwanted verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Name calling is a form of verbal abuse that is intended to humiliate (customers) or intimidate someone, and it is considered a form of sexual harassment.\n\nPossibilities : Any restaurant was understaffed, which could mean that the staff IS not able to keep up with cleaning and maintaining the restaurant. This lack of cleanliness can lead to many issues, including roaches, which can harm humans. \n\n What are roaches ? Roaches are a type of insect that is usually found in damp and dark areas. They are known to carry bacteria and other germs, and can cause allergies and asthma attacks. They can also cause structural damage to buildings and contaminate food.\n\n Again : Roaches also cause a variety of health issues, including asthma and allergies. Therefore, if your company knows roaches infest on its premises, you could not be liable for lawsuits \n\nMy honest notion, rebrand and stop slandering customers and respect them and get rid of the roaches. This company makes a significant amount of cash flow to temporary close to treat and handle roaches properly. Otherwise they become household (restaurant) pets?\n\nThis is not to shame a black owned business. \nHonest review.",

It was absolutely delicious The crinkle fries are sprinkled with their slut dust. I also tried the vegan sweet potato pie. It was very flavorful and tasty. The workers are friendly and energetic. Just a warning, if you're hypersensitive then they may get a slut shout-out. The sandwiches have unique names like sloppy toppy, menage a trois, fussy hussy, and super slut. This particular location is only set up for takeout. You can also order ahead and pick up.",

                "text": "So I've been to Atlanta several times in the past few years, and I've always forgotten to stop by one of the locations to try it out and see what the hype was all about. I finally made it this past weekend and I wasn't necessarily disappointed, and would recommend it. However, I have a few caveats regarding the location I went too. \n\n1. For starters, I wasn't too comfortable being called a \"slut\" as I entered the building and neither were the mature ladies that came in behind me. \n\n2. My bill was $50+ for 5 items and two of the items were water. And speaking of water, they sold it as slut water on the menu but when I received them, they were your basic Smart water looking plastic containers that you can get anywhere. See pictures below. How about a \"slut water\" label? \n\n3. Although the food, especially the burger was delicious , it looked nothing like the menu burger for $18. \n\n4. The burger and the shrimp were pretty saucy, referred too as \"slut sauce\", so I was concerned I'd regret it later on with an upset stomach. Fortunately my stomach was able to tolerate it, but my passenger was unhappy with the amount of gas it produced if you know what I mean.  \n\n5. This particular location was on the corner of some gentrified neighborhood so there was minimal parking and I could see the residents unhappy with folks parking in front of their homes to walk up the street for fast Vegan food. *My suggestion* either minimize the amount of locations you are opening which will help justify the \"limited edition\" prices. And / Or place them in black communities so your at least not only \"giving back\" to the community from which y'all have come from, and maybe even combat some of the chain fast Food restaurants and liquor stores that are hurting the black communities health wise. \n\n6. According to the Slutty Vegan website, they pride themselves in being black/woman owned. I can appreciate that, knowing there aren't enough black business owners in America in the food industry. But limiting it to black women only minimizes it's potential I feel. As a black man, I immediately thought of 2 locations where this Slutty Vegan idea would prosper. But I'm not a woman so the ideas will have to remain internal. \u200d\n\n7. I read that Slutty Vegan uses \"impossible burgers\" which is concerning because the meat is made from genetically engineered soy protein and genetically engineered yeast called heme which bleeds, and banned in Europe.  Not too mention, impossible meats is founded and owned by Patrick O. Brown which is sorta contradictory too their prideful slogan of being \"Black Woman\" owned. Patrick Brown is a white man. *My Suggestion* Seek out a black woman or man at one of the prominent culinary art schools here in American and create your own vegan burger and shrimp recipes. And with the fries, seek out a Black investor with some land and grow your own potatoes and produce. \"Food deserts\" are a real thing. Some one like Tyler Perry whom is in Georgia already with lots of land and $$$ who would probably be happy to contribute. \n\n8. Lastly, I was visiting from 2 states over, there were no souvenirs being sold at this location; like t-shirts or hats that I could bring back. Disappointing and lost sales opportunities.\n\nAs I stated earlier, the food was delicious, the water was regular though, but I would still recommend everyone should try it at least once if your near any of their locations. I would actually go again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I can get all the ingredients particularly the impossible meats and water from Whole Foods for under $50.",

I do understand with the location, but I will say the food had great seasoning. I brought a friend who wanted to get a taste, and for the amount of time we waited on our food it wasn't hot. The service was acceptable for the time of night we came, but they weren't as vocal with their slutty greetings. They were intentional in giving us a wait time while we waited for our food and handling the customers professionally while we awaited our food. I loved the design of the location and it's perfect for a photo whenever you come to get Slutty! I had the super slit and I loved the flavors of guac and Jalape\u00f1o. You can't miss me with fries, but be cautious that you are charged more for sweet potatoes. I believe they're called side heauxs. Either way, I'll be back for another round at another time for the vibe.",

                "text": "As I ate my Slutty Vegan burgers and chicken sandwich, I kept thinking in my head how do they make plant-based, vegan beef, bacon, chicken, and cheese taste so \"authentic\" and good? If someone had purchased Slutty Vegan's burgers for me and didn't tell me they were vegan, I'm not sure I'd have been able to tell the difference. However, I probably *would* have been able to tell with the chicken sandwich because of the \"chicken's\" texture. It was noticeably different from standard chicken sandwich filet meat, with a more uniform, spongy consistency. That said, I still thought Slutty Vegan's chicken sandwich was satisfying and I'd order it again.\n\nSlutty Vegan started out as a food truck in August 2018. The business specializes in vegan fast food. More specifically, they specialize in fast-food-style vegan burgers and sandwiches.\n\nThey opened their first brick-and-mortar location (this location) on Ralph David Abernathy Blvd in the Westview neighborhood of southwest Atlanta in January 2019. Since then, they've opened two additional metro Atlanta locations in Jonesboro (July 2020), south of the city, and on Edgewood Ave in Old Fourth Ward (October 2020). At the time of writing this review, a fourth Atlanta-area location is on the way.\n\nSlutty Vegan is popular. Long lines for the food truck and outside the restaurants are a common sight. For this original location on Ralph David Abernathy, the inside of the restaurant is very small so most customers have to wait outside. This helps make the line out the door appear long.\n\nWhen I posted pictures of my Slutty Vegan meal on social media, multiple people asked me how long my wait was. When I arrived around 6:10pm on a Wednesday, after it had just stopped raining, there were only two people in front of me (and one of them had already placed his order and was just picking up). I think I got lucky.\n\nThe restaurant doesn't have dedicated parking, but street parking around the restaurant is free. This is a tiny place with no indoor nor outdoor seating. It's takeout-only, which was fortuitous when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. There's one way in and one way out. They had both doors propped open during my visit to maximize ventilation. If you didn't wear a mask, you couldn't enter. They sprayed hand sanitizer into every customer's hands upon entry. One register, one pickup counter.\n\nSlutty Vegan's menu offerings can change daily so be sure to check their Instagram feed for the current day's menus: https://www.instagram.com/sluttyveganatl/.\n\nWhen I visited, there were six burgers priced at $13-15 each. I noticed the online menu, which showed their full lineup (11 burgers, sandwiches, and a plant-based bratwurst), had slightly more expensive prices for some items. For example, in person, both the Sloppy Toppy and Fussy Hussy were $13 each, but the online menu showed them at $15 each.\n\nHere's what I got:\n\n* One Night Stand ($15) - plant-based patty loaded with vegan bacon, vegan cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato, and Slutty Vegan's Slut Sauce on a vegan Hawaiian bun\n* Super Slut ($15) - plant-based patty loaded with guacamole, jalape\u00f1os, vegan cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato, and Slutty Vegan's Slut Sauce on a vegan Hawaiian bun\n* Chik'N Head ($15) - plant-based chicken tossed in buffalo sauce topped with pickles, vegan ranch and coleslaw on a vegan Hawaiian bun\n* Skinny Dippers ($6) - NOLA-style fried pickles with blackberry mayo sauce\n* Slutty Fries (one cup of fries was included with each burger) - French fries with signature Slut Dust\n\nFirst, they forgot my blackberry mayo sauce that was supposed to come with the Skinny Dippers. That was disappointing. I was looking forward to trying it.\n\nIn general, the food was yummy. The burgers and chicken sandwich tasted just like regular fast food; the beef more so than the chicken. While the vegan bacon in the One Night Stand didn't have the same crispy texture as real bacon, it definitely had that familiar smoky flavor and then some. I was surprised. As is typical with fast food chains, the burgers/sandwich didn't look as good in real life as they did online, but that was OK because they tasted satisfying. The Skinny Dippers were among the best fried pickles I've had, though salty like the rest.\n\nThe restaurant has a fun atmosphere. When I was there, the friendly cashier Julianne B announced each customer and where they were from over the loudspeaker. The music was turned up like In Da Club. Inside, there's only enough room to stand in line. There's an open kitchen so you can watch the staff prepare burgers while you wait.\n\nI placed my order at 6:15pm and was in my car and driving off by 6:27pm, so the turnaround time was reasonable. Along with the orders of the people physically in front of me, the kitchen was working on online orders as well.\n\nTL;DR - I think Slutty Vegan is worth it if you've never tried it before. It's unique and tasty. For me, I'd never had vegan fast food like this before until now.",

                "text": "Slutty Vegan ATL is an extremely famous Vegan burger joint known for its delicious plant-based burgers! They have over 351K followers on Instagram and they are known for being a hip take-out joint without the usage of any meat! Slutty Vegan does not have any dine-in options, and you should always expect a line at Slutty Vegan! \n\nWe came on a rainy day so the line wasn't that bad, but apparently it can be as bad as 60+ minutes, so it' always important to plan accordingly! Our wait was fortunately only around 20 minutes. \n\nOnce you reach the front of the line, you are able to see some Slutty Vegan merchandise, such as Slutty Strips--which are vegan bacon that can be purchased.\n\nWe decided to order \n\"One Night Stand\"\n\"Chick'N Head\" \n..which all come with a side from fries!\nUpon ordering, we were invited into the restaurant to see how these plant-based burgers were being cooked!\n\nOne Night Stand - \"Plant-based patty loaded with vegan bacon, vegan cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato, and our Slut Sauce on a vegan Hawaiian bun\" // This seems to be their signature burger, so we decided to get it. Upon our first bite, I seriously looked at the burger and I said \"this isn't meat?!\" It tasted like a hamburger from Five Guys or something. The patty was so tender and juicy, and the bacon tasted just like meat as well. I was actually extremely impressed with the burger and it really hit the spot! The vegan cheese also tasted just like cheese... Man how the world has changed.. Even vegetarians and vegans can enjoy a burger now! On the other hand...\n\nChik'N Head - \"Plant-based chicken tossed in buffalo sauced topped with pickles, vegan ranch and cole slaw on a vegan Hawaiian bun\" // We wanted to try something different besides the typical hamburger, so we were debating between Heaux Boy (vegan shrimp burger) and chick'n head, but unfortunately, they did not have Heaux Boy on the menu. I personally do not recommend this burger. The chicken texture isn't as tender and real like a plant-based patty. It kinda had a rubbery texture and the chicken patty was extremely peppery. It didn't taste bad, but it did not exactly have the authentic chicken feel to it. While it was mildly disappointing, the flavor of the burger was still pretty decent!\nThe fries did not disappoint either, and it the \"slut dust\" which seems like their signature seasoning also complimented the fries very well!\n\nOverall, Slutty Vegan ATL was definitely a special experience. Will I be back? Hell yeah. I want to try the other burgers on the menu as well as the Heaux Boy! Hopefully, the texture won't be as bad as the vegan chicken. I am looking forward to it. I know many of you guys want to check out Slutty Vegan, and I DEFINITELY think you should check it out! It's really worth visiting!!!",
