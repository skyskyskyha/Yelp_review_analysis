I wanted to gift myself with the Fogo de Chao experience. This restaurant has a health score of a 100 which is always a bonus for me. The staff is adhering to CDC's rules and guidelines. Each server and hostess was wearing a mask and this location primary takes reservations on the weekday and weekends. There is valet parking on the premise as well.\nI made a reservation and waited for about 10 minutes before me and my party was seated. The server was great and he made some really good suggestions. The FOOD was unbelievable good. So good I thought I would cry, quality cuts without needing additional seasoning or steak sauces. I got their passion cocktail and it was great. This place has like an upscale buffet style. So many sides, fruits and roasted vegetables to choose from. Whenever I'm feeling fancy and want to treat myself I'll come back to Fogo.",

They have self and valet parking so you have a choice on how you arrive.\n\nI recommend getting their lunch special which includes the salad bar and all you can eat meat. We feasted on absolutely everything - rib eye, lamb, filet mignon, and much more - to the point there was no way I was going to be able to go back to the office because I needed a huge nap.

        "text": "Have heard alot about this place and finally decided to give it a shot when I realized it was close to the hotel i was staying at. Its a very busy spot and even though i had a reservation I still had to wait about 10 minutes before i was seated. I came here mainly for the picanha but it was nice to be able to try a bit of everything. In my opinion with these Brazilian steakhouses its always a good idea to go minimal on the salad bar and go strait for meat to get the best bang for your buck. The food was delicious but I was a bit disappointed that I kept getting skipped over when the waiters came around with the meats. I brought it up to one of the managers however and that was quickly corrected. Wine selection was very good, but the ones on happy hour were not available. Would've been a 5 star if it wasn't for those things.",

We were mistaken. \nFirst off I called because on Google it said the dress code was \"business casual\". I was told jeans were okay as long as they weren't ripped and couldn't wear athletic shoes. We get dressed up to go there to ensure there's not an issue and there's people there with shorts/Athletic Shoes/Athletic Clothing/ripped jeans/do-rags/Athletic team hats.....that was the start of the ruined experience. Waitress was slow in responding to giving us refills and for spending $240 with the tip for 3 people the meat selections weren't near the 15 they advertise on their menu. We won't be back if we ever have to pay for it ourselves.",

They come around to the tables with different kinds of meats and different preparations, such as steak, lamb, pork, chicken, sausage, etc. When it is busy you have to keep an eye out on the ones you want and it's OK to ask questions.\n\nMy only complaint is there wasn't much parking but that's typical of a downtown area.",

We waited with a slew of other reservations, until 7:05 to be seated.  What happened to the reservation?  The entire waiting area was wall to wall people, minimal bar service, management coming up but not looking ANY guests in the face.  We were told we were next but then saw 3 other large groups go by: one of 7, 8 and 9. I asked about those and they said no, you are next for a table of 6- well then I wasn't next was I. so they honored later reservations with the exact seating- that is ridiculous. I heard people saying they were short staffed- then why were they so overbooked?  Just to take the money?  \nWe were sat in a back corner-I didn't mind that- but we did not receive the same gaucho service. The table server was great, but the gauchos were repeatedly asked to come by, by us and the server, and 45 mins had gone by before we saw anything but the same 3 cuts of meat.  Beyond disappointing. I emailed corporate- and still no response.",

By 9:10pm we had not been seated. We went to the bar to get a drink while we waited and ended up waiting nearly 35 min for 7 drinks. We assumed they were short staffed it was Saturday night so we expected to be busy hence the reservation but the drinks were rushed and made horribly. When my boss asked for a remake they refused. She asked for the manager and Brian came over. I have to say I have never heard a manager speak to a customer in the manner he chose to address her. He was rude and dismissive. It was absolutely obnoxious. I am in customer service and was so disgusted with the service. On top of this, the entire wait staff was running by us and kept cussing about the customers they were helping in the restaurant. Needless to say we left and did not dine there. Worst ATL experience yet. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND NEVER GO HERE. So many other great options for food in this city.",

When I return to this restaurant, I hope he's our server.\n\nThe hostesses were very friendly as well.\n\nFood:.  The meat cuts were delicious. The cold bar was impressive. The only thing I can say is that it's a little different from other Brazilian steakhouses that I've been to. I am used to a hot bar as well as a cold bar. I did have some mashed potatoes, polenta sticks, sweet plantains biscuits and two sauces at the table. In my area there's usually a variety of hot dishes.   My favorite black bean stew was a little disappointing.  I found the beans and the sauce we're a little too thin for my liking. I could not recall if there was any type of sausage in it either. But that was probably my only complaint.",

I was so excited to eat, being that it was my first time there, I forgot to take any pictures but I would recommend this restaurant for sure.

He gave us great recommendations and did not rush us out the door! The food was excellent, we had the Waygu ribeye, and it melted in our mouths, really amazing! This was an extraordinary occasion, and the service was beyond our expectations. The host has something to be desired as we arrive seven minutes early with an empty restaurant and they would not seat us until our reservation time; even sat us later than that. But the service from our server made up for all of that! We couldn't be happier! Thank you for making our anniversary so special!",

So, we went online and switched the reservation for what was available on online. We were then told that we would have to make a reservations for at least one hour out. Where is this posted online? Or in the description on Open Table? But, it was our fault we went to the wrong restaurant. So, we asked to be placed on the waiting list. We were then told there wasnt one. So... I can request to be seated in 30 minutes, but I cant be put on a waiting list? Hhhmmm\n\nI called and asked to speak to a manager who asked me \"Why didnt I go to the Dunwoody location?\"\nAfter a frustrating conversation, I was told I could be put on a waiting list. This angered us as we told her at the desk that we would wait! The manager then proceeded to tell me the wait jumped from 1hr to 2hr within 30 seconds. Lol This is a joke.

Enjoyed the items brought to our table, the sides and meats, but didn't find the buffet to be anything special. The wagyu ribeye was delicious and by far the best meat. We had to send the seafood tower back, it was so over cooked that the crab could not be separated from the claw, everything soooo chewy. Yuck! Might go back just for a wagyu ribeye, we'll see.",

When you think of all you can eat you do not think of this bc nothing comes close to this. They are NOT cheap with the meat or the sides for that matter. As long as your coaster is turned to keep it coming it keeps coming and this isn't any cheap tough me, it's great quality meat that's well seasoned and full of flavor. To top it off it'd reasonably priced. Worth every penny and to be honest would've paid more. I'm already thinking of whose birthday is next so I have another reason to come not that a reason is needed. Also It's Happy hour there everyday all day.",

        "text": "This was the worst experience I've ever had at fogo de chao. My family from out of town loves to eat here when they are in from out of town. We eat here about 5 times a year and either eat at the Atlanta or Dunwoody location. This was the absolute worst service and experience we had ever had. We had a 1 o'clock reservation for a group of 5, we arrived at 12:45 and were asked to sit in the waiting area by the bar. We were seated by 12:55 but had to wait for over 10 min until a server became available, the man that walked us to the table tried to make conversation but it was an uncomfortable more then 10 minutes for everyone while we waited on our server. Once seated we ordered drinks and helped out selves to the market table and which was not being refilled multiple things were empty for most of our meal and not being refilled. 4/5 of the people in our group got the meat experience and had their cards flipped to green. The server brought water but did not bring additional drinks we ordered wine and sweet tea until we had already finished a couple plates of food. Within 20 minutes of sitting down no meat had come by. We had to ask multiple times for them to bring meat by. There were several servers who would come out with fresh meat serve two people at a table and then run back into kitchen. We asked our server several times for specific cuts of meat, and they never came. There was literally nothing more we could of done other than asking our server over and over and the meat never coming. We were kinda done and they came by and cleared our dirty plates, we were still waiting on a specific cut of meat ribeye and the grilled cheese which we told the server this but they never brought new plates and the meat and cheese never came . It was such a disappointing visit and for $200+ there are so many better restaurants in Atlanta. We will not be back anytime soon if ever.",
