        "text": "Dined at Boccalupo for the first time on a Saturday and realized right away just how popular this spot is! We snagged a last minute Resy cancellation, but throughout the night the bar (which is first-come first-serve) had clusters of people waiting for open seats or who were waiting for a table as one of the restaurant's limited walk-in parties for the night. The atmosphere was intimate and cozy. \n\nWe first got a rundown of their cocktail list by our server Abby (who was amazing!). They purposely keep their cocktail list a bit secretive, with just vague descriptions of each drink to not disclose what's actually in each one. They do this so it's more of a conversation between the servers and guests - guests can ask about drinks that seem intriguing to get more info, which was a fun touch to the menu. \n\nFor food, we ordered the spicy meatball appetizer, the black spaghetti and carbonara pastas, and the cookies and white chocolate gelato for dessert. Everything was delicious! The black spaghetti is one of Boccalupo's signature dishes, with shrimp and spicy sausage, and it did not disappoint. Would highly recommend this spot (and a reservation)!",

Arrived close to 6:30 on a Saturday night and easily grabbed a seat at the bar. Fantastic service by the bartender who offered both a la carte and a tasting menu. \n\nFood:\nA-16 Spicy meatballs with ricotta, frico, and garlic crostini - recommended by a new friend at the bar AND the bartender. Absolutely did not let down. Every bite was lovely with a nice hint of heat at the end. The crostini was perfection as well. (5/5)\n\nPan fried fusilli w greens and cheese - simple but extremely well executed. Flavors were beautiful and this joined my clean plate club easily. The texture was amazing with the crunch from the pan fry and the softness of the cheese. (4.8/5)\n\nEnded with coffee gelato served with a warm and huge pizelle cookie. I was stuffed at this point but had no issues finishing this up. That's how good it was. (5/5)\n\nAbsolutely lovely dinner that was only surpassed by the friendly staff and patrons.",

        "text": "4 stars for a really solid Italian restaurant.\n\nMy wife and I decided to check out Boccalupo, located over on Edgewood, one night based on some recommendations from friends. We could have sat outside because there was plenty of outside seating, but decided to sit inside and have the full Italian experience. The bar inside was pretty poppin' and concerned me about being able to get good service, but fortunately the waitress we had (who was also playing hostess half of the time) was on top of her game and ready to help us with anything we need.\n\nMy wife decided to put in an order for various items while I decided to go with the tasting menu to give us good balance. The first item we had come out was the fried oyster starter. While it didn't blow us away, it was a fun little dish with a nice Italian twist on fried oysters.\n\nAfter waiting for a little bit, we then moved on to several items. The first was this item I will describe as a salad but had some sweet crunchies on top that made it pretty fun. We also had the famous black spaghetti come out, which was a really solid dish that I was glad to try but also glad wasn't my full meal, as well as a meat dish that my wife ordered and liked.\n\nWhat really stood out about this night was our central dish: the carolina gold and corn risotto with tomato and duck. This dish was quite large and absolutely delicious! The picture makes it look like quite a mess of a dish (and tbf it could be plated a little better), but it was a really unique and tasty dish that I would order again and again. We grabbed our dessert soon after and headed out into the night with happy and full bellys.\n\nOverall, BoccaLupo provided us with a solid Italian experience that really had some unique takes on dishes. I could definitely see grabbing some more food and wine here out on the patio in the future.",

Jason came out and immediately introduced us to two of their specialty cocktails - delicious!  \n\nWe then sat in Zoe's section and we have voted her the best server in Atlanta!  Not only is she extremely friendly and knowledgeable, but very attentive.\n\nThere isn't an item on their menu that we haven't loved.... We live a few blocks away and we consider ourselves lucky.  \n\nIt is hard to get in, but often times you can check Resy the day of and they may have open tables last minute.  Run don't walk!

I'm not sure if there is a parking lot but there is plenty of street parking. \n\nWe had reservations and were seated as soon as we arrived. Our waitress was really nice and knowledgeable about the menu. It wasn't as busy at first but did pick up as we were leaving. (It was a Friday night)\n\nThe cocktails were really good and you could definitely taste the alcohol. Although the drinks were pretty small, everything else was on point. \n\nThe food was really good, so amazing. I recommend getting the Gem Salad. They also have a nice wine selection as well but I didn't get a chance to try. \n\nWill definitely return here again, so good.",

        "text": "HAD TO GO AFTER ALL THE HYPE AND SOMEWHAT LET DOWN\n\nso if you know, boccalupo is a top Italian restaurant in Atlanta, making it a hard reservation to get. luckily, i landed a reservation and made my way out. surprisingly, the parking wasnt bad at all, which is uncommon for the inman park area. there's plenty of parking behind the building, as well as street parking which was fairly empty on a Wednesday night. \n\nthe restaurant itself is cute - it somewhat reminds me of a house and isn't too fancy at all. the indoor area is nice, and it has an outdoor/indoor area with garage style windows (they were closed and had large fans blasting the space). \n\nmoving on to the food... we started with the Marinated Mussels with Aioli, Cucumber Brodo & Drunken Bruschetta. for some reason, i thought they were going to be a more traditional dish with tons of mussels in a white wine sauce, but i should have paid attention to the description a little bit more. however, they were good - had a ton of herbs, nice clams, and a thick piece of bread soaking up the sauce. \n\nthe pasta dishes we got (listed from favorite to least favorite):\n- Chicken liver Ravioli with Green Tomato Marmellata, Lady Peas & Herbs: this dish surprised me a lot. i feel like it's a risky dish because not a lot of people are big fans of chicken liver, but it was great. the chicken liver was nice, and the toppings paired perfectly with the ravioli. \n- Baked Eggplant Parm with Marinated Peppers, Mint & Mozzarella: an interesting take on eggplant parm. a little bit lighter than the traditional version and had tons of vegetables in it. the eggplant did seem to get lost with all of the other toppings but still a solid option.\n- Black Spaghetti with Hot Calabrese Sausage, Red Shrimp & Scallions: seemed to be a favorite among other yelpers, but not my favorite dish. i don't think I'm a big fan of the dish in general, but to me, this one wasn't the best. the calabrese sausage was a little too minced for me and was very dry. i know the dish isn't supposed to be saucy, but it needed some sort of pizzaz added to it. \n\noverall, i was kind of let down, especially with the amount of people hyping it up. all of the ingredients were very fresh, which you could taste, and i liked that the pasta was freshly made. additionally, the service wasn't the best either. i asked the waitress for some recommendations on dishes and she wasn't helpful at all. \n\nmaybe i got the wrong things, but i wasn't too impressed after my initial visit. id definitely love to come back and try some other dishes and give it another shot!",

I had the Aperol Spritz and she had a Margarita with ginger beer. \n\nWe had the mussels and meatball appetizers. Mussels were not in shell as you'd think. They were on top of crostinis and very fresh. Meatballs were a good size and spicy, but not overly!  I had the southern fried chicken parm with collards. I cannot begin to explain how divine this tasted. The white sauce with the collards interlaced with the fusilli was the star in my opinion. The chicken was tender and the red sauce was good. The portion could feed you twice, easily. \n\nMy friend had the chicken ravioli which tasted strangely sweet and fresh at the same time. This portion is just enough for the meal. \n\nFor dessert she had the panna cotta and I had the chocolate mezzata (pictured). Both were huge serving sizes. Great evening!!",

Probably not. \n\nI started off with their Personal Jesus cocktail both times and it is fabulous (they can explain what's in it). The meatball appetizer explodes with flavor - got that both times as well. I have had both the Carbonara (not always on the menu) and the Spicy Black Spaghetti (always on the menu). The Carbonara was rich creamy perfection. The Black Spaghetti is definitely spicy. They warned me and set proper expectations so it was all good. The heat sneaks up and comes on gradually. The problem is, the dish is so savory and loaded with shrimp that it is hard to stop until your face is sweating. \n\nThey have their own Gelato machine so save room. If you have been to Italy, that memory will come back to life with your first taste (so said my wife over the Pistachio gelato). Cookies are perfect for me - crisp candied edges, gooey inside. Great Ying and Yang for the vanilla gelato. Yum! \n\nService is impeccable! Great vibe, not a big place, book in advance, good parking around back.",

The cauliflower is always stellar and I  despise  cauliflower . This stuff is so good. Try it. You won't regret it. \n\nFor my entree I had the chicken parm pasta. This is a YAASSSSS. The waitress said this is their largest entree, so if you are famished, this is the dish for you. I only ate half. Creamy collards? Who woulda thought?! I hope this stays on the menu. It  was just so stellar. The chicken was moist and perfectly fried - not too much breading. \n\nI also had the latte. It's just a latte I guess but man it was great, too. \n\nWe also had the cookie dessert. It came with 2 cookies. Some chocolate cookie and a snickerdoodle. They looked hard, but they were both very soft.  \n\nService is attentive attentive. \n\nThe covered patio is great for the Covid era. \n\nWe came at 6:30 on a Saturday night, and all 3 people in our party were able to park in their lot. \n\nDuring Covid, there's a 2 hour limit for parties of 3+, but no one was obnoxious about reminding us or rushing us.",

        "text": "Enormous disappointment. I'll start the review by stating I grew up in Bologna, and have eaten the best pasta Italy can offer. So I was very excited to try this place. I ordered the pappardelle bolognese which is a signature dish. It was way overcooked, with a enough sauce for 4 dishes. I was presented with a mound of an under salted attempt at bolognese ragù with some overcooked pasted drowning underneath. It was by far the worst execution of the signature dish from Bologna I've ever tasted. The food is stomachevole, which in Italian means nauseating. If you decide to give it a try, then in bocca al lupo, (which is the correct phrase) which means good luck. The restaurant is basically a very hip expensive Olive Garden. \nChe schifezza.",

        "text": "Woooow!!! Now, this is some fantastic Italian food! We came here because my husband received a gift card from someone who said it was their favorite restaurant. We thought we have nothing to lose since our meal was paid for. We made reservations (which is a must!) and headed over. We were immediately greeted and seated and the vibe of the place is just a vibe, I don't know another way of putting this. \n\nOur service for the evening was wonderful as our waiter was very attentive and did an amazing job of explaining the meals to us. Service was definitely 10/10.\n\nLet's talk about the food and drinks, shall we? For my drink, I ordered the Italian Trading Co. and this is one of the best drinks I have ever had!! It was the right amount of sweetness, tartness, and spiciness, that I love in a drink. Now they don't give you much, so I ordered two but dang it was so good! Side note: I don't drink much so my range of great drinks is limited :-)    \n\nFor my meal, I order the Pappardelle Bolognese, which many reviewers suggested and my hubby got the Chicken Parmesan. My meal was so scrumptious and did not need any salt. For those who don't like salt or seasoning, this is definitely not the dish for you, because I did NOT have to add anything to this meal! My husband's meal was great also, which would be the perfect meal for someone who loves flavor but not as much saltiness. \n\nOverall, I would love to return with my friends in the near future because their food and drinks have been calling me to come back!",

So the Chef doesn't like to out source anything. So he would rather just disappoint his patrons and (I heard several people request bread) !\nI'm Italian from NY & Philly . Never have I heard such a thing!\nHe changed the traditional way to make Pasta Putenesca & form me it fell totally short . Hardly enough sauce , too much chopped up stuff & no bread. \nThe mushroom Salad w escarole was totally lost under the balsamic vinegar . I can go on a little more here but I will stop!\nI love the atmosphere there & I use to love the food . I don't think he is trying to appeal to a real Italian crowd . & I will be 1 less Italian going there!\nAdita",

Seeing Pictures of the black spaghetti is what drew me in initially. \n\nThe old fashioned I ordered was on point and delicious. The black spaghetti with hot calabrese sausage and red shrimp sounded awesome, but honestly wasn't that great to me. The pasta which is infused with squid ink was mushy and I didn't enjoy the flavor. The dessert deserves 5 stars alone. I can't remember the exact name, but it included cheesecake ganache and apples. It was seriously phenomenal! I would return solely to order it again, but they change their menu frequently and it hasn't been listed.\n\nThe service was good and prompt.

        "text": "I continue to be impressed with the new age pasta houses that I find across Atlanta, and BoccaLupo deserves their acclaim. \n\nStar 1: How was the Service and Atmosphere?\n\nReally great atmosphere here at BoccaLupo with fantastic service to match. Even towards the tail end of these covid restrictions we all felt safe and distanced at what was a super comfortable and quaint outdoor seating area. Star. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nReally reasonable prices across the board here at BoccaLupo with some of the flagship pasta dishes that can easily be shared ringing in right around $20.00 per plate. Star. \n\nStars 3 & 4: How was the food?\n\nThis was good stuff. The highlight was, without question, the spicy tuna crudo atop crispy rice, which was one of the best iterations of the dish that I can recall having to include those at top tier sushi spots across the country. What a dish. \n\nThe pasta was also very good, and in sampling the black spaghetti, the fettuccini and the kale spaghetti dish I was impressed although admittedly not as blown away as I was with the tuna crudo. Single Star. \n\nStar 5: Would you be excited to go back?\n\nDefinitely. Star.",

        "text": "All around 5 star experience at BoccaLupo - came for dinner on a Saturday night during my first time visiting Atlanta. Coming from NY where there is no shortage of good food, I can't say enough good things about the food and service. Brian was our waiter and he was the nicest and helped to check a few times on options for my friend who has a gluten allergy. I Started with the What are you, the police? cocktail which was so good and light! Then we did a few apps, as well as the pasta tasting menu, which we split amongst the two of us without gluten allergies. The sampler was great and I'd highly recommended if it's available. We also added two additional pastas - I didn't love the dumplings as much but the spicy pasta w seafood is a must get. My friend got the risotto with seafood, another must order, also recommended sharing as it's quite rich for a whole dish. Overall, the food, ambiance and service was excellent and will definitely be back. Thanks Brian and BoccaLupo team for a delicious and memorable",

        "text": "If you can find a reservation to Boca Lupo, snag it while you can!  We randomly stumbled upon an available table for a Tuesday dinner and saw that it was booked for the next 3 weeks! \n\nDefinitely ask your waitress/waiter if they have a tasting menu, it gives you a chance to try several dishes.  We ended up ordering the tasting menu, an appetizer and an entree and it was the perfect amount of food for the two of us! \n\nGrouper Ceviche: great way to start the meal, light and acidic, balanced with a smoky leek flavor, and a crunchy hominy bites.  Highly recommend this plate! \n\nCrab and artichoke risotto: since Bocca Lupo is well-known for their Italian dishes, we were extremely excited to try their modern take on risotto.  We were disappointed with this dish since the risotto seemed to be over cooked, almost mushy, we didn't seem to get much crab, and the flavors blended together.  Opt for a different dish! \n\nTasting Menu: \nBread with burrata: bread burrata and balsamic vinegar, you cannot go wrong with this mix! Love that they prepared the bread with a panini press with olive oil and had a great mix of texture, between the crunchy bread and the creamy burrata.  Highly recommend! \n\nSpaghetti diavolo with shrimp: this has a kick  to it! Definitely seemed like there was a heavy garlic taste to it, and the dish surprisingly reminded me of a spicy garlic sauce.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, not overdone.  This dish was okay, left me wanting more. \n\nDuck with crispy rice: the duck had a great crispy skin, which added to the textures on the plate.  The crispy rice reminded me of fried rice, and they even had their own version of a duck sauce on the side.  Enjoyed the Asian twist of this dish! \n\nCrostata with blueberries and strawberries with gelato: you can never go wrong by ending dinner or the night with gelato! I could eat the gelato alone every night, it is that amazing!  Definitely include all components into a single bite, the sweet and bitterness from the chocolate, acidity from the berries and the savory creaminess from the gelato made this a great way to end the meal. \n\nOverall, this meal was pretty great minus some hiccups with the food.  We definitely came in with high expectations and left wanting to come back to try their tried and true dishes next time.  The service is impeccable, Heather was great!! Music is slightly loud, but they have outdoor seating if you want to opt out of the loud music.",

        "text": "What a fabulous dinner here this past Thursday! My fiancé and I made a reservation a few weeks ago. We would have preferred to go on a Friday or Saturday, but those days get booked out quickly! So we went for a Thursday night date night! Our reservation was for 6:15. We got there around 6 to make sure we found parking okay. They have an awesome lot right out back that's super convenient! It's such a bummer when you go to a restaurant in ATL and have to hunt for parking. So this was a huge plus! We checked in at the host stand. They asked us to wait outside until 6:15 for our res which was fine. They offered to serve us some drinks in the meantime. We were seated and our waiter, Connor, came over to greet us quickly with water and a smile. Connor was awesome! I loved his vibe and his excitement about the food. He gave a great run down of their specials and was super patient. We went right for our entrees. We got the southern fried chicken parm and the lamb and goat cheese lasagna. We looked at the menu online before and it wasn't updated with the latest and greatest so there were more options than we expected! These pastas were big servings so it was plenty for us to split and take some home! Connor did say that some dishes aren't as big as others, but these were some on the larger side. Wow! These pastas were amazing! The chicken parm was so tasty. Again, a huge bowl of delicious, creamy pasta topped with saucy, cheesy chicken parm. The lasagna was maybe the star of the show though! I loved the flavor combo of the lamb plus the goat cheese! So tasty. This place is so worth the hype and so worth a visit. Great for a date night or a fancy girls night.",

        "text": "Boccalupo is an experience. \n\nWe, my partner and I, made a reservation one (1) month in advance of our dinner yesterday evening. The reservation was for four (4) people, and we arrived with only three (3). We were informed of the restaurant's policy to only seat full parties, we understood and accepted, opting to wait outside as we awaited the fourth person. \n\nApproximately eight (8) minutes into waiting, the host comes and tells us that we are going to miss our allotted reservation time and will have to be worked at some random point later in the evening. We ask if we can be seated, citing the 3/4s attendance of our party and preparedness in ordering for our missing friend. We were told, \"Dude, this place is a train. You've missed your station and now it's chugging along - you'll have to catch the next one.\".\n\nSo, the experience begins. \n\nOur party becomes whole, and we sit. The staff was kind enough to let us sit outside versus in the dimly lit, loud, and sub-freezing indoor seating. We are told we have to order everything at once, again we are, \"on a train\". \n\nThe waitress asked if we have dietary restrictions or allergies, we inform her two (2) of our party are vegetarian. I do not think our vegetarian friends had the pleasure of looking into the waitresses' eyes again. The waitress told the rest of the party, \"Well, at least you can enjoy...\". Que long explanation of how Italian food should not be restricted to only being Italian food and that is why the Italian American restaurant serves General Tso's Octopus and Kimichi infused pasta.\n\n Of the two (2) appetizers we ordered, it seems they boarded separate trains. There was a ten (10) minute gap between their arrivals - and neither was worth the wait. \n\nWe then wait forty-five (45) minutes for the second cart of the meal to arrive. My pasta had KIMCHI in it and was still flavorless. The black spaghetti was an unending, unrelenting, bowl of uniform spice.  By the third bite you wish the train would hit a wall and start pondering what if you were the person on the tracks in the fated trolley problem - would you find relief? \n\nWhile I respect creativity and cultivation of culture in a kitchen - this missed the mark. I allow the basis of the idea to fuse a multitude of food cultures together is daring and could be a successful venture - the execution of the meals lacked severely. Coupled with the strange sense of atmosphere and human interaction dynamics - I do not recommend... unless you like trains or experiences as defined here.",

We asked, very politely and pleasantly, if it was possible for the music to be turned down at all, and were told \"no\".   I will possibly order takeout or delivery from here in the future,  but I will never eat there in person again.  if you have any desire to converse with your dinner companions, don't eat there!",

        "text": "After a flight delay that placed me smack dab in the middle of rush hour traffic, I eliminated a restaurant I wanted to try located outside the core city of Atlanta. It was time for an alternative and BoccaLupo was my second choice. It still took an hour's drive, but the reward was a comfortable setting with stunning food. \n\nThe roasted Cauliflower was perfectly browned and the mix of tart and tangy flavors was exceptional. I had a hard choice picking an entree. So many vied for attention and I didn't have a hankering for anything in particular. After longer than I normally take, I selected the 20 Yoke Tagliatelle. The beauty here was the varied selection of mushrooms, each and every type perfectly prepared. How did they do that? Some surely must take more or less preparation time. Were they done individually? However it happens, this was special. The Panna Cotta dessert was equally tasty and a perfect bow on the meal. \n\nThis was a pleasant spot also. The space invites relaxation and the staff was warm. Loved the 50's era slanted windows at the front! Need some creative Italian cuisine in a cozy setting? Try BoccaLupo.",
