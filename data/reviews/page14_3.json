        "text": "I've got mixed feelings about the General Muir.  A group of about 8 of us came for dinner, although it was their pastries that won over the crowd of us.  Lemme 'splain\n\nWhen we walked into the General Muir, we were all seated quickly and the menu was explained to us before we placed our orders, and place them we did.  I ordered their burger stack ($12) which came with a side of fries.  \n\nThe burger stack had american cheese, onion, pickles and two beef patties.  The burger itself was just okay, not really juicy or flavorful and the fries were very crispy...almost hard and crunchy.  \n\nWithout what happened next, The General Muir would be, at best, 2 stars for me, but also when we walked in they allowed us to take a sample pastry in a 'gift bag' for free.  The next day I bit into their cheese danish pastry and omg this thing, at a day old, was freaking amazing!!  \n\nLocated right off of Clifton road, in the Emory Point shopping area, there's plenty of parking, although precious little of it is free.  There are a few exits out of this little area of stores though, so it's an easy access locale.\n\nSo i'm torn here because had I paid money for the cheese danish and had my experience in the morning, 5 stars for general....but because I had a dry burger for dinner, i'll have to give these guys 3 stars for now.\n\nLong story short, go here for their pastries.  They knock their bake goods out of the park.  For all other things, maybe be a bit skeptical.",

Now I love a good burger so when she mentioned she actually dreams about it I knew I had to be in for a treat! And a treat it definitely was!!\n\nThe Double Burger Stack was so juicy. It literally melted in your mouth. From the menu description I thought it was going to be a basic yet typical cheese burger. I was wrong. So simple but very well crafted. Who would've thunk Shaved onions, pickles and American cheese would complement this grade of meat so eloquently:)\n\nI also ordered the Pommes Frites for a side. These were not your regular French Fries (which are also on the menu) but a more upscale version for an extra dollar. They top them with herbs and the aioli is amazing!! \n\nNext time you go let me know what you think!!",

        "text": "1st the bagels were so very fresh and the fish, I had a platter with 3 kinda was all exceptional. I always love lox of every sort, there's was excellent. But my surprise favorite was the smoked trout salad. Took\nHome half my bagel and most of the perfect horseradish cream cheese so I could eat ALL the FISH. I had the lower east side platter. Highly recommend. My husband put together and ala carte bagel sandwich with a side of pastrami. The only reason not to get the fish is that it doesn't come with the house made pastrami. Salty, melt in your mouth, home run. Despite a sign at the front requesting patience for limited staff and longer wait times, we had none of that. The service was exceptional. We were there at 9am on Sunday. The atmosphere was very pleasant and calm snouts carry on a conversation. I only with I had ordered a rose' to go with my special Sunday breakfast. I thought of it too late.",

        "text": "You can find The General Muir at 1540 Avenue PlI'm, Ste B-230, Emory Point, Atlanta, GA 30329 in the heart of Emory Village. Parking is along the streets (a bit limited) or there are a few lots if you don't mind walking (I'd advise this as the area is quite busy).\n\n\nI had heard about The General Muir from a few friends and have been wanting to visit - unfortunately it's in a part of town where I don't frequent. I had an opportunity (wife out of town) and a craving for an exquisite burger in mind so made the Muir my destination one late afternoon. I had heard and read about the General Muir taking general menu queues from a traditional New York style Jewish deli so I had a specific image in mind at the outset. I was literally blown away by the interior of this place on arrival - much more upscale than any deli I've visited - this place would make an awesome date-night destination (but note that they do close by 9:00 PM during the week).\n\nThe place was winding down a bit when I arrived and I was asked if I'd like to be immediately seated at the bar - which I gladly did (doesn't make much sense sitting at a table) especially as I was able to observe the bar and staff. I don't know if all the bartenders are as skilled as the one that was in front of me - if so then this place is really special. There was a couple at the bar who ordered several classic specialty drinks and the bartender pulled all stops using chill, stir and garnishing techniques that would fulfill the pickiest of cocktail aficionados. It was quite entertaining and better than most of the dinner theaters I've attended.\n\nFor dinner I first ordered my favorite local craft, the wonderful Creature Comforts Tropicalia in my favorite form, draft. Looking over the rest of the menu I ordered what I came to the Muir to experience - the Pastrami Bacon Cheeseburger. Continuing to take its queues from the Jewish Deli, the bacon on this burger is actually thin sliced Pastrami crisped up to texture of bacon. The burger was served with American cheese, shaved Vidalia onion, b7b pickle slabs and traditional hand-cut fries (so they still have the skins on them). This plate was massive and quite filling - also delicious and one of the best burgers I've had in Atlanta, to me surpassing the acclaimed H&F burger.\n\nThe staff at the Muir was quite wonderful, checking on me frequently and speaking to me when they passed by my seat at the bar. Combine the service with the great food and bartending entertainment, and you have a winner all around. This was an awesome experience and I can't wait to go again to see if it can be repeated.",

I always feel awkward having to do that and have nowhere to wait without using up a seat of someone doing in. \n\nThe display case always looks amazing!  I just always think I know what I want (sesame bagel with horseradish dill schmear) but then I spy the cinnamon buns covered in vanilla bean looking frosting calling my name (like this LIIINNDDSSSAAYYY!!!!). What?!? Less than $4 for that huge delicious looking pastry. Why not?!?  Do I skimp on the bagel?!?  Nope!  I get both. The line moves quickly. The staff is super kind and helpful and friendly. Oh and they ask how your day is. Great, thanks!!\n\nWhile I wait for my food to be ready, which isn't long, I get to hang out at the communist table listening to others conversations, I mean making friends. \n\nParking in the garage is free, but out front there are 15 minutes spots that are always taken so I pay the $1 for 30 minutes so that the next person gets 20 free minutes. Did I say that the wait for my food isn't long?!?\n\nI don't eat meat, so I'm not sure I will be dining here anytime soon during other meal times, but if I did, this would be my place. \n\nIf only they had half sour pickles and pickled green tomatoes- I would be so all about it!!",

        "text": "I had an incredible experience at The General Muir and will definitely be coming back. So I saw the restaurant on \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" on the Food network and had to try it eventually. So when in town I jumped at the chance. \n\nThe service: The hostess welcomed us and sat us quickly in the beautiful main seating room. It is definitely what I would consider upscale so wear some nice clothes given the chance.  Our waitress was pleasant as well, and knew not to come and check way too often, but kept our waters filled so A+ on service. Also when we left we got a free Baguette that they had made fresh in the morning.\n\nFood: I had seen pictures of their legendary Reuben and Pastrami sandwiches so I had to try one. My girlfriend ordered the Pastrami and I got the Reuben. My Reuben sandwich is probably the best sandwich i've had in my life stacked full of meat and topped with sauerkraut, russian dressing, and most importantly a thick slice of gruyere! Luckily my girlfriend let me take a bite of the Pastrami and it was just as great, but I think I would order the Reuben again. \n\nOverall, you really need to treat yourself to this place if not for the sandwiches, for their incredible brunch I've heard people rave about!",

I only wish they had more vegetarian options available. \n\nMany of the pastries are fantastic. Enjoy a fried cherry pie to pick you up during a mid day work slump or a rainbow cookie to brighten your cup of coffee. Can't go wrong with a ginger peach donut or a macaroon, either.\n\nThey have clearly marked signage to guide folks and maintain crowd control. Hand sanitizer is available, employees are masked, and there is plexi glass between you and the cashier when you order. Much appreciated!",

        "text": "Thank goodness this tasty spot is near my besties house - that gives me all the excuses I need to visit on the regular!\n\nThis fantastic spot is located at Emory Point, which has lots of spots to shop and a parking garage for parking. A sign informs that the first three hours of parking are free (but every time I have visited, the parking garage has been completely open).\n\nDuring my first visit, we came for dinner. We sat at the bar and had no wait for a seat. It was cozy and dim with a great decor. Seriously, I have tile envy.\n\nMy most recent visit was during a Saturday brunch. There were quite a few folks waiting outside, but the weather was perfect, and there was a nice, grassy spot next door for us to wait. The extra dose of Vitamin D (during this winter that is lasting a bit too long for my tastes) was good for our bodies and our souls. Again, we sat and the bar and had EXCELLENT service. Everyone was friendly and attentive.  \n\nNow - the reason for my recent visit. This poutine. I had seen a pic on Instagram, and immediately, I knew. This poutine was made for me. I scheduled the brunch date and rushed over. It was everything I had hoped for. Fries, doused in chicken gravy, cheese curds, and pastrami. It. Was. Everything. Get thee to General Muir and try this divine creation. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",

The Matzo Ball Soup was quite palatable with a great balance of herbs and broth. I had the special matzo brei that came with pastrami and maple syrup. Yes....I know sounds super weird...but it was *amazing*. The saltiness of the pastrami was balanced by the sweetness of the maple syrup which paired beautifully with the creamy matzo brei. The oddest thing was when I went to the bakery to get some bagels, the girl told me she was closed, despite just serving another customer right before me. I let the manager know, and he was so kind and got us free bagels.",

        "text": "Finally had the chance to go to TGM for lunch. I have had their delicious bagels for take out. While the food quality was excellent, the service was poor. There were at least 4 staff standing around the order station but only one helping customers. \nWe ordered soft drinks and it took several minutes (after asking twice) to get a cup of ice and straws. We were told they would bring our food out to us. We had a sandwich and a fully accessorized bagel. After a few minutes a server brought out the sandwich and asked if we'd already gotten the bagel. Ah, no, we hadn't. A few minutes later still the bagel was delivered.  \n\nA few other comments: \n1. Put napkins in your bags. Better yet, dump the bags and put napkins in the boxes. Do I really need a box in a bag?\n2. I bet the time it took you to develop & print the \"outside table rules\" is more than it would take for one of your many idle staff people to come outside & clean the tables.\n3. One trash can at the far end of the outside dining area isn't enough.\n4. Consider moving your take-out parking to the sunny spots and letting the customers who will likely be there longer have the shady spots.\n5. Study the customer service techniques and philosophy of Zingerman's Deli in Ann Arbor, MI. They have it down pat.",

The dining room is sleek yet welcoming and the noise is well-controlled for the open air-ish space.\n\nIt had been a good number of years, probably six, since I'd been until our visit NYD. We met friends about 10am and it was a perfect spot for an early eating start to 2020. Everyone loved their food and my burger was as good as it looked; an old school kind of double stack with just cheese, and the crispy edges of a flat top burger (that might not be how it's cooked but that's how it struck me!) and great fries. My husband had the pastrami sandwich and a friend had one of the salmon/lots of capers picks! I forget the fourth choice because our conversation was so good!\n\nThey also have a juice selection with classics like the little bottled apple juice with the white cap whose name I forget but contents I recall loving as a kid!\n\nDon't get to the Emory area often but this is worth the not-so-far drive from Buckhead!",

I must admit that I'm one of those folks that enjoys customizing their orders (sorry!), so I normally would get the Burger Stack with Gruyere cheese (in place of cheddar) plus pastrami. There's something about that flavor combination that yielded a very \"melt-in-your-mouth\" and otherworldly experience for me.

There is free parking in the parking deck across the street for the first 3hrs. No validation required. \n\nWe came here for a work lunch and the 6 if us were seated right away no reservation, I was shocked (then again it was 11:30 sooo). Now I'm a water with lemon kinda gal, but when the waitress recommended the sparkling strawberry lemonade I just had to try it, put sparkling in front of anything and I'm sold. Btw it was so good I forgot to the pic until I was already half way done with the drink.\n\nAnyway I can't lie I wasn't all that impressed with the offerings on the menu because soup, sandwiches, and salad aren't that exciting. But for my meal I opted for the tuna melt with gruyere, arugula, avocado, & red onions with a side French fries. That sandwich was honestly everything. I love tuna and it was perfect, just the right size and all the ingredients went together well. The French fries were also amazing, I can't lie I dipped it in that Mayo or aioli that it came with and it brought those delicious potato sticks to life. Because I'm greedy I also ordered a rice pudding with candied pistachios to go. I wasn't too impressed. This may sound dumb but I thought the rice pudding would be more tapioca and less rice nevertheless it was okay if you like literal rice, milk & sugar w/pistachios on top.",

        "text": "I gave it a 4-star but not entirely happy about it.\n\nI remember coming to GM a few years ago and sat at the patio, the food was very good but it wasn't pet friendly. Fast forward to today, I read a review that said it was pet-friendly and I thought they finally opened up the patio for dogs and I even called to make sure that they are and was told that the patio is heated and dog-friendly and it is empty and open. So I hurriedly left the house, 20mins later I show up with friend and dog in tow - PATIO IS NOT DOG-FRIENDLY.\n\nI was furious, but because I love the food there, I had to walk hungry Simba back to the car (had wanted to feed him breakfast while we ate ours) and walked back to have my breakfast.\n\nWe were quickly seated and they kept apologizing profusely that it was a miscommunication. The dog-friendly part of the patio was outside the fence, which technically not GM's patio. So, to set the record straight, THEY ARE STILL NOT PET-FRIENDLY.\n\nAnyhow, they brought us a basket of pastries to make up for the miscommunication. It was really nice of the manager, she didn't have to but I appreciate.\n\nSo now I know, the status still stands.\n\n1. Not dog-friendly\n2. Very good food\n3. Great service\n4. Great customer relation\n5. Will come back again (expectations managed)\n\nGood job GM!",

I changed that and came here for lunch with my family and was not disappointed and am so mad it took me so long to eat a full meal here!\n\nI started out by ordering their house hibiscus soda - it was delicious but I wasn't expecting it to be so sweet, so forewarning if you're not a fan of sweet drinks, skip this one.We ordered the poutine with pastrami, and the deviled eggs to start out with. The poutine was an instant hit at our table and I highly recommend if you want some amazing savory, cheesy yet still miraculously crispy fries! In my opinion you can never go wrong with deviled eggs so they were great in my book!\n\nIt was a cold snowy day when we came here so I opted for the lunch soup and sandwich combo. It was matzoh ball soup with a turkey and portobello mushroom sandwich. My sister got the vegetarian (beet) Reuben which was surprisingly very tasty!\n\nOf course I couldn't leave without grabbing some bagels and a cinnamon bun before leaving - that's probably the best thing is having an amazing meal and then taking some home with you to eat for the next few days!",

        "text": "Located in Emory Point complex, General Muir is modern and cool looking from the outside and inside. Plenty of free parking in the garages.\n\nAfter living in NYC for almost 20 years, I was excited about going to this NYC style deli. I read all the great review here, so I knew it would be great. What a disappointment.\n\nWe went here with friends from out of town for a lunch/brunch on a Saturday. Despite seeing several open tables, they told us it would be a 15 minute wait. We did not mind, we figured they were just understaffed or something. \n\nAfter 15 minutes we were seated at the open tables we saw when we arrived. They handed us a one page menu with food on one side and drinks on the other side. They have a full bar but we chose coffee, since it was a brunch menu. \n\nOur waiter brought us water and coffee, then disappeared for 10 minutes or more. We finally flagged him down for some questions and sweetener for the coffee. He seemed a little bothered but eventually brought the sweetener and sort of answered our questions. He was not busy, because we saw him talking to the other staff. \n\nFlagged him down to take our order. I ordered the potato latkes, two scrambled eggs and a bagel with cream cheese. My friend ordered the English Muffin with cheese, jam and arugula. The other friend ordered the Fish and Potatoes. \n\nWe flagged the waiter down to get more coffee and waited about 30 minutes more for our food. The restaurant was fairly empty by then. The dishes looked pretty but were rather small. \n\nThe bagel was house made and not good at all. I lived in NYC and never had a bagel like this. It tasted old and bland for a sesame bagel. The cream cheese was nothing special. \n\nThe potato latkes were overcooked, hard as a rocks and dry. They were just wrong in every way. I never had latkes this bad. The scrambled egg was OK. \n\nI tasted my friend's English Muffin and it was just weird, Tons of Jam, very little cheese. I'm not sure why they had this on the menu. It was bad. My other friend said the same about the potato latkes and thought the fish was dry and oldish tasting. \n\nOverall bad service, bad food, and at 14 dollars per person, kind of pricy for what we got. Was it a bad day for them? You would probably think yes, but nothing we had was good. Even on a bad day, something should have been good. This place would not last a week in NYC.",

Absolutely wonderful. My wife had the Avenue A. It was all kinds of good. The grapefruit was an interesting twist and it totally worked. I ordered the Reuben because it is my favorite deli sandwich and I had feeling this place would get it right and they absolutely did!!!! We also got the pickled vegetables, not sure why, because not something I order all too much but they were excellent. Terrific food! Make the stop if you're passing through Atlanta. We even went to the deli counter and took some meat home. It was great too. The hits just kept coming at this place. Highly recommend",

Their salt cured pickles really highlight their hair sandwiches, which, with the structure and bite of their deeply griddled house baked bread, benefit from that slightly salty, slightly sweet palate and refreshing crisp. I don't really know what I could add beyond other reviews, but I want to emphasize how consistent their food is: over ordered the matzo ball soup and pastrami sandwich 5 times over 3 months and could not discern much variance beyond presentation.",

Paired with the fish dish it is just what I need on a lazy weekend.\nLunch for me is a pastrami sandwich with chopped liver and an Allagash White. This is possibly my favorite lunch. I've not been raised with great exposure to the finer points of chopped liver or pastrami cuisine, but I absolutely have become enamored with them served up hot with a side of fries at the General Muir.\nGet there early if you want a seat and make sure you have your whole party present when you get to the host stand.",

She loves bagels as much as I do, so of course I wanna share that with her! It filled me up without feeling over-full. Not to mention where else can you get such a bagel in Atlanta? It was kind of awkward to eat, but worth it. The Deviled Eggs are a must as a shared appetizer for the table. They were smooth, savory and delicious in flavor.\nI thought the cocktail was quite small, however it was strong. The Café au Lait was perfectly fine as well.\nOur server was Jordan. He was attentive, polite and informative.\nAs a person who generally hates breakfast, this is my favorite brunch spot now!",

No joke. The fries were COLD, the bun was cold, and the burger was lukewarm. It had obviously been sitting back there for a while before they bothered to bring it out to me. The catch is that the other two folks that were with me got there food first and it was okay. I say okay, because they weren't too pleased with the quality. When this place first opened, and for years after, I would always say it was the best burger in town, now I would just as soon go to McDonald's because there was absolutely nothing special about my meal, even after they replaced it with a hot one. And don't tell a customer that you've been having difficulties in the kitchen (I worked in several for decades) because the customer doesn't care, they only care if you serve them cold, crappy burger and fries that they paid $20 for.\nOh, I almost forgot the restroom. The one I went in looked and smelled like it hadn't been cleaned after someone had had diarrhea all over it about a month ago. There's no way I'm ever going back to this place.",
