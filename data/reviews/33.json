First of all, they have valet parking, you go inside and take elevator all the way down. We were sahmt down as soon as we arrived (reservations only) our waiter's name was Billy and he is probably one of the best waiters I've ever had!!! He was very helpful and guided us through the entire menu along with great recommendations. I had wild bore and it was a 10/10 my bf had a thick cut of veal also amazing!! But my absolute favorite was the dessert!! We had tiramisu and the chocolate torta.",

        "text": "Amazing , authentic italian restaurant! This is the best italian restaurant i've been to since i've moved to atlanta and let me tell you why:\n1. I spoke to the owner Chris who let me know what was a good time for me to come to be accommodated without a reservation and they got me right in at the bar (apparently this place gets super busy even on week nights)\n2. the bartender Amanda was lovely! she was attentive , even tho there was a rush.  she was very helpful and made an amazing espresso martini \n3. FOOD. was so good. i love that there's an option to get appetizer sizes, which allowed me to try two new things, both of which i absolutely LOVED. \n4. The ambiance of the restaurant was great. small, quaint place, but great for date nights, birthdays, anniversaries, you name it. All of the staff was very attentive and friendly to me. \nSafe to say i will be a regular here.",

        "text": "For my anniversary I came here with my wife. Needing to find something that we both love, La Grotta checked all the boxes. Italian, but not just normal Italian dishes. Something that has sort of everything and things we haven't seen before. \nI definitely have to say my time here was wonderful!\n\nParking is valet only, but it's complimentary. I mean, I tipped the valet so take it as you will. Walking down, the restaurant is not on a rooftop, but rather in the basement pretty much. After stepping out of the elevator it felt as if I was going into a cave, but it opens out into a big dining room and when we were there it was pretty packed. Since it seems that COVID-19 is over, no one wore masks so that was that. The seating wasn't really socially distanced either so if you're still worried about that keep that in mind. \n\nFood wise: For appetizers we ordered the Burrata di Mozzarella Fresca and the Carpaccio di Tonno con Avocado e Caperi. The cheese was fresh, and the tuna was magnificent. I would say though between the two on which was better would definitely be the cheese. Sadly, I did not do my due diligence as far as taking pictures of this because we just demolished the dish. It was gone as soon as it hit our table.\n\nFor mains, I got the Filetto di Manzo alla Toscana and it was great! Tomatoes definitely cut through and was just right. I think for sure that those tomatoes were the star of that dish. The meat, obviously was great but mixed all together was something different. I definitely recommend this dish. As a side, we shared wild mushrooms. It was alright, but I don't think it was worth what it was worth.\n\nDessert, I got the Tiramisu which was great. I think it was sort of on the sweet side, but otherwise I had no issues and enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend La Grotta if you want an amazing date night with good Italian food.",

In my last two visits here, I have enjoyed both the steak and the lobster pasta, along with a few appetizers such as the calamari and caprese salad. Cocktails are always on point and the desserts are also delicious.\nWould be a full five stars, but at our last visit here, which was booked for 8pm, we ended up not getting seated until 9 or after. They must have severely overbooked this night, as people waiting for a table were stacked out from the host desk all the way back to the elevator. Even then, the food and service was well-worth the long wait.",

Unfortunately, neither one of us was impressed.\n\nI'm not sure if it was an off night (Saturday during prime dinner time) but we found the food to be just mediocre. The service staff was kind and attentive, but the food honestly felt lackluster and dated. Even the vibes inside the restaurant made it seem like this place was in its hey-day 20 years ago.\n\nWe've since found other restaurants that we feel more closely match what we're looking for in a special occasion restaurant (for instance, Atlas, Lyla Lila, and Bacchanalia).\n\nNot sure that we'll return to La Grotta anytime soon.",

After some time, we were sat in the middle of a really small and busy restaurant. The restaurant space here was super tight. We felt like our elbows were touching the people behind us. \n\nOur server always seemed as if he was a in rush. Not once did our server make eye contact with us nor did he write down the specifics/accommodations we wanted in our dish. \n\nWe ordered Shoot the Meese, chicken parm, mussels, sacchetti, and tortelini. \n\nEverything was just okay. The portions were small. Service was awful. We won't be back. We came here to celebrate a birthday and this clearly wasn't the best spot for it. We had really high expectations for this spot as this was recommended from a friend who swears by this place.

        "text": "La Grotta was a hidden gem in Atlanta. You take the elevator downstairs and walk down a moody  hallway that makes it feel like you are in a cave, hense the name. After talking with the host the restaurant opened up in front of us and we were seated in the middle of the dining room. The restaurant was beautiful and upscale. They have floor to ceiling windows along one wall that give you a view out to their spacious patio. I wouldn't say that this restaurant is perfect for a one on one date night, it did lack some feel of intimacy with the layout of a large open dining room.  Our table of four ordered multiple small plates and well as a few entrees to all share. The hot appetizer of snails were amazing. The snails were prepared well and very tender and the spinach and cream gave the dish a perfect level of richness. The beef carpaccio was a welcome bite of acid following the snails. This was possibly the best carpaccio I've ever had. Our entrees were also well received with the table. Overall I would like to return to La Grotta but only with a group of friends or family.",

        "text": "Took my daughter here for her birthday last night . Her and her friends loved this place. All three of the appetizers that we ordered were excellent, and all four of our meals were very good. The veal Marcella was the best marsala sauce I've ever had, and I have spent some time in Italy. My daughters lobster in pasta dish was so good. My dish was a spicy shrimp and pasta, now I will say the shrimp was very fresh, and they were very big. excellent taramisu , and ricotta cheesecake. My only complaint is we had a 930 reservation, we were sat at about 9:50, the waiter checked his watch while talking with us, that was a clue, he told us we only had 10 minutes to order our entrée. We hadn't even ordered or appetizers yet or really looked through the menus. Now if we were at a wings join or pizza joint I could understand but we were going to drop $400 so I felt like that was completely inappropriate. Other than that it was a lovely evening. I know this restaurant is an OG in Buckhead so I'm glad i got a chance to take the girls.",

        "text": "Hey La Grotta, \n\nYesterday was my parents 38th wedding anniversary. So, because they are wonderful parents, I decided to call you guys and ask if you could bring them a dessert at the end of the meal. A request I would imagine you all get semi-regularly. The host was very kind on the phone. I explained to please let them know their son John says happy anniversary. A piece of tiramisu, easy, paid for, great. Lovely. Life's good. \n\nFlash forward. I don't receive a text or call from my very communicative father after their meal. If the dessert had landed properly, they would have thanked me. Hm. Sirens in my brain going ringy dingy. \n\nCome to discover a dessert was brought to them and the waiter/waitress told my parents \"IT WAS FROM A FRIEND\". Not even a name. A friend. Someone from college perhaps? That neighbor down the road? A friend wanted you all to have a lovely dinner. Nailed it. \n\nI'm not mad, just disappointed. I've heard great things about this restaurant and thought a simple game of telephone would be an easy assignment. Please do better, as I was even charged 20% gratuity for this. I hope this is executed better for the next anniversary \n\nJohn",

        "text": "Opened since 1978, and coined as the first true Italian fine dining restaurant in Atlanta, I am glad to say this place is still around.  Being a former member at the church next door (Christ The King), I guess I always took it for granted and never came here.\n\nTo get started, this place (as many before me have said), is old school.  It is 42 years old, and only has 270 something yelp reviews.  That's because, well, it doesn't really need any, and the majority of the clientele does not use yelp.  Mostly, you will get the old money families here.  With that being said, you can enjoy a peaceful evening here for the most part (not those blistering loud places with screaming kids or drunk 20somethings).  \n\nWhile coats are not required, they ask you doll up a little bit.  Shorts are not allowed in the dining room, but the patio is a little more relaxed.  I won't lie, I put on slacks and dress shoes, a lot different than my typical shorts, old work shirts, and steel toes.\n\nThey have valet here, or you can park literally next door.  The valet does share the same lot as the self park, so they are all under the same roof..  Those guys probably get a run for their money here.  Since this is located in a condo building in the basement, the staff asks you keep it quiet, as people do live here (the building itself opened in 1975).\n\nReservations, you better get them, unless you want to sit at the bar (which is small, but was empty tonight).  They offer outdoor and indoor seating.  We decided to sit outside, as it was a perfect night- no wind, perfect temp, perfect lighting.  As it got darker, they had cool market lighting come on.\n\nOur server was Eduardo (sp?), and he was very friendly.  I also heard the staff here speaks 5 languages (German, Italian, English, French, and Spanish)- if it is a requirement for everyone, I am not sure- but that is pretty cool.  I heard they have a lot of long term servers here as well, which makes it great for repeat visits.\n\nWe decided to get a few apps (and mind you, due to space constraints, I will use the shorthand names)- the snails, the carpaccio, and the bufala caprese.  We also got bread along with torino sticks.\n\nThe carpaccio to start, was some of the best I have had.  With the cheese and seasoning, it was better than most wagyu carpacs I have had- this is a must try for meat and cheese lovers.   The snails, they were cooked perfectly, but just a tad under seasoned.  With the spinach, I scarfed em all.  And, the caprese, which I am not usually a fan of tomatoes, everything melded well together.  It was all fresh and I enjoyed it immensely.  \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the chicken parm, and a side of fettucine alfredo.  I also put in an order for later for mom (a entrée fettucine alfredo and asparagus) to bring home.\n\nThe chicken parm, I wont lie, again, was some of the best I have had.  Since it was not overly breaded, the integrity of the breasts were spot on- along with the sauce and cheese.  So juicy.  The pasta was nice with it.  However, when I had that side of fettucine, I was actually thinking about eating mom's on the way home.  \n\nDessert, I had the panna cotta.  That was spectacular as well.  They have a full bar and a lot of old school drinks to offer here as well, especially for dessert, but I opted out like a sober little Tommy (that drink wall did get my hand shaking though!).\n\nWhen it was time to get the check, I realized the togo stuff was not on there, Eduardo apologized and rectified that quickly.  I guess that worked out though because- he still remembered what I wanted, and it came out later, so it stayed warmer for the 30 min drive home.  No harm no foul.\n\nThe really only thing that prevented 5 stars for me were these 2 things- first, not all staff had gloves (which you know people can take it as they wish).  But next, they seated a 16 top outside, and the people, well, they brought a few bottles of wine from home (which they vehemently state on their menu and online they do not accept outside bottles at this time)- so I am not sure why they were the exception to that rule.  Sorry, but trying to keep everyone safe, means everyone needs to play by the rules, or don't have them at all- but that is just me.\n\nAlso, one more thing, keep an eye out for black truffle season, as they have a menu with new items pertaining to it, or you can add it shaved to any dish for $22.95.  Also, make sure you check out the specials.\n\nIs this the best Italian in Atlanta?  That is a tough call.  But, with the years of regulars, they keep coming back for a reason.  I am sure the consistent top notch service, the privacy, and the old world flavors have a lot to do with it- I mean, and the fact it is in the basement of a 45 yo condo building, it really is in a class of its own.  So I will leave at this- if you are a fan of Italian cuisine, this is not to be missed.  I mean also, the prices aren't that bad either, and I actually left full and satisfied, but not with overbearing pastasweats.",

        "text": "I visited La Grotta for the first time this evening for a work dinner. I have been somewhat disappointed with service at good restaurants in Atlanta since COVID (I get it, restaurants are short staffed everywhere, but at some places you expect the best given what you're paying). Service at La Grotta was impeccable. Our lead server (Brett or Brent, it was a little loud and I was across the table) was knowledgeable, present just when needed but not hovering, and ready to make recommendations given no one at the table had dined there before. We had 6 people in our party. \n\nPre-dinner drinks were mostly classics (Negroni, Manhattan, etc.). My dirty martini was ice-cold, perfectly briny, and they stuff their own blue cheese olives. Some places have stopped doing that and I hate it. Pre-stuffed olives are horrifically bad. Strong start!\n\nWe all ordered the mixed pasta appetizer, which is essentially a greatest hits of their pasta dishes: one bite of three different pasta dishes for each of us; we left the selection to our server's recommendation. He opted for a short rib filled tortellini-like item; sacchetti with fontina, cream, and truffle; and a portobello ravioli. All were excellent, but the short rib dish was the least memorable. I would order either the sacchetti and mushroom ravioli as an entree in a heartbeat.\n\nWe followed this with a poached pear bruschetta course. Delicate and delicious.\n\nFor entrees, most of us ordered the evening specials. 2 folks ordered a snapper dish that met with high praise, and 2 of us (including me) ordered a \"duck duo\": seared and sliced duck breast and a duck leg confit over polenta. It was outstanding.\n\nDesserts: following recommendations again, desserts ordered were panna cotta, tiramisu, and creme brûlée. I ordered creme brûlée (as I always do when it's on the menu and I'm getting dessert). It was a classic preparation, and expertly done and delicious. I also ordered coffee, which is why I'm writing this novel of a review at 12:38AM... damn it.\n\nI look forward to coming back to La Grotta many times in the future, especially as I live less than a mile away. Great service, great food, and by no means overpriced: most entrees were $25-$30 dollars and I would pay more than that for the quality. It's been around for forever, and sure seems like it will be in the future: we had a 5:45PM reservation (they open at 5:30) and the restaurant was full from the moment we sat down until we left at 8:15.\n\nTip for gents: jackets are recommended. I didn't know this until a friend told me today, and I'm sure glad I was wearing one. More fellas were wearing them than not.",

        "text": "We're excited to be in the Peach State this week to visit family who live in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood.\n\nFor one of our weeknight family dinners, we grabbed an early reso at La Grotta, an Atlanta institution and a AAA 4-Diamond \nrecipient for the last 20 years.  Atlanta Magazine also voted La Grotta as Atlanta's Best  Italian Restaurant for 18 consecutive years.  I was psyched for my first dining experience at La Grotta. \n\nThis award-winning restaurant is located on a beautiful stretch of Peachtree Road in the heart of Buckhead.  On a beautiful Georgian evening, we opted to dine outdoors in the beautiful courtyard located adjacent to the main dining room. \n\nOur dinner began with a toast from a magnum of my favorite Italian wine...Brunello Di Montalcino. It was a great start to what would become an unquestioned 5-star dining experience. \n\nWe started with a trio of both cold and hot appetizers along with a special off-menu appetizer of three unique pastas. Wow, what an awesome treat made by the chef who has continuously led the La Grotta kitchen for 43 consecutive years!\n\nOur entrees ranged from the ever-popular bone-in Veal Parm to the Risotto del Giorno to the hearty Penne Bolognese to a pan-roasted Halibut Steak.  We also enjoyed several side dishes of Angel Hair pasta with marinara sauce. The five of us all raved about the quality and taste of our feast. \n\nOur knowledgeable lead server \"Tex\" did a masterful job of guiding us through the whole experience.   \n\nLa Grotta is Italian dining at its very finest...Highly recommended.",

They fill up, so be sure to make a reservation well ahead of time! The dress code is business casual. Check the website for specifics. They have complimentary valet parking. I didn't notice anywhere to self park. The restaurant is located on the bottom floor of an condo complex. We sat inside, but they do have a lovely outdoor patio! Our waiter was great - very attentive and gave great suggestions. We started with some drinks. Our waiter suggested the pasta tasting that they provide for parties of 5 or larger. It came with a sample of 3 pastas for everyone to try. Very tasty. We all ordered entrees. We got the chicken parm with a substitute of carbonara, penne bolognese, tortellini, lobster pasta and a Caesar salad. It was all great! A cool dining experience.",

We were wowed by the service and attentiveness of everyone that greeted and seated us. \n\nThe restaurant has rustic appeal while walking in; however the food was disappointing. The cheese on the chicken parm was rubbery and my gnocchi was lacking flavor. Side note: don't get an appetizer size it's more like a sample. \n\nThe server never mentioned my birthday despite being asked multiple times by the hostess if we were celebrating anything.\n\nPersonally, I don't like my tiramisu to have almond extract in it even though that's one of the more popular desserts.\n\nThe service was amazing nonetheless.",

While the entrance is nothing to look at, we were pleasantly surprised by how nice the interior of the restaurant was. But this is where the excellence stopped. The food is mediocre at best - I would actually say on par with an Italian chain restaurant like Olive Garden or Carrabbas but at 4x the price. Our waiter was unable to pronounce a single item on the menu and was rather rude and disruptive throughout the meal. I am genuinely confused where such positive reviews come from in regards to this restaurant. Save your time and money and bring them to a place with actual excellent Italian cooking.",

From the time you get off the elevator, you truly feel like you're stepping into a refined cave (hence the name) with cozy lighting and a buzzy crowd of revelers, business men and couples on dates.  The space includes a small bar (perfect if you arrive a bit early) and there is also a decent sized patio for al fresco dining.  And the food?  Truly exceptional.  The meat entrees I have tried are all amazing and generously sized (try the Filetto di Manzo and thank me later); the pasta dishes are wonderful as well.

        "text": "I heard great reviews for La Grotta so after moving here recently and Italian being my favorite cuisine it was a must. It was a bit hard to get a reservation so I decided to go for takeout since it's only 5 mins away and I knew it would still be fresh and hot. From my phone call that should've been the dead giveaway, acting all nice and professional while taking my order for take out to at the end asking me how much am I leaving for tip for the staff and once I respectfully declined as I don't do that for take out he instantly got so rude and unprofessional. Now that's just the customer service portion and no matter how bad that was if the food was good I'd say the honest truth. Not only was it bland with no flavor but it was cold dripping with oil and tasted like rubber. Horrible restaurant.",

The patio was beautiful, even on a chilly February night. \n\nFor appetizers, we had beef rib ravioli and beef carpaccio. I highly recommend the beef rib ravioli, special of the night. \n\nFor entrees, we had the scaloppine di Vitello Antonio (pass), Sacchetti di Formaggio (highly recommend), Sogliola di Dover (delicious), and Pappardelle Con Astice (amazing). I paired my entree with a nice glass of red, based on our server's recommendation. \n\nWe ended the night with the tiramisu and an expresso.  \n\nAmazing food!

First time going and decided to sit in the patio and that was a great choice even though it was cold the night I went (they have lots of warmers to keep you warm).\n\nFor appetizers my party decided to get some of the pasta dishes to try. The best one was Sacchetti di Formaggio e Tartufi Neri. The dish was absolutely amazing! Highly recommend.\n\nThe Tortelloni Della Casa and Pappardelle Con Astice (lots of lobster in this one) both were really good as well! \n\nFor mains we tried two of the  veal loin scaloppines and both were very tasty however I have had better veal dishes at other classic Italian restaurants. Next time I would try another protein and it seemed many around us were getting other mains. \n\nFor dessert the tiramisu was very light and tasty and would recommend trying.\n\nOverall, very good Italian food, all recommendations made by server were outstanding and would return for sure!",

I asked our server for his recommendation for wine, and me not having a strong preference gave him a vague request and he still hit the mail on the head. We started with the calamari and a baby spinach salad with mushrooms and goat cheese, and both were perfectly prepared and even split by the chef before being brought out to us. For the main course, we got the Pappardelle con Astice and the Beggar's Purses. The former was absolutely loaded with lobster in a delicious wine sauce, and the latter was the best Truffle-centered course I've ever had. The Tiramisu and espresso martini for dessert left me speechless. All things considered, I would give the experience 5/5 stars, and considering the quantity of food and quality of service, I'd even consider this on the $$ side of \"$$$\".

        "text": "The Basics: La Grotta is an Italian restaurant located in Buckhead. When you pull up to the restaurant, you may think you are at the wrong location (it is located on the bottom floor of a condo complex); however, you will see the valet up front and know you actually have arrived. You take the elevator downstairs and the restaurant is quaint and authentic. The food is delicious, the wait staff is energetic and wonderful, and the restaurant as a whole feels like a hidden gem in Atlanta. \n\nThings I like: The food at La Grotta is authentic Italian food and is fresh and delicious. All of the pasta is homemade and the dishes are all delicious. They also have homemade limoncello! I have never had a bad meal here. One of my favorite dishes to order is the Gnocchi. The staff at La Grotta is also amazing. The waiters at the restaurant are often Italian and they all have big personalities that make you feel welcome. You will not be let down by the food or service here. \n\nThings I didn't like: Nothing! I have always loved my experience at La Grotta. However, it can be difficult to get a reservation here at times since the restaurant is small. I would suggest calling to make a reservation, some of the online booking sites are not accurate as to what their availability actually is on a given night. \n\nOverall, La Grotta is the place to come for fresh and authentic Italian food in Atlanta. It has an old school feel and a quaint dining room which adds to the amazing dining experience.",

        "text": "We have been coming here for 20 or more years. Always our favorite Atlanta Italian restaurant. That said when we sat down we were a party of 7 and we were presented a bread basket with 5 half slices of bread . Upon passing that around the table we asked for more and we're told it was five dollars for another basket? Are you kidding me? We having a 600 dollar plus dinner and they don't want to give a slice of bread for each person? Unbelievable. I've never heard of an upscale restaurant charging for bread.. bread costs Pennies to make...unfortunately started dinner off on a bad note.. only other issue was the mussels.. in the past they have been giant mussels these were absolutely minuscule, the meat inside like a tiny nibble....of course the sauce was delicious like always but unfortunately we didn't have any bread to mop it up.. dinner itself was fantastic, everyone loved their entrees... but please don't charge big parties for extra bread. That's insulting",

I was really confused by entrance since it is located in apartment complex, and the staff was understanding that we came in the back garden. The space is a little tight so navigation to bathroom is a struggle. The soup of the day was amazing and signature tiramisu makes all other tiramisu pail in comparison. I will comeback for another occasion because the experience is everything you expect from fine dining",

        "text": "The exceptional dining experience from last night is still lingering in my sweet memories. The food and the service are both superb. Among all the fabulous Italian restaurants I have tried, La Grotta is one of the best.\n\nLa Grotta is located at the basement of a condo building on Peachtree St. It delivers an intimate, cozy ambiance within the dining room. You can also choose to sit at the \"garden\" as well, which would be very nice also. The service is excellent. There are two waitresses and a \"bus boy\" serving every table. Apart from catering to all our requests, they had shared some interesting, casual conversations with us.\n\nWhat did we order?\nWe had white bean soup with drizzles with truffle oil as appetizer. The entree we ordered is grilled veal chop (added shaved French black truffles for $23/dish). The portion of the white bean soup is generous. I recommend sharing the soup between two people, so that you can save room for entree and desserts. The grilled veal chop is perfectly done. The veal comes out as \"medium\" temperature inside, and extremely juicy. Truffle shaving was done table-side. \n\nEven though having dinner here is not the cheapest, we appreciate our moments here every time. I highly recommend La Grotta to anyone.",

        "text": "Hidden gem in Buckhead area of Atlanta! We heard Pastor Chris at Church of the Highlands mention a great Italian place in Atlanta and we deducted that it was La Grotta and we're so glad he mentioned it. Driving by you'd never know it was a restaurant but don't be fooled. Complimentary valet up front where there's a sign to turn it. Then you walk down a hall to an elevator down to the basement where the restaurant is. Feels like you're stepping back in time and the atmosphere is so enjoyable and relaxing. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary by splitting the Caesar salad which were still good size portions even split in half and the dressing was delicious. I went with the Pappardelle con astice (warm lobster on a bed of wide pappardelle noodles) - so good! Wife had beef tenderloin on bed of mashed potatoes and vegetables and she said it was so nice and tender and melted in mouth. We split tiramisu for dessert and it was phenomenal as well. Everything from server, food, experience was 5 stars.",
