        "text": "Location: The Southern Gentleman is located on the second level of Buckhead Village. Such an amazing place for a weekend errand or shopping excursion. It's surrounded by some great Atlanta restaurants and shops. I parked in the parking deck across from Fetch and you get your ticket validated. I just moved to the area and can't wait to explore what more it has to offer!\nFood/Price: This establishments is your typical mid to high level restaurant. I came for brunch so I would assume diner would be at least $30 per person. The She's a Peach is good and strong around $15. We had the chocolate chip banana bread and the white cheddar hush puppies with the goat cheese crèma. AMAZING! a must try if you go. For entrees, we had the fried chicken and skillet cake, short rib hash, and peach cobbler French toast. Everything was delicious!\nService: Our waitress McKayla was great and attentive! Our orders came out one after the other. Luckily we did have a reservation. \nAtmosphere: This restaurant is decorated beautifully for Christmas and feels like the inside of a grand hotel lobby. Picturesque!\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed the Southern Gentleman. I can't wait to return and inquire if they allow big parties for birthday dinners!",

Make sure to bring the ticket from the parking lot inside because they validate parking. \nI was able to make a reservation on Open Table the day prior so the process was super easy. I ordered an aperol spritz which was perfectly made! For our appetizers we ordered deviled eggs and white cheddar hushpuppies. My favorite hands down were the hushpuppies, the goat cheese cream was so fluffy and delicious! It paired really well. For my entree I ordered the fried chicken and country skillet cake. I was craving a salty - sweet brunch meal and this hit the spot! It's a different spin on the traditional chicken and waffles so I'm glad I tried it. The serving is super big so I had plenty to take home.",

Service was a bit rushed since we could only get a resy 30 mins before closing, so we had to put our orders in asap before kitchen closed. \n\nI started out with the She's a Peach cocktail which tasted like a very delicious Bellini. For apps we got the white cheddar hush puppies which were very decadent but very good. For the entree I got the shrimp and grits which was truly a 10/10 for me. The shrimp were tender and the sauce was so flavorful, would definitely come back for this again! We also got to try an espresso martini which was lacking a bit for me. \n\nLoved the interior and the patio, and while the service was rushed, our server was very nice and efficient.

        "text": "Came here for a friends birthday a few weeks ago!\n\n***LOCATION***\nThere is a parking garage right next to the restaurant and THEY VALIDATE PARKING by scanning your ticket at the front (up to 2 hours I believe). \n\n***ATMOSPHERE***\nThe inside is very nice! It's like a chic southern food vibe. Wasn't too loud and the decor is nice! \n\n***STAFF***\nI wish I could remember our waitresses name, but she was super friendly! We took forever to decide and even had someone showing up late but she was so patient with us!\n\n***FOOD/DRINKS***\nThey have lots of options! Not too many vegetarian options, but they had some. They had 1 or 2 entrees, but I wasn't really interested in those that night. I opted for the Mac and cheese appetizer as my meal and it was very filling! It was very good and I also got a side of sweet potato cornbread which was definitely unique and tasted very good as well!\nI got a sour beer to drink and it was normal, and reasonably priced! \n\n***PRICE***\nThey definitely are more upscale but they have options for everyone. I think my Mac and cheese was 15$ + 6$ I think for the cornbread. The draft beer was around 7$ I believe. They had entrees ranging from 18$ to like 60$. That's nice that they have such a range so that everyone in the party can order what they are comfortable with. The fried chicken was a favorite in our group and I believe it was around 21$. \n\nThe only thing is that they won't split checks more than 2 ways unless everyone pays the same amount so it's divided equally. We were a group of 10 I think, so she divided the whole check and split it all evenly. Just something to note if you are going with a big party, either be prepared to split everything equally or Venmo each other! She did let us all know ahead of time though which was nice!\n\n***CONCLUSION***\nWould definitely come back!",

She was super efficient, so friendly, could recommend menu items and was hustling to make everyone happy at all her tables!! \nFood was again fantastic.  We shared the deviled eggs, hush puppies and smoked bacon. Food disappeared so fast Its a wonder I was able to take pictures of most of it. We had entrees from the braised short rib hash, the croissant sandwich, French toast and soft scrambled eggs. All were delicious!  We got the apple cobbler and chocolate cake desserts to go. No pictures but both were also great.  \n\nGet this spot on your list soon!",

We arrived around 5:15/5:30ish on a Friday. Perfect time as it was easy to get a table, and we still had about 30 mins left for happy hour. \n\nI ordered a drink called the Watermelon Basil Spritze ($9), Fried Green Tomatoes ($10), and the Sweet Potato Cornbread ($6- this is a side from their dinner menu). The drink was nice and refreshing. Perfect for a spring day. I absolutely looooved the fried green tomatoes! They were perfectly seasoned and sat on a spread of homemade pimento cheese with chunky pieces of fried bacon. This is a must have! The sweet potato cornbread was very good as well. It tasted like a cake, just not as sweet. My friends ordered a few sides and some other drinks as the night went on. Overall, I was impressed! I really look forward to coming back and trying more items on their menu!",

Parking is $5 for up to 3 hours; however, this restaurant validated parking for up to 2 hours. Be sure to bring your parking slip.\n\nThe Service: The service was good. Our waitress was really nice!\n\nThe Atmosphere: It's like between mid-scale and upscale vibes. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Nice luxurious bar with many TV screens.\n\nThe Food: This time around, I had the Classic Double Patty Cheeseburger (lettuce, red onion, bistro sauce. bread 8 butter pickles) & fries - $19. It was pretty good! I also ordered \"She's a Peach\" (gin, peach, lemon, rosé) - $13 and a Miller High Life - $4.\n\nOverall, it was a decent time.",

        "text": "The Southern Gentleman is located in Buckhead Village, next to Gypsy Kitchen. There is some street metered parking (4hr max), but there is also a parking garage (0-3hrs $5). \n\nThe restaurant opened at 4pm and we got there around 4:15 on a Monday. It is usually best to make a reservation, but we didn't this time because they had just opened and had tons of availability. As we walked in, we were seated right away. \n\nOur server, Shannon, came over right away with waters and to go over the menu. She was great! And straight to it. She told us all of her favorite menu items, and the way she described everything we had to try them. We started with the Deviled Eggs and the White Cheddar Hushpuppies. I usually find Hushpuppies kinda dry, but these were moist and the goat cheese crema with sugarcane syrup topped it off! Oh and fyi they do have happy hour M-F 4-6pm on food and drinks! For drinks we got the Grey Goose Spritzer and the Southern Gentleman. \n\nAll of the entrees \"Supper\" looked good. We decided on the Braised Short Rib and Pan Seared Redfish. The food came out hot and perfectly prepared. The short rib was juicy and so tender it could be cut with a fork. The red fish came with a Geechie style rice purloo, which was the perfect pair for the fish. With all the delicious food we had to get a dessert. We ordered the Fried Apple Turnover...but when Shannon checked with the kitchen they were out of it. She was very apologetic and brought us the Chocolate layer cake AND the coconut cream pie because of the slight confusion. \n\nThe dining experience at The Southern Gentleman was on of the best experiences I've had in a while thanks to Shannon! She was an amazing server. Very attentive, she took time to get to know us, and we're basically family now lol. I will definitely be back!",

Let me start off by saying that our waitress Shannon was absolutely AMAZING!! She was very personable, provided great service, and had great energy which contributed to the overall experience.\n\nNow for the food. We started with the white cheddar hushpuppies as an appetizer which was great. For our main course, my parents and myself had the braised short rib which came with sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes, and onion strings (as decor). Loved the short rib! It was very tender and juicy. We also ordered a side of mac n' cheese which was equally amazing.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the chocolate layered cake and fried apple turnover. I prefer the apple turnover over the chocolate cake. They also gave my dad a birthday pudding and our table complementary champagne with our dessert. This was a fantastic experience and I'm looking forward to brunch/dinner here again soon.",

Upon entering, we immediately felt welcomed. The manager sat us outside on the patio, it had the best views of The skyline in Buckhead.\n\nThe food was great, kudos to the chef! Southern gentleman's Mamosa carafe is probably a Buckhead, well-kept secret, we had enough for about seven mimosas, and at only 44 bucks I think that's a steal :) \n\nDefinitely will be back  :))))",

We were easily able to call in and make a reservation of 7 for Sunday. Upon arrival we were seated outside unexpectedly. It was not a big deal because it was a nice day outside but it would have been nice to have been given a heads up when the reservation was confirmed.\n\nWe had some time to review the menu and everything looked so good that we had a hard time making up our minds. Some of the things we ordered were the white cheddar hush puppies, deviled eggs, Southern fried chicken & skillet cake, burgers. We also got a variety of drinks including the mimosa flights, Expresso martini, Breakfast in GA, Southern Belle. Everything was amazing and I cannot wait to come back!",

It was sitting on a nice blend of vegetables and roasted finagling potatoes with a puréed garlic that was brilliantly accompanied with a balsamic glaze. I tried the French fries on the double cheeseburger entree and they were great as well and nicely salted. Definitely a place I would like to visit again next time I am in town.",

My husband's mom's food came out cold (the lobster) and rubbery, and my mother's food was inedible. Hard bacon that she could tap against a glass. Everything came out within less than five minutes, which I imagine is because it was prepped beforehand. Just an overall awful experience.\n\nEdit: the uniformity here was strange as well. We ordered two chocolate cakes slices for dessert - one was large with no white cream on top, and the other was extremely small with the cream. To the credit of the manager, he did bring my husband another larger slice for free, which was nice.\n\nI was pretty embarrassed to have flown my mom into town for a few hours and this was the experience she had.",

The white cheddar hush puppies were the standout app, so yummy I'm drooling writing about them right now. \n\nWe then all ordered the grilled New York strip with seared tomatoes and asparagus, Demi glacé and pomme purée (a fancy mashed potatoes dish). I added a glass of Malbec to compliment my entree and thoroughly indulged. \n\nThe kitchen even cuts the steak perfectly for you so all you have to do is feed yourself. Ooh la la! I have to visit again the next time I'm in the A.",

The staff was super accommodating during the time but we had to leave and never got to eat. Super bummed because I was looking forward to the meal after the good apps.
