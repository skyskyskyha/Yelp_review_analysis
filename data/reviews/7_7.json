We'd been here a couple years ago but I don't remember the vibe or quality of their food. This time, we weren't satisfied with our food at all. I ordered the Nashville's hot chicken with the pimento cheese grits. I tried to eat it but once I bit into the chicken I was instantly turned off. The patty tasted like frozen chicken (which may be okay for some). My daughter ordered the oatmeal and she was not a fan. My partner ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was the same, lackluster. I wish I could rate this place higher, but it just wasn't giving me anything I needed.",

        "text": "We arrived at the restaurant, and the parking lot was fairly full, but we were able to locate an empty space up front.  On Sundays there are several lots open for overflow parking.  The host at the door was such a friendly and kind gentleman! \n He set our expectations that it would be 60-90 minutes and that we have 5 minutes to arrive after they text our phone.  He also said it could be earlier, so be ready.  We waited about 45 minutes and sat at a shared table in the bar.  \n\nThe food was very good.  The biscuit was heavenly, and the hash browns were the most flavorful I've ever tasted.  \n\nThe only reason I didn't give 5 stars:  Our server was nice, but it started off weird as she looked at my daughter and asked around to find out who sat her there... it made us feel that she thought my daughter sat herself the way she was asking around \"WHO sat them there\".  But once she realized we were officially supposed to be there, she was nice and friendly.  The food came out quickly, and the presentation was nice.  \n\nThe mimosa was delicious also.",

Maybe it was an off day, but we felt forgotten. I watched two tables around us who were seated after us received drinks and appetizers while we waited for our waitress to acknowledge us. \n\nWe eventually received water and placed our drink orders, as well as a cinnamon roll to start. 15-20 minutes passed and our waitress came up to our table and asked if we ordered a starter. We reminded her we did, and she eventually placed it in alongside our entrees. I ordered the hot chicken and grits, while my friend had pancakes and some sausage on the side. Our entrees came a few minutes after our cinnamon roll, so kudos to the kitchen for getting that done quickly. \n\nMy friend asked for another side of syrup. And to no surprise... she never received it until she had to remind our waitress again.\n\nAgain, maybe it was an off day, but it was very off putting for us to constantly ask and remind our waitress what we ordered. I might come back, but I'm not in a rush to do so.",

We were seated quickly and the turnaround from the time we ordered to getting our food was amazingly fast especially given how busy they were.  The food was phenomenal. \nPimento cheese grits is now my thing. The best surprise was my mug of tea. The tea was good, but the mug was great. The mug wall was thick and my tea was kept at the right temperature, but the outside didn't burn my hand. Also the mug was slightly textured.",

Especially if you want to go on a weekend you better be ready to wait at least another.\n\nFood wise this place is top notch.  The sides to go for are bacon, sausage, or any fruit.  Entrees include many great dishes.  I went with the chicken and waffles.  A hefty piece of fried chicken and a fresh pancake, I had plenty of food.\n\nBut a restaurant visit is not just food.  The parking situation is a nightmare.  A few spots in the front, along with about 20 more spots in the back and adjust lot.  Be careful if you resort to parking in the nearby grocery center parking lot as signs discourage it.  The wait time and system is draining.  There is not really anywhere to stand or sit and not be in the way. Despite that it's worth a trip, it just may not be your weekly brunch spot because of the waiting time.",

Food is served very fast and waiters are polite.\n\nOverall the meals are delicious with generous portions and good quality ingredients. Was not a fan of the grits (a a little lacking in flavor, but not salt, while the potatoes were a little too salty). The chicken and waffles are a must have! Chicken is a little dry but the waffles are perfect, crispy on the outside but soft). Butter is also house made, we loved! \n\nThe feel of the restaurant is homely, like eating in someone's living room. Patio seating is spacey and heated + not loud.",

        "text": "Perhaps 4.25-4.5 stars...if I'm being precise...\n\nAfter living in Atlanta for a while, had to see what all the fuss was about. \n\nA big disclaimer is that every time I've eaten here, I arrived before 9am, maybe even 8:30am. Even getting here this early, it's usually PACKED and there is a small wait time. If you don't get here early, it's gonna be a pain. Additionally, even getting here early doesn't entire spare you of the dicey parking situation. There's a couple small gravel lots behind the restaurant but they are SMALL. So yeah, if you drive a large truck or SUV, good luck. I really hope they are able to get better parking soon!!\n\nFood wise, it's wonderful!!! Yes, they DO have the best biscuits. Massive, warm, FLUFFY, and their jams are to die for. You can really tell they're homemade. \nI they have a blueberry-basil jam (amazing, stunning, yummy) and with the chicken biscuit they serve a spicy red pepper jam, that pairs perfectly. \n\nI'm not a grit eater usually, but their pimento cheese grits are the bomb. The second time I went I ended up getting the grit bowl so Buttermilk Kitchen really converted me to the grit eating life! Additionally, if your a cold brew aficionado, theirs is divine! The portions are generous and I always leave feeling stuffed. Everything I've ever eaten here has been 10/10, and service is always solid. \n\nButtermilk Kitchen is an amazing establishment, you just have to commit to getting up early and getting there! I would be thrilled if they were able to expand, they are so popular and it would make the dining experience even better!",

        "text": "It was not my first time trying buttermilk kitchen, but it is my first review. I haven't been in awhile and wanted to take my husband, as it was his first time going. I booked our reservation about 3 weeks in advance because every time we've wanted to go, the wait has been super long. The reservation was smooth and easy. Once we arrived, we were seated right away. However, the manager asked if we didn't mind moving tables and he would bring us an appetizer. That was easy enough, so we moved to another table and opted for the cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was so hot and melted in our mouths. We went ahead and placed our drink and food orders. For drinks, we ordered a drunken peach and a Milky Way cold brew. We both enjoyed our drinks. For entrees, we ordered the chicken biscuit with pimento grits and the standard, which came with 3 choices you could select from. The food was hot and fresh and it didn't take long to come out, despite the large crowd! Overall, buttermilk kitchen was really good and we looked forward to returning in the future.",

You could tell she was happy to be there. She was knowledgeable about the menu and pointed out the most popular selections on the menu to help is get started. The restaurant is a converted older house (probs from the very early 1900's) that had rooms sectioned off, but kept the space open with exposed original beams/framing. I loved it. The only thing is was really loud and exceptionally hard to hear the person talk right in front of us.  I still gave it a five stars because everything else was on point. I highly recommend.",

My partner and I went here a weekend prior to eating here but decided to go somewhere else because there was a 2 hour wait. We still wanted to try this place, so we made a reservation for the following weekend.\n\nWe ordered the fried green tomatoes, a pancake, shrimp and grits, and a chicken biscuit. None of the food we ordered was bad, but it also didn't really blow me away, with one exception. The pancake we had was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. But ultimately I still didn't find any of it to be worth the cost. I've had just as good and even better brunch food in Atlanta for much cheaper.",

Maybe somewhere I would go if the wait was less than 15 minutes, but just didn't feel like the wait was worth the food.\n\nWhen we arrived the wait was about 45 minutes for Sunday brunch. We decided to stick it out. They do have a little area to order drinks while you wait. Their Bourbon Smash is pretty good. Once we were seated, we ordered:\n\nPickled green tomatoes: have a nice tartness to them that really does well with the breading. The crunch adds a nice texture difference to the tomatoes. Pretty good tasting dish overall.\n\nHot chicken and pimento cheese grits: grits were good and cooked well. The chicken breading was crunchy and okay. Unfortunately, the chicken was a little dry, which took away from the dish. Also, for me the chicken just seemed to be something that added to the grits, nothing really brought the dish together. Thinking back, I guess that makes sense since the dish is \"hot chicken\" and \"grits.\" For me, wasn't a very exciting dish.",

Make sure to get on the waitlist online. \n\nNOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FOOD. \n\nCoffee was a big no. Their coffee looks so cool and nice but it doesn't really taste good. I don't recommend getting. \n\nPimento Omelet - this was delicious but fair warning, the omelette is on the sweet side. The biscuit was amazing . As my side, I ordered the hash brown fritters that were good. OH the jelly WAS SO YUMMY. \n\nGrit Bowl - I'm not a grit person but I did try a little and it wasn't bad at all!  \n\nChicken Biscuit -  THIS IS IT  I think everyone's fav dish was this. The size was so big and the flavor was great. The biscuit was soft but a little crispy too. Like   \n\nThe Belt Sandwich - looked delicious but bread was too hard to enjoy it. Maybe ask them to not toast too long.\n\nEnjoy ;) - IG: Travelfoodie_ishy",

We got up early on a Sunday to make it there before the crowd and I wasn't sure what the hype was about until we got our food!\n\nI got the Standard with: Eggs, Fried Chicken, and Hashbrown Fritters. It came with the most delicious biscuit too!! I think this meal was about $17 + a little extra for the chicken. A little pricey, but this food was seriously good. \n\nI also shared some Pimento Cheese Grits with my husband. It was mouthwatering. \n\nI love a good breakfast!!",

It has easily become my favorite breakfast spot in all of Atlanta. The online waitlist has been a game changer and made coming here much easier. \n\nThe service is consistently great. The coffee is consistently great, as far as breakfast restaurant coffee goes. It's never burnt and always tastes fresh. Very balanced flavor. \n\nThe breakfast platter is my go to. Hearty portions. Not using hyperbole when I say this. The hashbrowns are the best I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned. Not oily. The jam/biscuit combo is top notch. The biscuit is so great. Solid grits and eggs. \n\nThrilled Buttermilk Kitchen is in Atlanta. Request - please please please bring back the mushroom gravy!\n\nBonus - great spot if you have a peanut allergy",

My only complaint is the host/hostess at the door. The overall process just seems disjointed. I've come and the guy particularly that works the door just isn't the right fit for that role. He can't remember names of parties and doesn't greet guest consistently. You go from 1 check in outside to inside and then you have to wait for the 2nd hostess to confirm where you should be seated. He also ask, if I have a preference for inside and outside but doesn't honor the request. On my most recent visit he asked, if I wanted to sit outside or wait longer for inside. I shared I would wait for inside seating and I was still sat outside. Overall food is really good.",

We had an hour wait for a weekday morning, I'm sure the weekends are worse. The only downfall that I see here is there is only one working bathroom, we were on a road trip and leaving for another city that morning, the wait for the bathroom was also very long. \nThe food made up for the long waits, we ordered the chicken biscuits, chicken and waffles and the French toast. It was very delicious. Service was quick and our waitress was very friendly. \nPlease give this a chance if you're in the area, but remember to make a reservation!",
