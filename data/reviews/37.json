Our \nwater glasses were always full. The blueberry foie gras was delightfully sweet and light and the salmon dip had chunks of salmon with  a delicate flavor. I'm so happy my daughter wanted to try the Amber Kaluga Caviar Service delivered to us my the very pleasant GM Victoria. It was well worth the price. The tataki was wonderful on the toasted baguette. The bolognese and gnocchi were perfect. And dessert was heavenly. The atmosphere is upscale casual. All our food is pictured below. The Woodall offers a unique quality experience.",

We came for brunch per the recommendation of some friends and were so disappointed:(\n\nThere were maybe 5 customers total while we were there, but our server still some how managed to neglect our table. She asked if we needed fresh silverware after our appetizers, never brought any- our food was getting cold so we had to steal some from the table nearby. I never got a refill on my drink and didn't have anything more than half my meal. My husband wanted another cocktail but she just never came back. You pay a premium for service and we just didn't see it. \n\nUnfortunately the bad out weighed the good here and we aren't sure we will return.",

Located in the relatively new Westside Village Center, it's convenient to both OTP and ITP clients.  Swankier than you'd expect from the outside with a new American menu.  Cocktails were well prepared and service was solid.  This would be a great place for a first date.  It's quite and the booths are cozy and private, perfect for a lingering conversation.  Great wine list, especially by the glass.",

The creme brulee made with vanilla from Madagascar hit the spot. All just delightful!\n\nOf note, I have never before seen a restaurant with a true 4.5 star rating on Yelp.

        "text": "Ugh, not impressed by brunch...\nI had the shrimp and scallops with smoked polenta.  Although the flavor of the polenta was good, it did not make up for the truly measly portion.To use shrimp and scallops in plural is quite generous - two shrimp and 2 tiny bay scallops.  Bear in mind that 6 jumbo shrimp is estimated as a 3 oz portion - and these were not jumbo.  \nI cannot remember the last time I polished off my plate AND left hungry, but here I was ~$30 later and wondering what I could eat to supplement my meal.  Others at my table had similar experiences with the pulled pork hash and chicken salad.  My cocktail was just fine.\n\nService was generally okay, but nothing exemplary.  The restaurant was about half full; ordering felt rushed but service afterward was sparse.\n\nI have dined here in the evening once before - right when they first opened.  I remember service being better, and granted I had the burger, but it was fairly filling.  I'm not sure if the place has declined (already!) or if dinner is more of their strength.  IF I do return, it will surely not be to order any of the items we experienced this time.",

Every time I've sat at the bar I'm usually ignored i have to flag down the bartender multiple times while other people not of color are served and tended to very graciously. I thought the first time maybe the bartender was just having a bad day. But every time I come to this establishment I'm never checked on , barely greeted, treated like an inconvenience when attempting to just place an order. I'm very nice every time I'm at the bar so it really sucks that the bar across from my house I'm always treated so poorly. I don't want to say it's a race thing but from all 3 of my experiences I feel very much like i'm not wanted at this establishment. But food and drinks are always pretty good.",

I made reservations on Open Table for a Thursday but the restaurant wasn't too busy, besides the patio.\n\nThe interior is nice and would make for a great date night spot but bring a sweater - it's very cold inside!\n\nFor drinks I tried What's in Fashion and a Manhattan. Both drinks were pretty good but my Manhattan took literally 3 tries, the server kept coming back saying they don't have the rye I requested. I don't care, just make it with whatever rye you got at that point!\n\nThey had a couple of nightly specials and my bf and I got the same thing - steak, shrimp, and scallop dish served over \"risotto\" and sautéed veggies. The seafood portion was pretty good but the steak was a bit tough and undercooked for Med-Rare, more like rare. Nevertheless, the service was great and we enjoyed the experience.\n\nOverall: plenty of parking, patio, full bar, nice atmosphere (but chilly inside), great service.",

        "text": "The Woodall characterizes its atmosphere as \"sophisticated southern luxury.\" I suppose that's reasonable, though I think that they should emphasize the unique nature of their food offerings. It certainly has a strong southern tilt, but it also incorporates a number of Middle Eastern elements throughout various items on the menu.\n\nTo start: Look at the hummus. It's a white bean hummus (not chickpea) and also has some harissa/cauliflower to go alongside the laffa. This is not an option I see at southern restaurants, and I don't believe I've seen this exact combination at many Mediterranean restaurants either. I definitely liked it, though I'm admittedly not a huge hummus fan anyway.\n\nSeparately: We had two egg dishes. One was a daily special frittata (including an excellent and colorful set of green/purple leaves with citrus...something they coyly describe as \"crisp cool salad.\") Another was the shakshuka, wherein we appreciated the breadth of spices and eggplant embedded within the dish. One point to note: In this shakshuka, the eggs are not integrated into the tomato stew. Rather, it is essentially a frittata that is sitting on top of the stew. I had not seen it presented like this before, but I think the advantage is that it enables you to pick the proportions (egg:stew) to your liking...and/or to share specified components of the dish with other diners at the table.\n\nComing back to the atmosphere: The \"outside\" area is essentially enclosed with a clear tent and has sufficient heating, even in cold weather. If, however, you feel like you're sitting in a sauna, you can have someone open up a vinyl window panel to experience some fresh air.\n\nThe management team should really consider putting prices on their website menu (I never understand why they're willing to show the available dishes but then obfuscate the prices). Regardless, I'm a fan of this spot and would happily return. I get the sense that its location (Westside Village) has subtly kept it off the yuppie radar for those in Midtown/Buckhead, but I'm willing to bet that it becomes much more high profile over time.",

I ordered coffee, give me her recommendations which I appreciated. Soon she brought a big cup of coffee, perfect temperature. I don't like my coffee too hot.\n\nI ordered the calamari and a side of fries. I usually finish all my food but this time, the serving was huge, I couldn't finish and had to take home leftovers which they kindly boxed up for me.\n\nLastly, I love how the restaurant smells.

The complaint towards myself for taking so long to finally visit here!\n\nI kept telling myself I'd dine at this restaurant every time I drove by (and I drove by often). And tonight I made it happen! The entire dining experience was more than I could've expected--and I only dined on some of the smaller plates. I can't imagine how amazing the entrees are too!\n\nThe food was soooo good. And I quickly connected with the staff and would come back just to see them. I think I found my new neighborhood spot. Everything I tried was delicious, so they'd better get used to me visiting often.",

Just \"give me your name so I can clock out\" energy. Our waitress.. bless her heart.. it was clear that she was new. However.. WHERE WAS HER SUPPORT?!? We waited 30 mins for our drink that were basically water downed by the time they arrived. When I took them back to the bar... yes I took them to the bar .. the promptly remade the drinks but not before making sure the bartender was not blamed stating \"the server left it there too long\" smh. So our appetizer gets to the table. Green onions. After clearly stating an allergy\nto onions. Ok. Next appetizer came out fine. Entree. Again onions. Brought out another order that I had to pick onions out of and finally just packed it to go to give away. Finally we're over it and decided to leave. You would think the hostess would say \"thank you\" or \"goodnight\" NOOOOPE! I had to say to her \"you have a good night too\" for her to pick up her head and realize she WASNT DOING HER JOB!!! Oh... did I mention this was an anniversary celebration. Yeah. I'm done.",

He suggested I try Uncle Nearest, which I loved and he made me an amazing Old Fashioned - it was a little untraditional but really, really, really good. I don't advise it if you don't care for a sweeter drink there's a little banana liqueur in there...\n\nFor an appetizer I ordered the Calamari and Rock Shrimp - it was delicious! I was surprised to find slices of fried lemon, but that added to the appeal. \n\nIf you're ordering to go definitely get the salmon dip!\n\nFor my meal I ordered the tenderloin open face sandwich. The meat well cooked to my preference (medium) and was delectable. I chose the fries as a side and let's just say Woodall owes me nothing!\n\nWill I be back?\n\nDefinitely.",

        "text": "My husband and I were traveling through Atlanta on a Sunday and stumbled upon The Woodall. I checked out the reviews and the menu and after seeing \"Lump Crab Beignets\" this Maryland girl knew I had to give it a try. \nThe restaurant is located in Westside Village at Moores Mill complex on Marietta Boulevard in a shopping center so there is plenty of parking.   We ordered our food to go online, the process was simple and the site was easy to navigate. Our food was ready within 25 minutes of placing the order. \n\nThe staff was friendly when we picked up our order which was ready when we arrived. They offer outdoor seating and had a nice size bar with televisions.  \n\nWe ordered the Lump Crab Beignet Appetizer. Our Appetizer was very good, I didn't really taste Lump Crab meat but there was a nice Crab mixture in the middle of the fried dough. I definitely recommend and it is more than enough to share.  Both my husband and I ordered entrées of the Seared Trigger Fish. Our meals came with Basmati Fried Rice, Spinach, Lemongrass, with Hong Kong Sauce. My meal was delicious, everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection.  Another plus about The Woodall is that the prices are reasonable. \n\nI can't wait to come back to try the Butter Cake, the Beignets had way too many calories for me to try both in one visit.",

        "text": "This was my second visit here. The first time I gave it a 4 star review because the chicken dish I had wasn't up to par.  This time, I give them a 5 star review!  \n\nFirst, I had a cocktail called Bartender's choice.  You tell your server the types of cocktails you typically like and \nbased off of what you tell them, the bartender creates a drink they think you will like.  I like Uncle Nearest whiskey.  I also like lemon drop martinis.  Using that knowledge, the bartender made a DELICIOUS  cocktail that contained Pineapple juice, orange juice,  lemon juice, simple syrup, a little allspice (ALLSPICE!!!) and a drizzle of cherry syrup on top.   HONEY- you talk about something good!?!  That drink was so good I had two!  Lol\n\nWe ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizer to soak up some of the alcohol.  My friend had the watermelon salad and loved it.  I'm not a melon person so I didn't taste it.   \n\nFor dinner, I had the trigger fish with basmati fried rice. It was good!  My friend had the snapper with French fries and green beans.  We both really enjoyed our meals.  \n\nBut the BEST part (other than my cocktail) was the dessert.  The butter cake is to die for.  My friend said it was orgasmic it was so good and they could use a cigarette after eating it.  Lol.  It is good - I wouldn't say quite that good but close.  Haha.",

It was very warm out. Servers was nice, however, service was slow. We received drinks after about 20 minutes. Food came out 45 minutes after being seated. Food was just ok. Drinks were just ok. It's one of those places you visit but will be ok if you never go back again. Hubby sent the Beef Carpaccio back. Steak was cooked perfectly, but food did not come out hot. Overall, just ok. Maybe we will try brunch, but no guarantee. Inside decor and atmosphere was beautiful.",

        "text": "This is one of my new favorite restaurants in Atlanta.  I just love this place. The decor, location, staff, and bar are amazing. I've been 10 times and they are solid - never had a bad experience, even when they've been understaffed. That's saying a lot these days. \n\nI recommend making reservations because sometimes they can get busy. They are pretty easy to secure so I always book ahead. My favorites appetizer is the calamari and rock shrimp appetizer. It's fried to perfection and served with marinara. I always ask for extra. For dinner, my go-to is the triggerfish.  It's a flaky white fish, pan seared  with a wonderful sauce drizzled on top served with fried rice and spinach. I have eaten the last grain of rice off the plate on many occasions - and I wasn't the least bit embarrassed. My husband normally gets the farfalle with shrimp. I'm surely not doing this dish justice. He gets it every time and scrapes his bowl clean. You see a theme here, right? \n\nOne of the things I like most about the bar is the option to let the bartender surprise you. I've done this three times and it's like she knew me. They ask a few questions and get down to business. I haven't been disappointed yet. \n\nLastly, the staff! These are hardworking people who love what they do. One of our servers knows our order and we don't have her every time. I really appreciate that attention to detail. \n\nThis place is great for date night. Give it a try.",

        "text": "This restaurant is a welcome addition to the area. It's beautiful inside and they have a great patio and bar. The patio is enclosed in the winter and open for the warmer months. \nI've been here a couple of times and the main take away is: the food is good, but service is slow. \nMy last visit was with my hub, toddler, and 4 yo old. They do have a kids menu (everything $7.50) which is nice. I'm mad I forgot to take a pic. It has farfalle pasta with a choice or marinara, velveeta sauce, or butter (I think that's the last one); grilled or breaded chicken tenders with fries, burger with fries, or a petite filet steak with roasted veggies for an additional $4 or so. My kids had the pasta with marinara and it was very good, with big tomato chunks and garlic. \nFor appetizers we had the pigs in a blanket, which we all enjoyed. For dinner, my husband had a full portion of the cacio e Pepe and I had an appetizer portion of farfalle stroganoff and the beets appetizer. \nThe portions were weird because the cacio e Pepe seemed small for a full portion and the stroganoff seemed large for an appetizer portion; however, our bill was correct. The cacio e Pepe isn't you're typical version, this is gnocchi with lump crab, leeks, parm reggiano and other things. My hubby enjoyed and so did I. It was such as small portion so he had some of my pasta as well. The stroganoff was excellent and has short rib, Jerusalem artichoke, wild mushroom, other stuff and a dollop of creme fraiche. \nAs stated earlier, we came do an earlier dinner so it wasn't too busy. While we were quickly seated and the server was nice, service was just too slow. After our initial water refill, it took a while for anyone to check on us. A runner who brought some Of our food out, left the appetizer plates on the table without bothering to ask if she could take them for us. When dining with young kids, less on the table is better. It took a while once we're finished eating for our server to come back. What I didn't like is that there were several other servers at the computer station near us who could clearly see me repeatedly looking for our server and no one asked if we needed help. I had to take the toddler to the car while hubs waited for the server because he was getting restless. And it still took 15 additional mins for my husband to wrap the bill up. I recall service being slow the previous time I visited as well. Overall, it's a nice restaurant with nice servers but it's be nice if they were more aware of people's time and if someone needs assistance even if it's not your table. At least let the server know that their table needs help. The food is good so I'll try them again, probably for brunch and hope that the service is more attentive.",

I had flowers and a card and the waitress never asked about the special occasion. She took quite a while to take our order, which was fine but when my son got his food, there were eggs in the fried rice, and he asked if you have some fried rice without eggs. The server's response was didn't I ask you about allergies? Wow! We were shocked and no she did not ask us about allergies. And no, he could not have fried rice without eggs. The manager explained that everything is premade and it would be too much trouble to make it without the eggs. She then brought our food and my fish and rice were sitting in a salty broth. This could've been rectified, but she never came back to the table until I finally eaten the fish but not the rice because it was sitting in liquid. I also observed there was no spinach in the fried rice, which it states on the menu is in the fried rice! when I pointed it out to her, she offered to bring me some spinach. Really? The manager took nine dollars off the check.  I called later on to let her know everything that had happened and she was patronizing and defensive. And made excuses for the server. Let's be clear if she's your best server you got a problem.",
