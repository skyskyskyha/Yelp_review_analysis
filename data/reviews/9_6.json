        "text": "We've been passed #BonTonAtlanta quite a few times on our way to Papi's but this time it was our 6 year old who made the decision for us to try it and we have to give her credit because it was a good decision. She wanted to have an \"outdoor picnic\" and their ability to have #outdoordining made the choice very easy. In this #Covid19 dining era we are in a restaurants ability to offer #outdoordining year round can add so much to a customers dining experience. \n\nLet me first start by saying the The Frozen Ward Six Cup on ice was EVERYTHING! I'm not sure why I played myself and ordered a small. Probably because I wasn't sure if I was going to like it but when I ordered my 2nd one I should have ordered a LARGE! We started off with some #CornNuggets which had a sweet taste that we all enjoyed. I decided to have the Gumbo dinner for 2 because I knew I would want to take the rest home for later. The gumbo had good flavor but I wish it had more seafood in it. My husband had the Cajun Shrimp Burger. For my daughter they did not have a kids menu so we ordered her Fried Chicken and Fries. We thought she would take some home but she liked it so much that she ate it all and kept reminding us that it was HER chicken. Service was decent, a little slow in some areas but all in all a great \"outdoor picnic\" that Kenzie requested and some great cocktails for me.",

So on the day that I visited my friend and I were restaurant hopping (I food blog @ the hungry_fashionista_atl on IG).  So we were excited to try this place. So have to order and pay at the counter before you were seated. Once we were seated we were sorta forgotten about. It was only about 5 people in the restaurant at the time we went. We got our  food before  we even got anything to drink. We had to ask for water and silverware on separate occasions so that was a little frustrating. Me and my friend ordered the shrimp burger, fried shrimp banh mi and sweet potato fries. Everything was really good but the shrimp burger is a must try!  All the flavors from it are to die for. \n\nFood excellent. Service ok.",

        "text": "This was my first time out since social distancing guidelines have been put in place, and I will say this restaurant did a pretty good job at enforcing this. Upon entry into the restaurant, you have to wear a masks when entering. They also offer hand sanitizer to guests as well. I had mine own mask, but they even give away masks to customers for free which I appreciated. There's a limited capacity enforced so we had to wait to be seated but not too long, maybe 10 minutes of that. We ordered our food & drinks at the front and then we were seated. \n\nThe restaurant has an eclectic feel which I thought was cool, nicely decorated. I ordered the a rum punch type of drink and it was pretty good! My friends and I agreed that the drinks were pretty strong so that was a plus. For my meal I ordered the shrimp po boy with sweet potato fries and I was so impressed! The last time I've had a po boy was in New Orleans and this one definitely made me feel nostalgia. The shrimp was seasoned and fried perfectly. They even added powdered sugar to the sweet potato fries which I've never had before but the combo actually tasted really good so it was a cute bonus. I also tried my friends mac and cheese which was really savory (with gouda cheese I think).\n\nOverall I really liked my dining experience here and I would totally visit again!",

I went seeking the shrimp po-boy and hush puppies. Right off the bat, I was very pleased with the service I received from the young staff in the front of the house. They were so kind and accommodating. I ordered a shrimp po-boy and an order of the hush puppies. The sandwich was yummy but the best thing were the hush puppies. They absolutely hit those out of the park. They were delicious and addicting. Next time I'm in Atlanta I would stop by Bon Ton specifically for these.

        "text": "The Ambiance / Setting.\n\nBon Ton is such a unique spot to have a meal, the building is pink and the indoor seating is decorated beautifully. a mix between classy and eclectic in atmosphere. It's always an absolute pleasure having a meal here. I've never received rude or bad service and I can hardly ever help myself when I look at the menu. I end up having a full course. \n\nThe Food \n\nIf you are looking for food with unwavering quality , RUN don't walk here. I was a bit suspicious of the crawfish dishes because I am louisiana born and ate it a lot growing up but they did my favorite seafood JUSTICE. The Étouffée is a must. I'm almost tempted to gate keep this meal because last time it got popular the restaurant ran out twice while I was hoping to dine there! The fried crawfish basket is so good and honestly I had to stop myself from finishing it all because I had no more space and I was hoping for some late night left overs ! Additionally their dessert is always good. They have a \"daily special\" I guess you could call it but it's been good so far ! \n\nSandwiches / Drinks \n\nThe sandwiches are delicious i've tried the crawfish and shrimp options you can't go wrong. The drinks are amazing and here's why: If you want a mock tail and you can explain the flavor you're going for the bar tender will make something for you ! I've had my fair share of bad experiences when it comes to trying to order a mock tail of sorts at an establishment who couldn't be less concerned with its non-drinking customers. However Bon Ton  and it's staff happily obliged and provided us with drinks after I essentially said \"something guava ..something sweet maybe ?\" and they made a delicious peach flavored drink ! love it. \n\nService \nThe waiters are so courteous and kind i've never been treated poorly at this restaurant. If you get Alex TIP BIG. Amazing waiter each time ! definitely deserved",

        "text": "Wow! This is my second day in a row trying the unique flavors here at Bon Ton. The atmosphere is lively and both the outside and inside are cute. Spaces fill up quickly, so be prepared to make a reservation in advance if you plan on sitting indoors. It seems like it's easier to sit outside, as we were able to walk up and get a table relatively quickly. \n\nI ordered the BonTon rice bowl with fried catfish and it was delicious. I get it every time and it is consistently impressive. Today, I ordered the same thing but with the Vietnamese meatballs. It was incredible! The sauces on the side are flavorful and robust. I have never been disappointed with anything on the menu and the drinks are yummy too. \n\nI only took off a star because the service can be slow. I had to ask for our waiter a few times and the check. However, they were very kind when they came to our table. It gets busy here and I imagine they are short-staffed in this economy. Definitely give them a try!",

Theres no big sign so you gotta know where its at, there a small diary book sized sign with the resturants name on it near the door. The young lady that took my order was super rude as if I was bothering her by placing a to go order. I ordered the crawfish basket and the food came out quick. The portion size was small, I got 10 times more fries then crawfish, smallest hushpuppies I ever seen and like the other comments say a little heavy handed on the salt.",

Crabcakes were mushy and was there crab? I couldn't tell. \n\nThe blackened catfish banh mi was flavorful, but fish was not fresh: it was soft, and not the firm texture that fresh catfish should be. \nThey have a dedicated parking lot which is great since it's downtown.",

Not knowing this, I also tipped my server. Again, shame on me for not being more alert, but I will NOT be returning anytime soon. Rather a shame because the seasoning was actually not bad.

This restaurant replaced another restaurant that I used to frequent some years back and after my first visit here I decided I would be back. \n\nParking is not the best, there is a parking lot for  this restaurant but it fills up fast if they are busy. There is also street Parking for a fee till 10pm in front of the restaurant. Do not park in the neighborhood if you don't live there and have a permit, there are signs and your car will get a boot if you park in a permit zone only area.\n\nThe ambiance is eclectic and fun, definitely different from any restaurant I've been to in Atlanta. The music was up beat and everyone seems to have a good time here.\n\nDue to the long wait for a table my 2 companions and I were seated at the bar. I had a Margarita and one of my friends ordered a specialty drink which looked like a snowball. There is a vast selection of drinks, and they were good. I ordered the shrimp burger which is kinda small and comes alone with no sides added so if you are hungry I would suggest adding sides. My shrimp burger was the best I've had to date, it was so flavorful and everything on it paired perfectly. We ordered sides to share, the mac and cheese, five spice broccoli,  and garlic green beans. The veggies were fresh and seasoned to perfection, in yummy sauces. Not sure why the rave reviews on the mac and cheese but I thought it was ok. \n\nIf you are looking for a cool place to meet up with friends or to bring a date, look no further.  I can't wait to get back here.",

Although the website hadn't been updated, they are open for business.\n\nCame on a Friday night and it was a safe dining experience. The ambience is definitely New Orleans style. They had a great music selection. The only drawback for me was it was too dark for dining. I like to see my food.  The service was great.  Our server Kevin made great recommendations from their drink menu. My dining partner had their New Orleans Hurricane. It looked great but I didn't try it.\n\nWe ordered their fried seafood basket and we were not disappointed. The catfish and oysters were fried and seasoned to perfection. They give you a great amount of food.\n\nWe tried dessert but I didn't really like it. It looked as though it would have been an apple pie but the texture and topping made it mushy.\n\nThis would be a fun girls night out spot. They have the vibe to make it fun.",

There is a small parking lot behind the restaurant, it was full the day we went. (Fat chance parking there)\n\nCreative and fun place with a menu to match. We came once for dinner and once for weekend brunch. Mostly seafood with cajun flavors and some Vietnamese items. They offer a couple of vegetarian items as well. \n\nFor brunch we both had a bloody mary and they were very good and I highly recommend them. I had the Bahn Mi omelette. My partner had a breakfast bowl. My bahn mi was excellent. My partner loved his breakfast bowl as well. \n\nGreat service, great food, parking is challenging, great drinks.",

        "text": "I had a taste for some seafood so I went on this application on my phone by the name of \"Yelp\" and got ta searching and this established popped up. I checked out some pics and quickly decided that it looked like my type of vibe.\n\nI walked in and looked at the bar and was quickly asked if I had a reservation, which I did not. The wait time was forty minutes which wasn't bad at all especially since I could already taste the food in my mind. They took my phone number and I proceeded to wait on the phone call to come partake in the consumption of some grub.\n\nOnce I received the call I was seated in what I would call the back of the restaurant. No issues there, I was just ready for the meal. Once I saw the menu I immediately opted for the Mac and Cheese add Crawfish, yes CRAWFISH and a Banh Mi Shrimp Poboy. Listen. This food was the bomb, the shiznit, and whatever other superlatives you can come up with. I have never thought about combining Mac and Cheese and Crawfish but they really came up with a winner with that one. The Banh Mi Shrimp Poboy wasn't far behind. It was sweet and spicy at the same, damn, time. I loved the Jalapeno peppers, aioli, cilantro and a few other ingredients to this glorious dish. I don't want to advise you to try it, but, you know.\n\nSimple restaurant, simple menu, but big flavor. I like.",

        "text": "I had my reservations about what a Vietnamese and Cajun infusion experience would be like. It was not disappointing at all. The dining space is small but remarkably workable. We were seated at a 2-by next to the large window but didn't really feel like we were in the way of passing traffic. It's a great seat. Affords a nice view of the local Atlanta neighborhood.\n\nI had a blackened catfish banh mi which was great. Creamy and spicy. Hit all the right notes. I had a side of rice and beans, too. It was pretty good. I'm glad I went with the half sandwich because it was all very filling.\n\nI think the real highlight, at least for me, was the poutine. Not your traditional Canadian variety. It's served as charbroiled sweet potato fries, which gives a great sweet and smoky profile. The andouille gravy just takes it right up. I loved it... but it's rich. You'll feel it.\n\nAnyway, nice spot. They even have a little parking lot.",

        "text": "I went with a party of 3 on the Monday before Christmas for the Sippin' Santa pop-up at 7:00 pm. We were going to eat dinner at Bon Ton, but there was an hour and a half wait, so we walked to Torched Hop to eat dinner and then walked back to Bon Ton to get drinks. The only downside is that when we put our names on the waitlist, they wouldn't take our phone number to text us. They told us a wait time, but we had to be there in person to see if our table was ready. Maybe it's different when it's not Sippin' Santa?\n\nWe got the Papa Noel, Festivus Flip, and Shaka Kalikimaka. All were amazing!! My favorite was the Papa Noel. We also tried the Christmas Eve of Destruction, but it was heavy on the nutmeg, so stay away if you're not a fan of nutmeg.\n\nThey go all out with the decorations for Christmas. It is so festive. There are lights everywhere. Even the bathroom is decorated! The pens for signing the checks are candy canes. They seriously thought of every detail.\n\nI'm sad that we didn't get any food because I've heard amazing things. So I'll definitely be back to try the food and get the complete Bon Ton experience.",

It's cool!) and a small bar area\n\nService/Waiter: I forgot his name, but he was really awesome when it came to recommendations and making sure we were good (short black guy w/ dreads)\n\nFood: we had the Crab claws as an appetizer and that sauce and crab was sooooooooo good!!!!  Omgggg and for my main meal I had crab legs, hush puppies, & the crawfish Mac n cheese and everything on my plate was GREAT!!!! As for my fiancé, his PO boy was \"ok\" it was more bread than filling. The drinks was kinda weak (alcohol wise) but the cups/garnishes was cute!\n\nWill I come again? I would bring my out of town friends here to try, but me?

Loved how boldly garlicky and spicy their string beans side was and their corn fritters were worth every golden calorie. The pound of steamed snow crab legs were abundantly filled with sweet crab meat and the boiled crawfish had a right amount of spice and were nice size too. Their steamed Mussels were plump and plentiful as well and loved how massive their crab cakes entree was. Oh and they have the most addictive French fries!!!! \n\nSadly their slushy machine was out of order, so even though I could not try their frozen Vietnamese coffee concoction, their regular Vietnamese coffee was still very good.\n\nWill definitely be back!!",

This restaurant used to be Top Flr, if I'm not mistaken. I hadn't realized until GPS guided me here. Parking is still as bad (on a Saturday night) as ever but I found some street parking nearby. \n\nWe sat at the bar since we weren't planning on staying long. I ordered the crawfish Mac and cheese and my friend ordered the crab cake app. And since I was feeling a little warm from my walk from my parking spot a whiles away, I ordered a large frozen ward six cup, which comes in a cool color changing cup based on the temperature of the cup. It's only available in the large, and if I remember correctly, if you bring the cup back in during your next visit, you get a slight discount on a \"refill.\" \n\nThe Frozen Ward Six Cup is sweet and tasty but also very potent thanks to that vodka! I also really liked how rich and decadent the savory smoked Gouda crawfish Mac and cheese was! Crab cake was also pretty flavorful, although nothing mind blowing. \n\nI definitely want to come back for some real food at some point, because it was so hard settling on just two appetizers and one drink!",

        "text": "Bon Ton is a unique and interesting restaurant and bar. It's a combination of New Orleans, Louisiana style, Cajun/Creole, Vietnamese, seafood, and tiki bar all rolled into one. There's nothing else quite like it in Atlanta. This is a trendy and hip place. When it comes down to it, the food and service are very good. I had a great time here.\n\nBon Ton was created by the owners of Midtown's The Lawrence (New American, contemporary Southern) and the owner of Buford Highway's Crawfish Shack Seafood (Cajun seafood, Vietnamese), hence the fusion of culinary styles. The restaurant opened in February 2017. It replaced Top Flr which closed in November 2015 (https://bit.ly/2RRqsin).\n\nThe business shares a parking lot with Papi's. When we showed up for lunch on a Saturday at 12pm, there were several open spots. However, the lot filled up quick. Multiple people were looking for/waiting on spots when we left. Street parking is available in the immediate vicinity, but you'll want to pay attention to street signs to make sure you can park on certain stretches at certain times.\n\nThe restaurant is stylish and has a hipster vibe. The business has a distinct, solid-pink-colored exterior. Inside, there's a cool retro-looking bar and a dining room that glows red from the restaurant's often-photographed \"Fancy Service\" neon sign. Even their Instagram account goes against the grain with all sorts of weird posts: https://www.instagram.com/bontonatlanta/.\n\nStarters ($4-14 each) run the gamut from sweet and spicy cold noodles ($7) to charbroiled poutine ($8). Like standard Cajun seafood restaurants, they feature raw oysters (described as \"artisan Gulf oysters,\" 6 for $14 or 12 for $26), boiled seafood and fried seafood. Boiled seafood is sold at market price at includes crawfish, snow crab, king crab, mussels, clams, and jumbo shrimp. Fried seafood runs anywhere from $10-11 for a single order to $19-22 for a double, +$4 for a basket with Cajun fries and hush puppies.\n\nThey offer sandwiches too, but more than just po' boys. They've got crab cake sandwiches ($14), Nashville hot oyster rolls ($14), banh mis (Vietnamese sandwiches) like the blackened catfish banh mi and the spicy shrimp banh mi (half $8, whole $12), and more. There are also entrees like smoked snow crab and a $99 \"Crabstravaganza\" that comes with over 3 pounds of shellfish plus sausage and sides.\n\nThere's only one lunch special. It consists of half a house po' boy, chips, and soda for $10. When we visited, the brunch menu was offered. It had several interesting items like the Vietnamese pancake banh xeo ($8) and a Chinese five spice shrimp and grits ($15). They have quite the drink menu too with all sorts of cocktails, beer, and wine plus a few interesting non-alcoholic beverages too.\n\nHere's what we had:\n\n* Vietnamese iced coffee ($5 each) - chicory coffee cold brew, sweetened condensed milk, coconut cream powder, bitters\n* Lo lat rolls ($8) - aromatic ground beef, betel leaves\n* Artisan Gulf oysters served with fancy mignonette (dozen for $26)\n* Smoked Gouda mac & cheese ($5)\n* Moules frites ($18) - 1 lb. mussels, bacon, shallots, onion, cilantro, basil, lemon, Cajun fries\n* Vietnamese omelet banh mi ($8) - savory herb omelet, toasted baguette, pickled vegetables, cilantro, fresh jalapenos\n* Fried hand pie ($5)\n* King cake\n\nOverall, I enjoyed everything. Everything was tasty and there wasn't a single bad item. My favorites were the lo lat rolls, oysters, and Vietnamese omelet banh mi. The king cake for dessert was pretty awesome too (no baby inside though).\n\nThe lo lat rolls were terrific. They were small (supposed to be) and packed with savory flavor. They were topped with cilantro, spring onion, crushed peanuts, and black and white sesame seeds, and served with a side of nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce) with red pepper flakes.\n\nThe Gulf oysters were great. They tasted fresh and clean with a mild brine. Two of the oysters had baby crabs on them - something I've never seen in all my years of eating raw oysters. This wasn't a big deal to us. The oysters were replaced with three new oysters so we ended up getting a baker's dozen.\n\nThe Vietnamese omelet banh mi was a bit messy to eat, but very delicious. It was basically an omelet sandwich with the flavor profile of a traditional banh mi. Buttery and satisfying. Unlike some banh mis which utilize a hard baguette, this banh mi had pretty soft bread.\n\nIf you like mussels, order the moules frites (mussels and fries). It's fantastic. The mussels were fine quality and served in a rich sauce that was so yummy and addictive that almost anything went well dipped in it, even the fries. The fries were thick-cut and filling; the Cajun seasoning flavorful.\n\nI recommend the king cake if they have it and the fried hand pie too. The latter had a wonderfully flaky pastry crust and a sweet and delectable filling. As for the Vietnamese coffee, it was OK. It wasn't the best I've had, but it served its purpose. It's worth ordering.",

        "text": "Hip happy friendly vibes ooze throughout this place. I am writing this after visiting it a couple of times. We sat at the bar and had fantastic service and food the first time we were here, the second time we came it was just ok service and food. Hence the four stars instead of five. Yes, it was obvious enough of a difference that I would have update my review. \n\nI'm only going to write about the first visit as I only have pics for it. I began the evening with a tasty old fashioned. It was really good, but not my usual adventurous drink picks so for my next drink I had the frozen Ward Six Cup and I was oh so happy I made the switch. I love my old fashion, but with a cocktail menu as cool as this one I should be ashamed of myself. \n\nWe arrived very hungry. We started with the crab cake and pickled vegetable app. It was ALL crab meat and so so tasty. We had a hard time picking our sandwiches so got two halves. I appreciate the option of halves instead of whole sandwiches. The halves (seemed like more than 6 inches) are very large and so I can't imagine a whole sandwich; it must be massive. We got the cauliflower falafel Banh-Mi and Blackened Catfish Banh-Mi. The Blackened catfish was our flavorite!  At some point in time I want to try the cajun shrimp burger, Nashville hot oyster and house Po-boy catfish or shrimp sandwich. They have a lot of delicious side options, but if you have read any of my reviews then you know I will ALWAYS pick mac and cheese. Your belly will be very happy if you get the smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese, too. I want to try so many of their side, but I was very satisfied with the m&c.  \n\nI will continue to visit this place until I have tried all I can. Thanks for making ATL's food scene more delicious and creative.",

Let me just say, if you're a tourist visiting and considering going to Mary Mac's please just go to Bon Ton.\n\nParking: don't tell anyone else, but parking on the right side of Myrtle street is free (past 3rd street, I think). The neighborhood is walk-able so it'll be okay to park even past 4th until 5th street and walk to Bon Ton.  \n\nSome others have noted the price point, but I feel like the food/drink quality is up to par with the price and it's also competitive with restaurants in the area.",

I've never has crawfish before so i was excited to try it!\n\nOmg the food was AMAZING Had the boiled peanuts to start followed by char grilled oysters yumm So seasoned with butter and cheese total mouthgasm. Next i had the mixed greens salad and a crab cake appetizer, basically the size of a small pancake! \n\nOnly one downside was our waitress was a little distracted and informed us that the drink with a shorty combo wasn't available, even though we saw a few other tables doing it. \n\nBut the smoked crab was incredible ! Never tasted flavors  like that before... must try for seafood lovers !!",

I highly recommend sitting at the bar. You get a great show and I was able to ask about all of their house made liquors. They have several liquors that they infuse for their drinks to make them unique and unlike other restaurants or bars in the area. The bartenders were so amazing!!!! Had so much fun by myself. I was actually glad I could enjoy everything without others being there with me. I ordered the shrimp burger which had chunks of shrimp in it and the flavor was incredible. I began to eat all of the fries first so I wouldn't destroy the burger too quickly. My drink of choice you ask....remember I love bourbons and whiskeys so I ordered the smoked bourbon mai tai. I thought it would have a deeper flavor but it was very refreshing and ended up being very tasty. I loved the entire experience. It was more than fancy service for sure.",

I'm a big fan of Miracle on Monroe for the holiday cocktails but Bon Ton takes the lead with the food. Everything I ate was absolutely delicious and perfectly seasoned. \n\nI loved the tiki Santa theme and the place was very cheesy decorated which was fantastic, it reminded me of being in the bar in fear and loathing in Las Vegas but much more vibrant. The music was great, comfy booths to sit in that are very roomy, cool vibe, nice servers and very nice tunes playing. \n\nI tried one of the holiday cocktails and it was fruity and delicious. I ordered a small shrimp basket with fries and it also came with 2 hush puppies. I was very surprised by the size, it was so filling and the shrimp were very large. Every item in that basket had flavor....oh my gosh, it was so good!!\n\nThe holiday pop up bars are leaving until next year but I will definitely be back at Bon Ton before that time to try more of their menu items. \n\nOh yeah, can't forget, I sampled the mac n cheese with crawfish and it was AMAZING. Love that they used shell noodles and it definitely had a cajun kick to it.",

I also did the Bon Ton Hurricane which came with a New Orleans style snocone scoop on top - perfection. \n\nWe started food with the Lo Lot Rolls($8.00) which were gluten-free little cigar rolls of aromatic ground beef inside betel leaves. \n\nI finished with amazing Moules Frites ($18.00) which is 1 pound of mussels in this rich bath of bacon, shallots, onion, cilantro, basil, and lemon with a bowl of cajun fries. Yes, sir that was delicious. \n\nCome early or super late it's a tiny place. So worth it. It's good times at the Bon Ton.",

        "text": "On July 21st my husband and I went to bon ton and the manager at the time (Bryce) charged our card and told us and we say the payment removed on our account however he informed us there was an issue on their end so for us to swipe again, and that the payment should fall off. Days go by and the payment had not fallen off. At this point weeks go by we contact Bryce and he told us that he would contact someone to get the issue resolved, he never did. We reached out two weeks later to no avail he never responded to email neither be reached by phone. I then got in contact with Britni Moore who is the other manager and informed her on what was going on. She then reassured me that she would let Bryce know since he was originally handling the situation. Again to no avail it was not resolved. I emailed her once more only for her to never respond. I then proceeded to call the establishment spoke with an employee who then connected me to Britni and she told me that Bryce no longer worked there, sketch but ok. She then proceeded to say that she would get in contact with their accountant to have issue resolved. You guessed it nothing happened. To this day the situation has not been resolved. We were charged $150 twice due to an issue on their end. And again this all took place July 21st I've emailed both Bryce and Britni the receipt and have proof of both of them confirming that they would take care of yet they have not. So to sum it up, was I scammed by the managers of this establishment possibly so.",

For drinks the Mai Tai. It wasn't my favorite. I got the 1/2 Bon Ton Banh Mi with fried shrimp and a side of fries. It was yummy. The shrimps were small but many. If I came again, I would probably not get any drinks and get the whole banh mi or house po'boy.",
