                "text": "5Church disappointed me last month with their brunch. We met up with another couple for a post-holiday recap and had a mixed experience. We were all late thanks to Kamala coming to town for the Peach Bowl and thankfully 5Chruch was incredibly accommodating of our reservation, even though we were 15-20 min late. \nWe ordered fast to accommodate the waitress and the next reservation, but unfortunately, this is where things turned sour. I ordered a French omelet as my meal and the omelet was certainly not a French omelet by style alone. Don't characterize an item as a specific style unless your chefs can cook it! The omelet was bland, overcooked for the style, my potatoes were both cold and rock hard, and it was forgotten at first. The waitress brought me someone else's meal and put my omelet on another table. I immediately called attention to this, they took the meal off my table and went to the back of the restaurant to sort it out. I then saw the waitress take my omelet off someone's table and put it in front of me. That's a huge health violation to add to the issue of my food being technically wrong and incorrectly cooked (potatoes). After expressing my upset the staff took my meal away, but not before everyone else at my table was done eating. I asked that the meal be taken off the bill and it was. \nThe only catch though? They added a double bourbon shot onto our tab that my husband and friend didn't notice until we got home. So they took off my $18 omelet and added on a $24 drink! \n\nI will not come back here ever again. I'm sure these were all honest mistakes but there were too many issues to overlook and spend my money here again for a redo.",

Eh.\n\nThey had the four course meal situation that me and three of my friends decided to do.\nIt was $110 pp for the four course and a bottle of wine. \nWe also wanted to pay the extra $50 for the unlimited drinks, dj and etc.\n\nOur reservation was for 10pm. We got there at 9:55 and had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. They said it's because the other tables went passed their limit. The staff should have either been working on schedule to make sure the courses come out on time or telling the table to get up after their allotted time. I hate making reservations when I still have to wait. After complaining they tell us that they have complimentary champagne... I didn't like that we had to complain to be told that.\n\nIt's freezing outside. They advertised that they had coat check. The coat rack could only hold like 10 jackets so we  were stuck with our jackets the entire night. \n\nthe server was running around and talking so fast we could barely understand what he was saying. \n2 of the courses were good but that was it. Not really worth the money. The lamb chops were amazing. \nWe were instructed to let the server know at the end of our dinner that we wanted to go to the garden room area so he could add the $50 to our tabs. \nThis is when he says that the are is full and we can't go in but he still gave us bands to enjoy drinks at the outside bar. we eventually got in. \n\nI'm sorry ... I like all different kinds of music but the DJ just wasn't hitting. Like corny music. Definitely missing the mark. I felt like he wanted people to leave. People were heading out shortly after the ball dropped. They had a makeshift bar in the garden room area that made me feel like I was at my high school prom. I feel like the midtown location would've been better in this aspect because they have an actual bar on the rooftop. \n\nThe bathrooms were disgusting. I don't know if it was toilet water or what but the floors were wet and gross! \n\nI would also suggest if you're going to go to this event for 2025, book an early table. \n\nI know that these events can invite a bigger crowd and things can happen but definitely try to practice better time management in all departments so that the experience can be smooth for customers.",

I went with a big group and got to try a bunch of things:  the salmon appetizer (amazing!), the land and sea plate (the pork belly to die for and the scallops were perfectly cooked), the filet with mushrooms (absolutely on point), broccoli (it had a little kick), and Brussels sprouts (delish).  For desert I had the banana cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was insanely decadent.  They nailed EVERYTHING!  Very memorable meal.",

My family decided to give the Buckhead location a try to celebrate my sister's birthday over brunch. When making the reservation there are options on which area in the restaurant you'd like to dine so we selected the sunroom and it did not disappoint. \n\nWe valeted for parking. I'm not sure if there were other options available. When we arrived we were seated in the sunroom promptly. Our waitress was very sweet, gave thorough recommendations and was very attentive to our party. The sunroom decor was stunning that was enhanced by the beautiful sunlight. There was great music playing but I was glad it wasn't too loud so you can enjoy brunch comfortably. \n\nWe stared with mimosas and manmosas (champagne, beer and orange juice). For our entrees we ordered the steak and eggs, chicken and waffle, banana French toast and breakfast potatoes. My husband enjoyed how the steak was cooked and marinated. The chicken was seasoned very well with the perfect portioned waffle. And my Mom and sister both loved their French toast and potatoes. \n\nThe restaurant does not do courtesy birthday dessert. We ordered a cheesecake for the birthday girl that was just okay. Overall we enjoyed our food and had a great experience, will definitely dine here again.",

Parking is tight, but valet is complimentary and you can tip what you like.\n\nThis 5Church seems smaller and they decor is brighter and more airy. The outside area is beautiful, adorned with pretty flowers and plants--like a garden! We wanted to sit out there, but there wasn't anymore space.\n\nOur server (Myron I think) was fantastic. He gave us recommendations, made sure our orders were correct when they arrived at the table, and everything else. He really elevated the experience!\n\nI ordered the biscuits and gravy and a pineapple mimosa. The biscuit was assembled like a sandwich and came with a side of fruit, potatoes, and pimento cheese. It was pretty good. My friends got the burger and fries, which they loved.\n\nI would definitely recommend, and I'll definitely be back!",

There also was not enough naan served alongside the bone marrow to use as a full spread. The smoked salmon was really good, but a funky flavor. It could have done without the cucumber lime water. There were too many flavors occurring at the same time. So beware if you're weird with food! The banana cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and cheesecake were excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed both of those flavors. \n\nBuyer beware, a $50 service charge per person is required when dining out here. It is waved as long as the bill is $50/person.",

I got the wagyu burger which from the description sounded amazing, but honestly it was underwhelming. I was in a party of 3 and when my food came the burger was not warm l and the fries were cold. I asked for new fries and Just stuck with the burger although I should have sent it back. Unfortunately, not impressed and the service was slow (45 or more mins for food when it was empty, 15 mins to come back to get the check). They even came and provided complimentary hummus because they knew the food was taking forever and still came out cold. Maybe it was an off night but not sure I would recommend.",

When the mimosas finally arrived they were warm. I couldn't even drink it. Gross. \n\nNext, we ordered chicken and waffles. It took an hour to get the chicken and waffles! The place wasn't even that busy. The food was mediocre at best. \n\nNo apologies for the bad service and then they had the audacity to charge 20% gratuity. \n\nNeedless to say next time I come to ATL I definitely won't be back at this establishment!",

Pretty decor - and not the cheap trendy TikTok look - classy business up in here ok? \n-Complimentary valet \n-Mimosas are just $6! I had the grapefruit one, which sounds very typical and unimpressive, but somehow it's the most delicious mimosa I've ever had?! So I got another one. \n-Girl, the bartender was so friendly, charming and accommodating I almost asked the man for his phone number!

We had a table in the sunroom which was elegant and wonderfully decorated- definitely instagram worthy! \n\nOur server Darry was AMAZING- she was so nice, attentive, and swift. The food was a 10! The biscuits and gravy were flavorful and fresh. The waffle was fluffy yet crispy and the hot syrup was perfect.

The waiter was very charismatic, and continue to check on us frequently. They were very knowledgeable on the menu and even recommended great drinks.\n\n Drinks\nYour cocktail, queen stamps her approval on the delicious drinks served here! The fresh, quality ingredients paired with your favorite choice in liquor will dance on your taste buds. This is definitely the kind of place that you come to grab quality a drink. \n\n Food\nI wasn't a fan of the food. The charcuterie board was the best part of the food experience. The variety of things on the board was absolutely exciting and flavorsome. However, I didn't prefer a leg quarter, and did not know that was the part of the chicken that would be prepared. It was prepared with a teriyaki like sauce, on a bed of steam bok choy, with peeled carrot pieces. It was a disappointing combination! I was left eating my sides. I won't say the whole menu is disappointing but I wouldn't choose this particular dish.",

I ordered the eggs Benedict with cured salmon (with potatoes) and my partner and his Dad French Omelette, which was equally good. Mostly because his Dad has dentures and needed soft type of food. But he said even the potatoes were soft, so just keep in mind that anything potatoes is soft. But also the ambient of the place was nice and not to mention the patio looked cool! I wasn't sure if that would've been too hot. We were served by an awesome waiter, which sadly I don't know his name. But if he's reading this thank you so much! You made celebrating my partner's Dad's birthday an awesome start.",

This place did not live up to the hype from social media. \n\nHad reservations and was seated within a few minutes. The waitress came over and she was nice but throughout service was forgetful and not attentive. \n\nI ordered steak and eggs and it was ok. Very subpar. I wanted a side of toast and was told they don't have toast on the side. They also ran out of french toast apparently. That was not a good look. I ordered a pineapple mimosa and it was ok as well. I ordered another one and had to ask the waitress for it after waiting a while. She stated oh yeah, it's at the bar. Clearly she just was not keeping up with things. \n\nMy friend ordered fries with her  meal and it never came however was on the bill. Another table came after us and got their food immediately and their fries were there for them. They seem to have known the manager. The same manager who was walking around to specific tables acknowledging them and never did for our table despite their mishaps with service.\n\nWe were a table of 3 and gratuity of 20% was already added. When that happens establishments should provide proper service and in this case that was not shown here. \n\n5 church was not worth the trip. Their outside patio was empty and that's probably because they charge to sit out there. That is unnecessary.",

Def a pretty place to take pictures. \nValet works off tips, which makes you want to tip them even more.\n\nThe drink we ordered was the red sangria carafe which was really good! Not sweet, slightly bitter, but still good! \n\nThe food unfortunately was okay. Our food came out slightly cool. Like it was sitting. I ordered the crawfish and grits, the flavors were so good! But this place also gives you really small portions which I do not favor for how much you pay.  The bowl was so big, when you go in to take a bite of the grits, the picture is exactly what it is. You're already scraping the bottom of the plate.... The grits were cooked well and the crawfish had a great flavor to it.\n\nMy friend liked her food as well, not sure what it was called, but it was slightly on the cooler side as well. \n\nOur fries were not great, they came out cool and kind of hard. \n\nI would not come back here to eat, but I would definitely come for the drinks.",

I'd keep the parking in mind as there isn't street parking in the area and the lot is small, but there is complimentary valet! If you decide to get a ride to and from it just opens you up for their drink menu.\n\nLets start on drinks, first they have an extensive wine menu, as well as a full bar. Their specialty cocktails are unique, but they also are limited, so if you're picky on your alcohol and mixed drinks you might be better off ordering a basic cocktail or a glass of wine. Personally I would like to see them fill out more gin cocktails, but they just need to add more to their specialty drinks all around. \n\nFood is the talk of the town here, and my god was it worth talking about. We started our meal off with the Bone Marrow to share, and then got the Veal Chop and a Filet Mignon. We had an abundance of sides, probably more than we needed to order. The Bone Marrow was a perfect starter, with the rich meat and pickled vegetables it opened our tastes buds and set us up for the rest of the menu. My Veal Chop (first time having veal) was amazing, on a bed of polenta super delicious. The Filet Mignon we ordered with Foie Gras, and that literally melted in your mouth, I would go back and order this more than once a week if I could handle all that red meat. All of our sides were delicious, but again we ended up with way too much food. \n\nOf course we got the tiramisu to end our meal, and while it hit the spot, it was not the best tiramisu I have ever had, next time I think I will opt for the Banana creme brulee.",

                "text": "See PSA at end. \n\nMade a reservation to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday on a Saturday night. Was called about a week before saying that there was a party who booked out the venue and that we would have to change the time or the day of our reservation. Although it wasn't ideal because of other plans we had made for that weekend, we were flexible and changed our reservation for Friday. We were booked in the sun room which is absolutely beautiful and had a great waiter who explained the art in the room and through the restaurant. The food and drinks we got were delicious (didn't get it all pictured) with flavors that I couldn't recreate in my kitchen if I tried a thousand times. Overall a very pleasant experience. \n\n!! However, I would like to leave a little information for future patrons because we were never told this when booking or when rebooking our reservations, that there is an expected $75 per person minimum in the sun room. I think that's a fair price and I have no complaints about paying that in the future but it was just awkward to be told this expectation after our meal and when we were handed the check (and we weren't far off that $). \n\nHappy dining! Recommended for date night.",

                "text": "I'm in love with this place! On todays food adventure I went to check out 5 Church Buckhead. Starting off the restaurant has 2 looks. The indoor looks as though you're inside a whimsical dark fairy tail. The walls are painted black with passages written from books in white ink and there is floral trees with beautiful light features throughout the venue. The outside is designed as a green house with lots of white flowers and trees. One would say good and evil, choose wisely.  We choose the the outdoor area, please take into consideration that there is a $150 minimum if you choose outdoors. [Don't know why is required vs the inside, but not hard to reach]\n\nWe started off with a couple cocktails. I recommend Egress and the Sun Tzu.  Appetizers wise, we ordered the Bone Marrow and Land & Sea. Not a fan of the Cured Salmon, not enough flavor in my opinion. As for food their menu is all delicious. The Cacio E Pepe is super yummy and we also got the Prime Ribeye. Our server truly made the experience delightful by being animated and giving good costumer service. \n\nThey have complimentary valet parking, like I always say this is a huge plus in my books. I would highly recommend putting this on your food adventure list. Is definitely worth the visit. Let your taste buds live their best life.",

We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your time at 5Church Buckhead and that our sunroom was perfect for pictures and aesthetics.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by the parking situation, as we understand it can be challenging in that area. Our complimentary valet service is something our guests love, but for those who prefer to self park, we do offer self-parking options below the restaurant which is mentioned on our website and also OpenTable page when you make the reservation.\n\nWe appreciate your visit and would love to welcome you back to our restaurant in the future. It would be great to have a chance to show you our Midtown location as well and make a comparison.\n\nThank you again for your feedback and we hope to see you soon.",

This is an outstanding restaurant and must be really special for dinner. From the valet parking to the great waitress we had along with phenomenal food it was definitely something special. We spent $300+ but it was well worth it. Georgia does need to get its act together no alcohol before 11 am on Sunday really??\nEven in South Carolina we can have mimosa and Bloody Mary.\nOur server was great very attentive and explained all item on the menu.\nFive stars all around. \nWe will be back next visit to Atlanta.",

The food came out again and the sausages were cold, the steak was still lukewarm and the potatoes had extra salt on them (sounds like someone tried to be malicious).  The manager came to our table (Valerie-very nice and personable) and asked us if things were ok.  I explained what happened and she had my food remade but the eggs weren't cooked to my liking the so I didn't both eating them.  The grits were very clumpy (it looked as if they weren't completely cooked) so we just sent them back and told them we didn't want them at all.  I highly doubt if I ever return here, this was not a good experience at all.",

Our waiter was the best part of the night. His character and charm he could sell the whole menu. I decided to have the egress, it's a light drink extremely refreshing definitely a summer/spring but honestly as tasty as it is I take it whenever. I was going to try another drink but I had 2 more egress. We also shared a Tiramisu and I HATE tiramisu but it was surprisingly good! Its not a huge dessert so in the event its something you enjoy make sure you get your own.\n\nThe interior is beautiful. The ceiling is covered in writing turned art. There is art working lining the walls. The place is something to look at for sure. The chairs were comfy and the place is on the smaller side but they utilized the space they had perfectly. The vibe of the place speak for itself, laid back but just enough to get the night started. The music is soft yet upbeat. \n\nThis location is perfect for brunch, date nights or just a day out with some friends. hey don't have any private dining rooms, so maybe try another location (there is another location in Midtown) if you want a more privacy. But you can rent the entire the place out for 5K, you wouldn't to decorate and I think open bar is included. **My friend asked for relying the information. **\n\nParking is made simple here. Just pull in and valet will take care of the rest. Valet is free, just make sure you tip the attendant",

I heard that each 5Church location was a little different aesthetically.\n\nThe ambiance and atmosphere are sophisticated and clean. As someone who has been to quite a few fine dining/upscale/New American restaurants, I thought this would be pretty similar. However, I was disappointed because the food was not great. The salad was just \"ok\" and my main dish was a bit heavy. I did not give this place 2 stars because the espresso martini and service redeemed the food. Also the prices are so high for the quality....",
