        "text": "My sorority sisters and I had a meeting gathering here and the experience was pretty good. I appreciated the fact that Agave didn't make us wait for our entire party to arrive before seating, a practice many Atlanta restaurants use and can be annoying sometimes. Even though they are located in a cut, they have free valet in their own private lot, which is great, considering space is at a premium in Atlanta nowadays. \n\nThe staff kept our chips and salsa full during our visit. The food came out quickly and did not disappoint. I enjoyed their guacamole and the chile and lime fish tacos. The peachtree margarita was great after a long day of work.\n\nI will return.",

But I can tell you one thing - I'm sure the margaritas are STRONG. These bartenders know exactly what to do.\n\nThe dinner is always changing and seasonal, so it's not typical menu items but I know these chefs also know their stuff. Agave is dressed up Mexican, not casual greasy junk.\n\nCome ready to be wowed! And if you are looking for a fun date idea, I recommend the seasonal Tequila dinner experience. It's a little pricy, but definitely worth it. You will leave full and drunk lol",

We waited 20 minutes for a table and finally got a terrible table(with a reservation) asked to move tables and got moved to a table in the hallway getting bumped into by servers. Returned 3 horrible margaritas made with what tasted like Mountain Dew before I finally just walked out with my girlfriend. Shortly after we were chased by the manager accused of stealing because we waited long enough to complain before nobody showed up to complain to. Would never recommend this dump of a restaurant to anybody. My dog can make better margaritas. If you want a good margarita come to my house.",

Let me start by saying I got a \"LocalFlavor\" aka Groupon equivalent for $15 for $30 worth of food. \n\nThe service: Our server was really cool and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. Always was swinging by to top off our water, but not an annoying amount. \n\nThe food: Me and my girlfriend agreed that the complimentary chips and salsa was the best we have ever had at any Mexican place and that is saying a ton! I ordered both the Veal Meatballs and the Chicken Quesadilla and my girlfriend got the Verde Pork Enchiladas.\n\nVeal Meatballs- Very tasty meatballs that you could tell weren't just frozen and made real quick, the cheese on top and the salsa/sauce it was in was amazing!\n\nChicken Quesadilla- This came out hot and delicious and came with plenty of guacamole and sour cream. It was filled to the brim with chicken and cheese, just the way a quesadilla should be.\n\nVerde Pork Enchiladas- A smaller order of enchiladas than most places, but the quality of the pork and cheese it came with was worth the price! \n\nOverall a great experience with quality food!",

The waiter said that he'd replace the glass, but never did. Aside from that, it was a great experience.\n\nI ordered the Southwestern Shrimp & Poblano Spring Rolls as a starter, the Veal Chorizo & Hatch Green Chile Meatloaf for the entree, a chocolate martini, and I ended it with a Pumpkin Praline Cheesecake for dessert.

I chose covered patio dining for my evening dinner reservation.  \n\nThe restaurant feels, and looks like an adobe inside, and it's kept nice, and cool as well. This made for an enjoyable dining experience. My server was Bri, and she was so awesome in rendering great hospitality, had a fun personality, and she made me feel like I was family.\n\nI had a strawberry margarita, and chips, and salsa for starters. The main entree was the fresh chile, and herb rubbed grilled lamb rack. It was served over a New Mexico Guahillo red chile puree atop of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, and I had a side of seared garlic spinach. The lamb was delicious, and the sides were simply perfect down to the last bite. Need I say more? You must check out Agave for your next dinner reservation.\n\nThank you for reading, and sharing this blog Dining Today!  For your next dining out experience I hope it's amazing, and make sure you are wearing fantastic accessories from  Diary Talk And More.",

        "text": "DATE NIGHT \n\nLiked - Liked - Liked - Liked - Liked - Liked - Liked - Liked - Liked \n\nMade a reservation on Open Table. (Very easy, hosts were expecting us, we were seated fast.) \n\nService was great, our waiter was attentive, friendly, helpful and visible. \n\nSalmon Tostadas -  I liked the dust of spice over top. Tostada strips were light but held up to the tostadas. \n\nRack of Lamb - The lamb was perfect, flavorful and very well cooked. The red chile puree didn't really stand out to me or have a lot of flavors but it did not take away from the dish. We got grilled veggies instead of asparagus. \n\nChipotle Mashed Sweet Potato - It was very savory, spicy, and lightly sweet. I didn't expect so much spice, but it was true to its name. \n\nGarlic Spinach - Delicious \n\nSpicy Peanut Butter Pie - Very Yummy, I could have enjoyed a little more spice but it was still good. \n\nGreat Tequilla Menu- I was able to get an Anejo I liked. \n\n\nDisliked - Disliked - Disliked - Disliked - Disliked - Disliked - Disliked \n\nI wasn't a fan of the Creme Fraiche on the salmon tostada. Personal preference but I was glad there wasn't much on each piece. \n\nIn my Patron Anejo Old Fashion, I wished they'd used an orange. They used lemon and cherry. The drink was still good but it didn't smooth out as I'd hoped. Again, it still was a good mix and I was very excited to see they even had so much tequila to choose from.",

        "text": "So incredibly disappointing. Ordered pickup on a Friday night around 8 PM, so busy but probably not the absolute peak. I called the restaurant when I was outside as parking can be tricky and they advertise curbside, but I was told that I had to come in. I understand that it's hard to have curbside when the restaurant is so busy, but it shouldn't be advertised if it's not offered.\n\nWhen I did come in, my food was not ready--I was actually advised that they never sent the order to the kitchen. Finally, 20 minutes after standing outside, I got my order. No offer to take anything off the bill or a gift card for next time.\n\nUnfortunately, things got worse from there. The street corn was simply burnt--tasted like nothing but burnt corn. No cheese taste, no spices, nothing. The ahi tuna was tough and also burnt--again, no flavor but burnt tuna. The only redeeming part of the meal was the guac--good flavor and the chips are homemade.\n\nI'm sure this is not the norm for Agave, but this has been one of my more disappointing meals in recent memory.",

The veggies were Mmm good!! The Margarita A1  dessert DELICIOUS and I don't usually do dessert. Guacamole was great as well. \n\nThe waitress was great, knowledgeable about the menu and specials.

My friends and I sat in their \"outdoor\" area but it was basically enclosed which we were grateful for since it was v cold outside. Our server was so attentive and educated on the menu, and that's important!! \n\nThe food was absolutely delicious with large sized portions. But one thing to point out - their grits. Listen, not everyone can do grits right, but these people CAN! \n\nThe parking lot is complimentary valet - but to be honest it so isn't needed. The parking lot is not that big nor is it that far from the restaurant. I definitely don't think they needed that but alas, prepare yourself for that.",

It's a southwestern themed restaurant that's intimate and has the most amazing tequila selection.\n\nMy favorite items are the crawfish pasta, peachtree margarita, spring rolls , calamari and the NY strip. Their homemade salsa is also one of the best I've ever had. I order the crawfish pasta 90% of the time because it's AMAZING. The cream sauce in the pasta is so delicious and they don't skimp on the crawfish. I like to bring people here because of the variety of items on the menu. There's literally something for everyone. They also have a vegetarian menu.\n\nThey offer specials throughout out the week including $12 entrees from 5-6 M-F, 2 for 1 apps at the bar during the same time and 10% off of your bill on the weekends (with email). It's seriously a great establishment with awesome food, delicious drinks and great staff.",

We had a table of 12 and some of my dining companions are not the easiest people to go out to eat with. Keith never missed a beat. Always there when we needed him. I think there was a mixup of items on the checks at the end and one margarita that was forgotten, but really when we ordered over 30 dishes and over 30 drinks all at random times and with people shouting over the table at him their order and everything made it, I think he did amazing. \n\nThe food itself was outstanding. The meatloaf and meatballs were the best meatloaf and meatballs I had ever had. I tried other appetizers as well and thought everything was very good. Two things I thought were just ok was the free salsa they gave us and the pasta someone ordered. However, everyone else at the table raved at the pasta so maybe it just wasn't my preference. \n\nThe restaurant space is not big but is very well decorated and comfortable. I really liked the open kitchen. I love watching professionals cook. Our table didn't have the best view of it. I would love to come back and sit at the bar or upstairs and watch them more. \n\nOverall it was a very good experience and would definitely love to come back and try even more next time.",

I discovered that at Agave. I pass this place when I take the back roads from downtown. It looks sketchy from the outside, but it's always packed. \nI finally went in, and it's fine on the inside. \nI really enjoyed their take on chips and salsa and I really liked the ceviche. However, I did not like the key lime pie. It tastes like the ones from the grocery store.",

A cozy little spot that is filled with the smells of fresh southwestern spices. I glance over the menu and decide on the Stuffed Mountain Trout. Fresh Georgia mountain trout stuffed with crawfish, mushrooms, onions, & basil over Spanish rice with a roasted tomatillo sauce & freshly cut cilantro. With every bite I enjoy the freshly caught seafood dressed in tomatillo and freshly picked cilantro. I have to meet the genius of this mouth watering creation. My server is nice enough to bring the chef over to receive compliments from the patron who has devoured this amazing dish. O reccomend Agave twice over......",

We happened to be in the neighborhood on a Sunday around 5pm so it was a no-brainer. \n\nParking was easy; they have a lot with a complimentary valet. \nWe got there around 5:45pm and without reservations, were seated immediately. As soon as we were seated Numb by Zhu started playing and I knew it was going to be a good time. Their playlist rivals some DJs. \n\nOur server was prompt with impeccable timing. The kitchen was quick and precise. My brother's steak was cooked to a perfect medium while I had a veal and chorizo meatloaf with collards and mac 'n cheese that was stupid good. \n\nI think labeling this as a Tex-Mex place is a disservice to the culinary prowess of the chefs. Mexican Fusion is more accurate. They took a boring, southern classic and turned it into something altogether unique. \n\nThe range of flavors in the meatloaf, and the texture. My God, the texture! Like a hot knife through butter. The collards were slightly sweet, a welcome surprise, not better or worse than the traditional way of cooking them - just different. And the mac 'n cheese...DISCLAIMER: I'm super bougie when it comes to mac 'n cheese (if that wasn't already apparent by my abbreviating \"and\" with 'n) so I was thinking, \"Tex Mex mac 'n cheese, this is going to be terrible\".  Never have I been so wrong! Well, maybe thinking the Falcons would win the SuperBowl but that wound is still too fresh...I digress...\n\nIn summation; Agave is awesome! Go there and put food in your mouth hole. \n\nOh, but avoid the flan - the flan is horrible.",

        "text": "TLDR: Hatch green chiles. Get them here.\n\nAgave is a Southwestern/New Mexican restaurant. Yelp currently lists it as 'Tex-Mex', but that is incorrect (change submitted but I'm not hopeful - ETA: my change was rejected).\n\nIt's also one of the many places I've been to in Atlanta going on many years but have failed to review. The Atlanta Cuisine food forum crowd (RIP) used to come here a lot back in the day, sipping margaritas at the small bar, and Tom Maicon (the force behind Atlanta Cuisine) has touted the restaurant since its inception.\n\nRightfully so, I think. Agave's kitchen creates a fairly wide menu of southwestern dishes, many using the Hatch chile, the best of its kind in the world. You won't find screaming hot food here, although New Mexico is known for that. Instead, the flavors are more balanced and subtle.\n\n- Margaritas: one the main draws here.The margaritas are top notch and if you don't see one that exactly fits your mood, they'll make one that will. My wife asked for something 'not sweet' and was promptly served up a margarita that was heavy on the tequila and lime and light on the sugary liqueur. I prefer the Herradura Top Shelf, with salt of course.\n\n- Chips n salsa: complimentary and good\n\n- Guacamole: very good, although the 'full' order could be fuller.\n\n- Chile relleno: unlike any other I've had, Agave's version is a steak relleno light on the cheese. Excellent. Fairly large, too.\n\n- Rolled fish tacos: unusual in that they're rolled, they also are not the big, stuffed puppies you get elsewhere (such as down the road a piece at Six Feet Under). Tasty.\n\n- Cayenne Fried Chicken: I'm stretching my memory for this one but I recall being happy with it. I'll have to try it again soon.\n\nThe bar is not large but it's the place to be if there's only two of you, or you're by yourself. Starters are two for one between 5 - 7 and you'll want to arrive early to get a seat.\n\nBartenders are great.\n\nRounding up on this one from 4.5 to 5 stars. I like Agave.",

That was no problem & we were immediately seated upon arrival. Our waiter, Malcolm was nice, but did not check on our table as frequently as I would have liked. We ordered drinks & my friends liked theirs but mine ( Peach Margarita) was a bit watery for me. I asked Malcolm for a Hennessy Margarita instead, like my friend got. It took about 20 mins to get the new drink but it was good when I finally received it. I got the spring rolls for an appetizer & the porkchop dinner. The spring rolls came with 2 nice dipping sauces which really added a nice flavor. The meal itself was nice, although nothing spectacular. The porkchop tasted good & the collard greens & mashed potatoes were satisfying. Again, not spectacular. Overall, we enjoyed our meal, but it was mostly due to the company I was with rather than the food & service. The restaurant was not crowded at all & I ultimately thought Malcolm could have done better with actually remembering to bring back the items we requested in a more timely fashion. I would probably not return, but you should check it out & see for yourself!",

They either lost my reservation or I didn't do something right, but they were able to seat us upstairs fairly quickly even though it was a busy Thursday night. It was like we had a cool VIP view of the restaurant! \n\nThe service, however, was EXTREMELY slow. It felt like we were being ignored. It took almost a half an hour for our drink orders to even be taken. We had to keep trying to flag our server down, which was hard because we were separate from the rest of the restaurant. \n\nThe food was good, but I think they should pay more attention to having quality ingredients cooked well than creativity and having a huge menu (which is definitely on point). The veal/chorizo meatballs are amaze-balls (har har). I would come back just for those. My huge barbacoa and chorizo taco was good, but I could have done with more sauce, it was a bit dry on top. My feeling is that if you can't pick up the taco, it should be covered in sauce. \n\nLoving all the hatch green chile appearances. \n\nHating their lack of spicy sauces and things that claim to be spicy, but are just not (spicy jalapeño margarita, spicy chicken, smoking hot margarita). They did give me some fresh Serranos, which helped some. \n\nI appreciate all the specials they have. Groupon, Seated, etc.",

Drinks were really good including the wine which was a surprise at a tequila bar.\n\nFood was pretty good. We ordered the ceviche which missed the mark. Shrimp were hard and rubbery. But the meatballs were wonderful and the short ribs really good too. \n\nThe one thing that offended me was the tip suggestions on our pay stubs. The low percent was twenty and high end was 30. 30%! I routinely tip anywhere from 20 to 25% for good service sometimes higher if it's outstanding. But Ive NEVER had a restaurant suggest 30% is within the realm of normal. What that tells me is as a restaurant you are shouldering the burden of inflation on your patron instead of paying your employees correctly. This infuriates me. Pay you're employees! My tip should never be factored in as 30% of your employees pay. The end",

As far as parking it is all free valet (free obviously with a tip , poor guys were running their butts off in the rain last time we went, so bring a little cash!)\n\nI usually get the scallops which melt in your mouth like butter and they are served with grits and collard greens. The last time I felt like splurging so I ordered the NY Strip with mashed potatoes. The NY Strip was so TENDER. I ate the whole thing. I NEVER eat that much food. As you can see from the picture this was a pretty big steak\n\nOther recommendations get the guacamole!!! And a margarita. And don't forget about dessert, I always get a chocolate dessert (last time was the chocolate mousse, the whipped cream had cinnamon in it!) with a nice, cream sherry. Yum!",

        "text": "eat spot a little off the beaten path in Atlanta. Perfect for visitors or locals looking for a great new spot for Mexican/Southwestern cuisine. This is a restaurant best suited to adults, in my opinion, although we did see kids there. \n\nThe menu is packed with more dishes than you can imagine, making this a much more enjoyable dinner than the traditional Tex-Mex located in your nearby shopping mall. Our group sampled everything from Tacos, to steak, and even wings (for the diner who doesn't enjoy Mexican food). The great news is that there is something for everyone, including dishes you may have never tried before.\nWe will definitely dine here again, looking for a five-star experience. If you want Mexican, I would give Agave a try",
