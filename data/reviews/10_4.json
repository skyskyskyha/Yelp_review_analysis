        "text": "Overall experience was \"ehh\". Kind of long post, FYI.\n\nHad a reservation at 8, showed up at 8:05, but weren't sat until around 8:15... not a big deal.\n\nWeren't greeted immediately bc my boyfriend & I had enough time to look over the menu & decide on everything we wanted before the server even came to greet us. \n\nOnce the server arrived, we ordered everything at once (crab cakes, Caesar salad, chicken, steak, mashed potatoes & lobster Mac), then the server proceeded to say it was a good idea to order everything because they \"cook everything homemade & the kitchen is also backed up\"..... uhhhh ok? \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a glass of wine as well, but he didn't get that until after our appetizers... around 9- mind you, we sat down at 815. Apps took about 35ish minutes to come out. Caesar salad & crab cakes were good & I was happy to see that the crab cakes were steaming hot so at least I know they weren't just sitting back there since it took a while for those to come out.\n\nDinner on the other hand didn't come out until around 935... again, we sat down at our table at 815. At this point, we were just laughing bc we saw another couple sit down & leave before they were even greeted by their server... that's how long service was taking. I asked my server what was the reason behind the extreme wait time & he went into this weird explanation that there was only one person per station, but anyone that's worked in a kitchen knows that that is pretty standard... they seemed short staffed all around. \n\nI did see Chef G Garvin walking around a little, but he wasn't greeting patrons tables as some have left reviews saying. I feel like he wasn't doing this because he knew that people were waiting extremely long.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe if i was in the area & only immediately at opening time bc waiting over an hour for entrees is unacceptable anywhere you go. I was told this restaurant had only been open for 2 months so I hope they get the kitchen staff together or else... they're not going to last. Food was decent, but I wouldn't tell any family/friends to go bc of that atrocious wait time.",

        "text": "My husband made reservations here for my birthday. I was excited to experience the cuisine of Chef G. Garvin.\nAlthough we ABHOR going to Atl for anything, I gave in becuz  it's him.\nWe arrive, and you have to park in a deck and text a word to a code to pay for parking. So many dern steps..but, I didn't think anything of it cuz it's atl...\nWe arrive in the restaurant and the hostess doesn't say hi or anything. She yells \"SHAWN!\" I say, no, but how are u? Lol \nI tell her the name and they seat us immediately. \nA friend had previously been and told us a few things to try. \n\nSo we're viewing the menu and know we want to start with lobster bisque, crab cakes and deviled eggs. Well, they were out of the bisque. I'm a bit confused, cuz our reservation was at 6 and they opened at 5 \nHell, idk how restaurants do in that regard, so, I was like ok whatever... \nI ordered the 12oz filet mignon, hubby got the 14oz bone in ribeye. Sides were whipped mash, green beans, and Mac n cheese. All seasoned VERY VERY WELL! We did order some creamed corn, which we heard was amazing. Waiter came back and said they were out \nOk.......\nFor dessert, we ordered the doughnut bread pudding! So delish! I also had a bday cake that they charged $10 to cut 2 slices......... I know I know, I get there's a cutting fee......\n\nI was a little disappointed that Chef Garvin didn't come speak. He walked around showing his face the entire time, but never spoke. ( we were 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant)... but I get it, gotta look important on a MONDAY! \n\n\nThe food was top notch! WE WILL DEF BE BACK!",

She said well I don't prefer that course of action, as if she was actually going to call the cops.I told her I've had a many steaks, even at this restaurant and to please go get a second opinion.

The parking is around the corner in a parking building where you have to pay by a parking app. However, the restaurant will validate for 2 hours which was a pleasant surprise. Great menu with a number of dishes to choose from.  The crab cake appetizer is a must.   The drinks were all really good, a little pricey but not much over your normal steak house price.  The sea bass was a hit at the table.  They made a vegan version for someone in my party with tofu and she loved it.  I got the surf and turf.  It was very tasty, might have been a little overpriced but for a special occasion it happens sometimes.   Loved the spot and will be back for special occasions.",

        "text": "This is a great new spot right in the heart of midtown. Service was great from the moment you walk in. We had a pretty large group but with our reservation we were seated right away. I don't eat red meat but my husband does but we felt there was a great amount of variety for both of us. We started with the tuna tartar, deviled eggs (I was able to remove the bacon), and the crab cakes. The tuna was great and fresh. I do with it was served with a version of a chip rather than bread but still great. The devil eggs were fantastic. I even loved the crab cakes and I typically hate crab of all kinds. But I was fresh and light so that made a difference. The chicken dish is EVERYTHING! It's served in a creamy sauce over mashed potatoes and it's is done perfectly. Like a flavor party in your mouth. My husbands steak was HUGE. He said it was great and even better the next day when he ate the leftovers. I finished with a peach cobbler. Not your typical peach cobbler because the crust Ken done with a puff pastry as the crust. Just the right amount of sweet. It was all so good, I went back again with a friend of mine and it was all great again. I didn't try anything different because I was craving what I had before but there are some items I'm definitely going back to try like the shrimp and grits. \nGreat atmosphere, great service. Just go.",

But the restaurant had a few goofy things going on that management should not allow.  Easy stuff to fix.  Example.... I ordered a chopped Caesar which was served straight out of the cooler in the same bowl.  No joke... the bowl practically had ice crystals on it.  So cold that had to order a hot tea to get myself back to room temp.  The tea comes out and the water is served in a large cream pourer (not sure what you call it).  Just odd. No pot?  My 12oz filet seemed a little soft when it came out but I'll tell you... they actually nailed it.  Right at the Medium Rare + that I asked for.  Really good job in the kitchen.  Broccoli was well cooked also. Thank you! Nothing worse than overcooked broccoli.   I admit I was craving a cheesecake and maybe it's a regional thing, but nada here.  All in all, I'd come again, but I'd skip the Caesar unfortunately.  It should be double the size and in room temp bowl.  Shout out to Donovan who took care of me at the bar.  The people working here are quality.   Just fix the operational pieces and you're a 5 star.   Thank you...",

I mean, chef's kiss! I went with a group and we ordered a host of sides. Brussel sprouts, creamed corn, Parmesan fries, and mashed potatoes. I got a spoon (or two) of each and enjoyed every bite. I'd definitely recommend for a business dinner or date night. Plus, they validate parking (I think for 2hrs).",

Steak was not well seasoned at all. The only flavor was the butter on top. Service was good, but our waitress hustled us out of $12 for water. I'll take the L on that for not being very specific about wanting tap water. I ordered a bottle of wine and got a different brand than what was on the menu. All said and done with 20% tip, the bill was $275. Definitely not worth it.",

        "text": "First let me say that we watch G Garvins Cooking show on a regular basis, so for my upcoming birthday (which is today) we decided to go to Low Country Steak.  We reserved my table on Opendoor and advised that the special occasion was my birthday.   When we arrived we were welcomed with a warm greeting from the door to our table.  To start the server let us know she was going to be serving us but it would be a group effort, as she was in her last day of training. Ok, I was open to that, I wanted to make her feel comfortable, everyone has to start somewhere.  But soon after the greeting and giving us a few minutes to look over the menu, letting us know what the specials were...  service went down from there.  We ordered once we asked about a couple of things on the menu.  We are sitting there and hear the very personable server (Joshua) attending the table next to us thoroughly go over the specials and explain the dishes with such enthusiasm we heard a couple of other items we had no idea about. So I overheard his name and called him before he walked away and inquired about the seafood pasta and the calamari that wasn't offered to us.  My companion also overheard him explaining the steak selection to the table next to us which made him realize the ribeye we ordered may not have the bone which we prefer so he explained it and then proceeded to let us know that the restaurant was out of them. He was polite enough to ask if we wanted to change the order but assured us the boneless was just as flavorful so we kept it. Well when our server came back I mentioned that hey you didn't let us know about the seafood pasta or the calamari and she  was like oh sorry yes we have that. Ok. Then she took our wine glasses. Once again I heard Joshua explaining the wine and she said oh you didn't get a drink menu and we told her no, she brought one over  Besides that and bringing our water that was the last time she came back around. We saw the trainer a couple of times when she came back to see if we were satisfied with the temperature of the steaks  and everything but not much more. She seemed rush as she had a big party and a couple of other tables.  The last time I saw the training server she was bringing the check , which we hadn't asked for ,when I had to stop her and say hey do you have any desserts? It's my birthday, what do you have.  She simply said oh happy birthday, brought a menu, stated that all they do is put a candle on it and what would you like to order. Now I also explained this was our first time here and we hadn't been given a full run or details about the food and /or recommendations , if we wanted or needed anything else and wasn't really getting a full experience. She smiled and apologized that it was part her fault because the other young lady was training and she should have helped a little more. So my companion was talking to her about an item on the menu and trying to compare it to something and either she didn't realize he was still talking to her or didn't care and walked off!  Joshua came back over and we talked and we asked when he worked if we ever decided to come back.We learned more about the food and the menu from listening to him serve the people around us.  It speaks volumes that I remember Joshua who wasn't even our server and I can't tell you the names of the two ladies who were assigned to our table.  The food was good but the service was subpar.  When you go to a supposedly 5 star restaurant and pay those prices you should have a 5 star experience and customer service. That's why we choose these types of restaurants for a higher end experience. Food and Service.  I regret spending my birthday here.  Having good food alone won't keep customers coming back but a combination of good food and exceptional service will.  Please find more servers like Joshua. He was the only one who thanked us for coming and hoped we'd come back, ask for him and he would take care of us. If we ever decide to come back he would be the reason why. Disappointed at best.",

Came to the establishment based on the menu online.  Arrived at the restaurant and the menu was not the same.  Totally get menu changes but it also takes a few minutes to update your online menu.  chef G you have to do better.  Your celebrity will only get you so far.  Pay attention to the details if you are trying to do this for real.  Don't rely on your black card for a pass for sub-par food.  Wishing you all the best",

        "text": "For those with ADD, let me simply state that this is not a steakhouse. No way, no how!  If you want a great steakhouse experience intown, try Marcel or Kevin Rathbun Steak, where we typically go for great meat and the service you expect at a top notch steakhouse .  \n\nFirst, the ambiance at Low Country feels like an upscale cafeteria, with very few booths and a lot of tables that feel like they were rented and arranged by an event company.  The space is generic, cavernous and simply doesn't have the scale, aesthetic and intimacy you expect when dropping $300.00 on a dinner. \n\nNow, on to the steak.  I ordered the aged Kansas City Strip and requested the temperature to be blue.  My daughter ordered the filet prepared rare.  Hers arrived medium and mine barely rare.  The quality of the meat was about what we get in the case at our local Kroger.  The Bearnaise and Hollandaise sauces were broken and roughly the consistency of egg drop soup.  To reiterate, this is not a steakhouse!\n\nThat said, the mussels app, salad, fried chicken and macaroni and cheese were good.  I think the Low Country needs to adjust the quality of food and experience to meet the hype and prices, or realistically value what they are offering if they expect to survive in a market with vastly superior options.",

The parking garage adjacent to the building made things easy with transitioning back and forth to our car. I did think the food was pretty good. I found the outer crust to my steak to be a little charred though. I ordered it medium & I thought the lobster Mac and cheese was missing something. The highlight to me were the crab cakes and the calamari. If I were to go back, I'd probably just order drinks and appetizers. We spent over 300 and they really didn't do anything to celebrate birthdays. I was expecting a complementary birthday dessert and that was not offered. Overall good experience though.",

Nonetheless she was absolutely incredible.The restaurant was very beautiful had a upscale vibe but also gave a little let your hair down after work. The deviled eggs did not disappoint and you could taste every pepper on that bacon. But who steals the show?? The CRAB CLAWS!!!! Omg! The blends of seasonings and herbs had me dancing at the table. Now for the entrees... can we say BOMB.com??? I got the blackened Ribeye with lump crab meat and my husband got the Ribeye that had a chimichurri spread over it. The steaks literally melt in your mouth. If you want to add sides I suggest the loaded potatoes and green beans just add a dabble of salt if you like a little extra kick to your veggies or if you don't have high blood pressure!",

The parking is tricky, park in the adjacent garage and the restaurant will validate up to 2 hours of your parking charges.

The food wasn't bad but also not memorable. There was nothing about the experience that would make me recommend or return. Again not horrible but there was no wow factor, no memorable dish, experience, etc. We spent about $280 including a tip for the 4 of us.",

        "text": "Outstanding!  My husband got his Covid beard shaved off across the street, so we wandered into Low Country Steak for dinner. We were greeted by a very professional host staff who seated us immediately. Our server (shout out to Julia) was so kind, patient, and helpful. She was a big reason we enjoyed our evening so much. We ordered the deviled eggs and calamari for apps-both delicious. And for dinner I got the pasta/steak special and my husband ordered the shrimp and grits. Our main topic of conversation during dinner was how good our dinner was. Well done!  We-will-be-back!",

The music playing in the dinning room was not boring but relevant without been noisy and bothersome.  The food came out in a great amount of time. The crab cakes were ALL quality crab, the ribeye aged bone in  was everything the served said it would be and so much more, the Mac n cheese was the perfect creamy, the green beans has the perfect amount of seasoning with pieces of garlic garnished on top, and the truffle fries with house made ketchup did not disappoint. G Garvin walked the dinning  room greeting guests asking if their meals were made to their liking. He spoke with my table and friends for about 15 to 20 mins to welcome us and check on us. He was so friendly and welcoming. One of the steaks was not prepared medium as we requested but we did not complain but he noticed right away and took it off the bill as the kitchen was already closed so he could not have the prepare it again.  We will return to this axing restaurant. Everything was delicious!",

Enjoyed the atmosphere from the quickness of staff turning over tables to fresh white table linen. To providing drink in a moment. Seating was nicely spaced to adhere to Covid protocols.  Now the food was exceptional.  Thoroughly enjoyed our entire meal. From appetizer to main course. The presentation was on point. If In Atlanta,  please support this business.",

The restaurant is extremely well managed, the staff are very attentive and they all pitch in to help each other meet your every whim. But the food is the highlight of this place. Everything is seasoned perfectly and cooked exactly to order which can be challenging with steak. The snow crab claws, lump crab cocktail, filet and bone in rib eye were some of our favorites. The cocktails were perfectly crafted! And don't forget to leave room for the donut bread pudding!",

They just sat me at a table and continued to talk to each other. The bartender ended up telling me and by that time it was too late. I had $60 meal for one and ended paying for the parking although it should've been validated. I also called a couple of weeks ago and asked the GM if I could pay in advance to have two cookbooks signed for friends. He took the information, but I have yet to hear from him.

        "text": "Sooooooooo. In town for the DST convention.  It has been hella hard to find somewhere to eat and for my Voting/Alternate delegates, the struggle is real.  So I open up my Facebook and see my Soror raving about this place and how G Garvin kept it open for the Deltas. Wow that's where I'm going to go and immediately tried to make a reservation for my chapter, around 20 people.  Imagine my distress when I try to use Open Table (the restaurant's suggestion) and can only reserve for 6. I had to use another profile to reserve for another 6.  12 seats still short of my 20 but with attrition and soirée we could make it work.  I tried to call the restaurant to confirm and explain but no one answered.  I went about my day doing the work of Delta, fully intending to show up at 8:30.  Unfortunately DST has other plans and our last session will convene at 7:30 ( thus was established at around 6:00/6:15). Ok. No problem.  I have other Sorors who can keep the date and I came come later. Then I get a call at 7 from the restaurant asking me if I knew I had 2 reservations or was it a mistake.  I told Karen that I had indeed made 2 res for 6. She replied with I should have called for a large party. I told her I did but got no answer.  She countered with we called you twice.  I lobbed with I was in session and could not answer the phone but I still intended to use the space but if I found I wouldn't need them I would call back at 7:30 (an hour before).  Lo and behold before 15 min was out Ranchhouse Becky had canceled my reservations. Pretty sure business tonight is going to be on the slow side because a lot of people have left ATL and the others are at the soirée. Not sure I want to patronize this business here nor his restaurant in LA. Thanks for narrowing an already slim selection.",
