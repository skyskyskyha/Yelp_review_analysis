        "text": "I simply cannot recommend this place. \n\nFirst, let me say the service was very kind and attentive. No complaints on service. \n\nDRINKS\nThe cocktails were average. I had the Jack Rose. Husband had a Mint Julep. Neither were terrible. Neither were very good. We switched to wine which was fine. \n\nFOOD\nThe bread service was amazing. My olives were not pitted which seems so lazy for such a pricey meal. But the bread was superb. \n\nThe Marcel salad was phenomenal. This is the best thing we ate all night, and I'd love to have it again. If I came back, I'd just get the salad and maybe dessert. \n\nFor dinner we had the beef Wellington, mushrooms and scalloped potatoes. The Wellington was fine. It seemed exorbitantly expensive but ok. I'm not a meat price expert. It was far too salty. It was edible, but it was a salt factory. \n\nThe saltiness only got worse. The mushrooms were inedibly salty. We had to send them back. They literally burned my mouth with salt. \n\nThe scalloped potatoes were pretty good, but they were charred on top. I don't mean browned or a little burnt, I mean charred. We had to pick off the charred part because it was inedible and added a burnt flavor to the dish. \n\nThese seem like small quibbles, and I'm almost embarrassed to write about them. But for a $400 meal, these types of mistakes are not acceptable. \n\nDesserts were good. The baked Alaska was great and the bananas fosters was a nice touch. \n\nI'd give Marcel 3 stars if the price had been lower. But for fine dining prices, we did not get a fine dining meal. \n\nMaybe we came on a down night. But it was simply not worth the price.",

        "text": "We've heard about the beef wellington at Marcel from quite a few people and finally had a chance to try it out! Reservations were easy using Open Table, definitely recommend making one. They have free parking (validated for up to 3 hrs) at the parking deck next to it (the one near Flower Child and Lulu Lemon) - just don't forget to ask the hostess/host for one on the way out.\n \nThe restaurant is pretty dimly lit and a bit chilly (I get cold easily), so bring a jacket if you're like me. We were seated in an intimate U shaped booth and had amazing service. Water was filled constantly, they explained the menu, and made us feel so welcome (thank you!).\n \nFood/price: we were greeted with complimentary bread, slices of prosciutto, whipped ricotta, and olives. The bread was buttery and so good. Between 3 people, we shared:\n \n- Cote de Bouef ($116.95): 22 oz dry aged ribeye. Wasn't salted I think so we asked for salt to season as we needed. It was cooked beautifully to medium rare.\n \n- Veal Parmesan ($49.95): with san Marzano tomatoes, fior de latte. They were nice enough to slice the veal for us already so it was easier to eat. I personally love parmesan dishes like eggplant and chicken so this was one of my favorites lol.\n \n- Beef Wellington ($189.95): NOTE that it requires 24 hour notice! Chateaubriand, mushroom duxelles, prosciutto, puff pastry - they bake it to be ready along with your other dishes which I think is thoughtful. We asked for the beef to be medium well.\n \n- Pommes Aligot ($17.95): the best way I can describe this is cheesy mashed potatoes. When you see that cheese pull, wow - beautiful. Who doesn't like cheese and carbs?\n \nOverall, the experience was definitely nice. Be prepared to drop a pretty penny. Personally, I think that you could skip out on the steak options and share the other classic entrees or sides with a beef wellington since that's their highlight.",

This was my second time coming to Marcel, and the second time might have been even better than the first but the first time was just as great as the second time. \n\nThey accept reservations up until 15 minutes before they close. However, this will not affect your experience. Our server Kevin brought great energy, although we were one of his last tables of the night, and all the servers that assisted him had great energy as well.  \n\nI have yet to find a restaurant I like as much as Marcel, so if you (yelpers) know a place that is comparable, please reach out to me lol  thanks",

Every detail from the beautiful bar, the curtains, the amenities in the restrooms, to the magnifying glasses for the black and white photos on the walls. Stepping into this restaurant feels like you've entered a glamorous era. And I'm here for it! \n\nThe food was delicious. We started with the bone marrow - just do it, you'll thank me after. My husband and I split the ribeye and shared a couple sides. The servicing size is generous, especially for such a luxe meal. We had plenty of leftovers for the next day! \n\nLastly and certainly not least, the service was one of our top experiences since moving to Atlanta a year ago. Tucker is a wonderful server, he made such a great impression on us. He was incredibly detailed in his approach to introduce newcomers to the restaurant. We were instantly immersed into the experience because of him. \n\nWe'll be back & request to sit in Tuckers area.",

        "text": "Celebrated my bf's birthday here and had an amazing time! \n\nFOOD: \nBread service: The bread is almost identical to the texture of the Korean hotteok(a glutinous pancake). The ham was a bit too salty for me but I loved pairing it with the ricotta cheese. My bf was a big fan of the olives as well. \n\nSweet Shrimp Scampi ($24.95) - The sauce was to die for. I almost wanted to ask for a spoon to get more mouthfuls of it with the shrimp. I recommend adding only a little bit of lemon as the sauce itself is already delicious.\n\nPommes Dauphinoise ($18.95) - In non-fancy terms, this is basically scalloped potatoes. I mean potatoes + cheese and then broiling it? What more can you ask for? It was so rich and delicious, highly recommend! \n\nBone-in New York Strip ($85.95) - We had asked for the cook to be medium rare, but it definitely came out more on the rare side. It was fine since I'm not too picky with the cook as long as it's not well done, but not a good look if you are known for your steaks and can't get the cook right. However, I have no doubts that they would have fixed it for us if we had mentioned it to them. Otherwise, the steak was seasoned well and I loved that they gave us hot plates so the steak wouldn't get cold. \n\nBananas Foster Baked Alaska ($16.95) - An absolute must! The presentation alone is something I haven't seen in a lot of fine dining restaurants and the taste did not disappoint either. One thing to note is that the desserts are not complimentary even if you are coming in for a special occasion! \n\nSERVICE:\nBryce and Todd, and all the servers really, were phenomenal. I truly enjoyed their service and appreciated how special they made my bf feel for his birthday. Would highly recommend them! \n\nIf you parked in the parking deck, they also provide a parking validation card for 3 hours! \n\nOVERALL:\nWill definitely be back for another special occasion! Would love to try other items on the menu. Highly recommend making a reservation on OpenTable!",

We called ahead to ensure our tardiness would be acceptable with our reservation. The staff was understanding and accommodating.\nThe environment was dim lighting but not so low that we couldn't see one another or our meals. The wait staff was highly energetic, with a beautiful group of service providers who gave us an excellent experience.\nThe menu offers perfect portions so as not to feel stuffed but satisfied. We had the Marcel oysters, Marcel salad, and Porterhouse steak for two with cheesy potatoes. All of the food was magnificent, beautifully thought out flavor profiles. They also sent us home with a menu that said Happy Anniversary, with our wait staff's signatures wishing us well for our upcoming year. We will certainly be returning again.\nWe look forward to trying the Beef Wellington on our next visit.",

It shows.\n\nWhat we had:\n- focaccia/whipped ricotta/warm olives - it's the free starter and is incredible.  The bread is pan crisped\n- French onion soup - outstanding depth, great balance\n- escargot - flavor was WOW\n- oysters Marcel - delicious herbs and briny oysters \n- filet madame - exceptionally crusted and cooked to perfection \n- bone-in dry aged ribeye - excellent crust, cooked beautifully to medium rare\n- cacio e pepe - like an Italian restaurant recipe \n- asparagus - crisp and sautéed nicely \n- sticky toffee pudding - a Marcel-only dessert\n\nI would have LOVED to get the Wellington but it requires 24 hour advanced notice\n\nHad specialty cocktails and waiter recommended reds with the beef and all were nicely done.",

Marcel checks off every box when it comes to a fine dining experience: supreme service, beautiful ambiance, and excellent food!! \n\nReservations are highly recommended here. My friend and I came on a Sunday evening, which was still surprisingly very busy. After we were escorted to our table, we were immediately greeted by our main server. She introduced her entire team, which I thought was a lovely touch. One of the team members took our drink orders and brought out their infamous bread service. The bread was like a small focaccia brushed with herbed butter and served with a whipped cheese, olives and prosciutto. DELICIOUS! I wish I could have ordered three of those lol. \n\nOur main server promptly returned to explain the menu and her recommendations on how to order. We decided to share several items, including the escargot, tomahawk steak for two, pommes aligot (very creamy potatoes with mozzarella) and bananas foster for dessert. Jesus take the wheel!! That food was out of this world. The best steak I've eaten in Atlanta. I was so in awww of the entire experience that I neglected to take pictures of our main dishes. Now when we got to the bananas foster dessert, I had to take a video. Soooo cool. I honestly had the best time at Marcel and cannot wait to come here for date night with the hubs. 10/10!!!",

For an  appetizer, I ordered sweet shrimp scampi and my hubby got a Caesar salad. The shrimp were plump and cooked perfectly. For entrees, we both ordered bone in NY strips and shared fries, pommes aligot and creamed corn. Pommes aligot is basically the most buttery, cheesiest potatoes that you could ever dream of.

        "text": "IF YOU WANT OUTSTANDING SERVICE as well as DELICIOUS FOOD, come here in 2023. \n\nThe ambiance here is absolutely second to none. It's slightly darker, true to its French roots, and the setting is clearly detailed and thoughtful. This is an intimate, more dimly lit restaurant with a beautiful interior. \n\nHowever, can I just say. The service here is amazing. Not sure if I'm the only one who struggles to find good service in the present day anywhere I go, but the staff here is incredible. There are people constantly tending to the table, and not in an obnoxious way. My water was constantly filled, napkins replaced and folded, silverware switched out, our orders with a few substitutions perfectly crafted and not a thing left out. The staff is just amazing. I have gotten way more grateful for that type of service post COVID because I believe it is RARE. \n\nI realize I haven't even talked food yet, but this is my favorite restaurant in Atlanta. I have gone twice now and waited until after to leave this review to make sure I didn't have recency bias before. The chicken was amazing, the pasta was amazing, the dessert. The steak was perfectly cooked and juicy. \n\nI have not a single bad thing to say. I will come here for every special occasion for as long as I live here.",

I offered Apple Pay, my credit number so they can charge it manually or any other method since I didn't have my wallet. I'm sure it's happened to most people.\n\nThe assistant manager came at me aggressively and basically insinuated that I can't afford it because I'm a minority. Said I must provide cash or she hold something of mine until I paid. In 2024 and in years of eating in high end restaurant, I have never experienced this. It was so loud that other tables heard it and was asking me what the issue was. Embarrassing and I will never eat here. \n\nBeware",

We were seated quickly and two waiters served us. We started with bread service, which was excellent. Would have been nice to pit the olives. The oysters tasted very fresh. We had a dozen, 6 from the east coast and 6 from the west coast. Up next was bone marrow, which was very savory and went well on the bread. For the entree I had a 22 ounce bone in ribeye that was prime and dry aged. Wonderful and tender. I couldn't finish it. Also had sides of scalloped potatoes which were great, mushrooms and cacio and pepe. My spouse had veal Parmesan. Portion sizes were large. I tried two types of red wine: a Nebbiolo (good) and a Carignan blend (freaking fantastic!!!). For dessert, bananas foster. I left stuffed. Total bill for our table of four was around $560. I would totally come back.",

Nice jazz playing softly in the background, and it wasn't overbearing or anything. \n\nThe receptionist were welcoming and very personable. Our first server was off to a wonderful start, engaging us and explaining the restaurant protocols. However, we were sat next to a couple who'd ordered a lot of seafood. I, unfortunately, acquired a sever allergic reaction to seafood a few years ago, so we had to be moved. The staff beautifully and immediately accommodated my needs and assured me that my safety was their priority. This was HUGE to my Hubs & I! \n\nOn to the food, when I tell you, every single thing we tasted was perfectly prepared and was bursting with flavors! The portions were plentiful and definitely shareable. \n\nNo the service!!! If you're lucky enough, try to get sat in Jordan & Jheira's section! They are both absolutely amazing, complete professionals! They made my birthday  dinner extremely special! We will definitely be back!!!",

His name was Kevin and he was super knowledgeable about everything on the menu. I took all of his recommendations and I'm so glad that I did the salad that he recommended was spectacular. I believe it had 18 ingredients inside of it.\n\nI ordered the eggplant Parmesan, and it was cooked to perfection. The bread on the eggplant was crunchy and crisp. The marinara sauce that was freshly created was mouthwatering and the cheese the top. The eggplant Parm tasted like it was freshly made. \n\nI got a side of cheese mashed potatoes and I've never had mashed potatoes that cheesy but it was so good. The highlight and real surprise was the mushrooms.?OMG, I could've eaten those mushrooms all day. They were spectacular. I don't know what the chef put on those mushrooms, but they were so seasoned and cooked very well. \n\nUnfortunately, I did not get a chance to take any pictures but hopefully from my yelp review, you'll have time to go and try the food like I did.",

        "text": "This is one of those restaurants you MUST try if you live in the Atlanta area and need a good \"Special Occasion\" restaurant.  My husband and I came here last night to celebrate our anniversary.  We couldn't have been happier with the experience!\n\nThe first thing you should know is that the restaurant has valet parking but also validates parking in the Westside Provisions District parking deck (which is literally a 2 min walk to the restaurant).  Marcel isn't super easy to find so just know it's on the 2nd level right next to the Flowerchild restaurant.  Upon entering, I noticed that the restaurant is dimly lit, which makes for a perfect date night or romantic evening.  Also, you will hear traditional/classic jazz being played all evening, which I could definitely appreciate.  I requested a booth in my reservation and we were accommodated.  I also like the \"Happy Anniversary\" menus that we received upon being seated.  Very nice touch.\n\nOur waitress, Bonita, came over promptly and offered a menu \"tour\" which was very helpful.  We started with a hot seafood tower (which was easily customized for us since I'm allergic to oysters and my husband can't eat raw food).  It came with shrimp scampi, broiled lobster and seared scallops - all doused in the Marcel \"house\" butter (which seems to be am herb-infused compound butter or something).  IT WAS DIVINE! Before our tower arrived, we had bread service, which is pan fried bread brushed with the house butter and garlic.  It's also served with something similar to proscuitto, a nice serving of whipped ricotta cheese and some olives.  Again - SO GOOD!! I wish we could've had more!!  For our entrees, I had the fish of the day, which was branzino with brown butter and thyme sauce.  My husband had the New York Strip w/ a side of Bearnaise.  For the sides, we got the creamed corn au gratin and the Oscar Fries.   The Oscar Fries are not listed on the menu but Bonita made it clear that this is a favorite side dish that is offered \"off the menu\".  Everything was so good but those fries were to die for!!! For dessert, I had to get the bananas foster baked alaska (which is prepared tableside) and hubz got the berry galette.  Extra points to our waitress for pointing out that ice cream that comes w/ the galette is white chocolate fennel. Thus, if you're averse to licorice, you probably wouldn't like it. We appreciated this recommendation, as my husband didn't like it all (after getting a sample to try).  It was easily subbed out for salted caramel ice cream. \n\nAll in all, you can't beat the food or the service at Marcel.  It's five star and top tier.  It's incredibly pricy but worth every penny!!  Also, please expect to spend about 2-3 hours here as your courses are brought out thoughtfully so you can digest your food and enjoy each other's company.",

Sides came out before our steaks . No A5 wagyu.  Let's talk about their beef Wellington. For almost $200 it was extremely salty! You get 6 slices. The meat inside was tender but could barely eat it cause it was salty.   We ordered a coke during the time we were eating and my friend did not get it until after we got our check. The service could be better. Nothing at all wowed me about this restaurant and I don't think I would ever come back.",

The beef Wellington could use a little more mushroom to make the flavor more interesting. Bone marrow was rich and delicious. \n\nUnfortunately, no complimentary dessert for special celebrations, but overall great dining experience.",

You can park in the deck or valet. \nWe were seated as soon as the party arrived and had customized menus that said happy birthday for both the birthdays we were celebrating. Our servers were great in answering all questions as a few of us were first timers. We had great steaks and shared sides as well as started with salads. Everything was cooked very well and all tasted flavorful. We had lattes and dessert to end our evening and they were great as well. I highly recommend the steaks at Marcelo my sister in law is vegetarian and had the gnocchi pasta and said that was very flavorful as well. They also have great wine parings as well.",

The atmosphere was delightful as usual but I dislike how I am always sat (or attempted to be sat) at a hightop banquette. I arrived over 30 minutes ahead of the reservation. The wellington was bland, chewy (Med-Rare as ordered), and arrived with the pastry very visibly falling off and away from the meat. I really think the quality of the beef has changed along with the chef. The wellys used to melt in your mouth. I tried the lobster risotto and it was also bland with chewy overcooked lobster. The bread service was my favorite this visit. I don't remember ever having one piece of bread per guest served to the table initially. I guess cutbacks are real because I asked for more bread from four different employees but more never came as it was promised. Other than that our waters were slow to be refilled. I gave two stars for the single piece of fresh warm bread and the delicious West Coast oysters. Management did provide a free dessert once made aware of our displeasure with the wellington.",

        "text": "I will start by saying the food is AMAZING, well what we got. The food itself is the only reason they get two stars, because it was that good. The roasted oysters appetizer had a delicious herb flavor profile and it was different from your typical charbroiled/grilled oysters which enjoyed thoroughly. We also had the escargots(snails) and we tried it before at a previous restaurant and didn't enjoy, but we tried them here and to say it was my boyfriend first time trying snails and he loved it and I loved them as well. I am now a huge snail lover now if they are prepared anything like how Marcel did. The only reason we didn't finish our meal here is because our server was absolutely terrible. He barely came to check on us, we greeted nicely by a fellow server that we wish we had. Our appetizers came out promptly but waiting for dinner was awful. I use to be a waitress/bartender so I am pretty understanding but Mark was terrible and after we cancelled our dinner cause we were over the neglect and it's worst when the first server we started out with was waiting the table next to us and they sat after us and got their dinner before us and was pretty much half way through their meal by the time we just were done. I hate inconveniencing other waiters that wasn't appointed to us, but it was necessary. After requesting our meal to be cancelled and check, Mark was very rude and now we finally had his attention and apparently most of the staff as my boyfriend who looked very irritated we started to receive the attention and service we were expecting to have when we first got here. The table beside us had a very great server which irritated my bf more cause we started with him and got handed off to him. Mark hovered over us and rushed us to pay the bill, which we didn't mind. We just didn't like the fact we were being treated rudely and rushed due to the lack of service and professionalism from our waiter. He was a short dark skinned, flamboyant male. I would definitely advise to come here for the and the restaurant itself was beautiful and very nice. I will try again but I will sit at the bar which was beautiful when we came in, I'm a bar type of girl anyway, but my boyfriend wanted to sit down and relax. He won't make that mistake again and we can have a more up close personal experience.",

Amazing. \nFor entrees we got the Bone In New York Strip, Filet Madame, Pommes Purée, and creamed Corn Au Gratin. The steaks were amazing and cooked perfectly. The sides were good, and shareable. I would die for the Pommes Purée in bulk. Such a great side. \nWe ended the night with Espresso Martinis, and the Baked Alaska for dessert. We highly recommend the Baked Alaska- I loved that we got to watch them pour the fire and the sauce over it at your table, it was the perfect dessert to be a little flashy on my birthday  Marcel is such a nice intimate spot for a special occasion or date night! The service is always so impressive and make it an all around great experience to come here, even if you are just sitting at the bar.

My wife and I have frequented this place several times over the past year, and each time we'vs found something new and spectacular on the menu.\n\nWe love the cozy, dimly lit decor, and the service is impeccable.\n\nThe bar program is top-notch. If you like bourbon, I'd roll with the Man 'o War or the Grand Marquis. But you can't go wrong with anything from the cocktail menu.\n\nEverything we had on the menu was delicious. For appetizers, our favorite is the escargot, which drips with a savory parsley butter concoction that we sap up with the soughdough bread. I highly recommend the pomm frites and the salad Marcel.\n\nWe prefer the porterhouse for 2, served medium. It's cooked and seasoned perfectly. For dessert, you have to go with the baked Alaska. The presentation is amazing. They light rum on fire and pour it over the plates and the dessert. The result is caramelized bananas that are sweet, crunchy, and a slight hint of rum.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best steak houses in Atlanta. I highly recommend it for any occasion.",

So buttery and a tiny crunch mixed with oyster taste, delicious. Sweet shrimp scampi was so good and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. I ordered the lobster risotto and it's been on my mind since last week! The sweet buttery taste of the lobster in risotto is what guaranteed my love for Marcel! I had a taste of my friend's dishes, one friend ordered chicken paillard with pommes aligot and the way those potatoes were so perfectly cheesy, buttery, and potatoey all in one?! I nearly took over their meal. Our other friend ordered a filet madame with roasted mushrooms and while i did not taste their meal, i had some of the mushrooms and they were so good!\n\nI thoroughly underestimated my drink and only had one daiquiri and it was so good yet strong and smooth (i showed up already tipsy, ainno way i was getting dronk at dinner)\n\nOur servers were so kind and very attentive through out the night, consistently keeping our area clean and glasses filled. So, with that Marcel is now a favorite of mine. I'll see y'all VERY soon.",

        "text": "This is where you get steak in Atlanta!\n\nBring your appetite and your wallet. This is not a cheap eat, but it is absolutely delicious. \n\nFirst, they come out with bread and butter, like any other establishment, but my god it's just so good. I don't know what it is, but it just hits. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of shareables, including creamed corn, beef tartare, bone marrow, potatoes, and more. \n\nWe had some oysters to start as well, and they were delicious. \n\nI gotta say, the bone marrow was really really good. I wish there were more though, I think we must've gotten the smallest bone on the cow :(. \n\nI tend to always get the filet at steakhouses and I am never disappointed. This steak was absolutely delicious and the perfect size, cooked perfectly as well. \n\nI had previously heard amazing things about the lobster bisque but our waiter said they discontinued it; apparently it was too labor intensive for the staff and not worth it based on how the demand was for it. Here's to hoping I'll be able to try it someday if they bring it back!\n\nIf you're looking to treat yourself or celebrate something, and find yourself in Atlanta, go here. \n\n(More pics to come once my wifi starts working!)",

        "text": "The food wasn't so great this time. The mushrooms lacked flavor, salad was basic and the steak was just ok. This was by far my worst food experience at Marcel. Especially for the price, it was not worth it. 2/5 stars on the food. \n\nThe service was ok, no issues and the food came out at a nice pace. It was a celebration dinner but nothing was done to recognize it from our server. Usually they would bring out something to acknowledge a birthday. 3/5 stars\n\nThe ambiance is one of the best in the city. The place has maintained a sharp classy vibe throughout the years. Definitely one of the highlights of the evening. 4/5\n\nOverall it was 3/5 star  experience. And for the money I'd rather eat at Hal's or NY Prime. If I ever return to Marcel, I'll just get a burger and enjoy at the bar.",

Also, missing a birthday isn't our thing. Sounds like we missed several opportunities to really knock your socks off and we left them wet and soggy. Next time you make a reservation please reach out to me directly.

        "text": "I recently dined at Marcel with my wife to celebrate my birthday.  The vibe is definitely as advertised:  dark, moody and jazzy in the best possible ways.  The service is also top-notch; you feel very attended to from arrival to the final bill.  The dining area has a variety of cozy seating options so it's obviously a great place for a date or couples celebration.  The bar is very inviting and I noticed a few patrons having dinner there.  The food is also very good and while I don't normally comment on bread service, theirs rates a mention:  the focaccia is insanely good...apparently it is baked to order so it literally could not be fresher.  We enjoyed our entrees, though I confess my wife ordered chicken and I had the veal parmigiana so we will have to return to test their steakhouse chops (pun intended).  Her salad and chicken were excellent, and while my veal was good it wasn't quite as good as I have had at other restaurants.  The drinks were great from an excellent pinot noir to their custom take on an old fashioned.  All in all a very good meal; we will definitely be back for a future celebratory steak night.",
