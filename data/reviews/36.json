        "text": "First, when you walk in... already a vibe. They had the dj playing, smelled great, everything was so pretty and clean. \n\nMy friend and I sat at the bar and the bartenders were so nice! There is an hour and a half seating time at the bar when you get your meal, which isn't too bad. We made it in the time that we had. .. then you gotta move to the patio or a table I believe. \n\nThe food was great! The oxtail was cooked so perfectly. The hummus was great, especially with the roti, I love me some roti. The max and cheese was very cheesy but also had the perfect amount of crab... or lobster... (I can't remember) in it. We also orders oxtail pasta. But after those two appetizers... we were so full. \n\nThe drinks were on point! Definitely coming back here!",

A prime sign that they want you to spend on the quality of food and service. Secondly, the staff is phenomenal from the first greeting at the door to the bar and table service.  Shout out to Jordan, Tru, Ebony, and DJ Kenneth Style ( Live DJ during brunch).\nI enjoyed the Clase Rojas , Little Island Ting, Turkey wings, and the oxtail sandwich on today's outing. The flavors were outstanding.  A perfect complement to the ambiance.\nWhether you are a single diner or want to accommodate a group and you're looking for a place to exchange positive energy for a lively experience, Apt 4b is a must for your \"go to\" spots.",

We had alot of food forgot to take pictures of everything, sorry! \nFOOD: 9/10 for the Jerk chicken with the kale and rice and peas(chicken is spicy, fyi), 5/10 for the oxtail pasta, 8/10 for the Island seafood curry, 7/10 for the crab dip\n\nSERVICE: 7/10 our server was rushing us to order and we only had a party of 5, soo im not sure what the rush was about.\n\nAMBIANCE: 8/10 real chill \"apartment like\" vibes. hence the name I guess lol. Music was 8/10 around the time we went, which was 7pm-9pm\n\n****SIDENOTE: self parking is $10 and Valet is $15 (what a joke!) and parking is limited. You have to walk up a flight of steps to get to the front door(just fyi) . Also they only you to reverse a table for 2 hours, soo be on time! They DO NOT split the bill! Everything is on 1 ticket.  However, if you want to split the check they ONLY split evenly, and not for what YOU actually ordered(keep that in mind) OVERALL: I will give them a 3.5 stars(which is like a 7.5-8 out of 10)",

It was a little confusing finding the restaurant but I realized you have to go down the hill once you enter. Upon arrival we were welcomed with a smile and seated right away. It was pretty clean and just aesthetically pleasing. The waiter really knew that menu and gave us ALL the options! I ordered the Turkey wings with a side of rice & peas and cabbage. The rice and peas was great, you could taste how well they made it. The cabbage was seasoned well. The glaze they coated the Turkey wings were great, I wish it wasn't fried as hard and fell off the bone just a tad bit. I've been craving Turkey wings so it did the job. My friend ordered the oxtail sandwich and upon the first bite he was satisfied! Service was quick and there was no long wait for our food or anything. Literally got us in and out of there. The DJ was playing all types of music which started a vibe in there. Real cute restaurant for sure! Everyone was sweet and welcoming and I would absolutely come back here!! Everything was seasoned well, sad I couldn't try the Mac & cheese since they make it with sharp cheese, but otherwise! Definitely check them out!",

You're immediately hit with a mandatory valet parking fee of $15 without the option to self park.\n\n2 THERE IS A 90 MINUTE TABLE LIMIT FROM THE TIME YOU ARE SEATED!!\n\n3. Limited beverage options for non-alcohol drinkers. The options are \"flat\" water, sparkling water, then straight to wine and liquor!!\nNo tea, lemonades, or sodas!! \n\n4. Surcharge for everything!! The jerk chicken came with a huge mound of dry rice and a VERY small side of cabbage. We had to pay an extra $2 for jerk sauce for the rice!!!\n\n5. Some pros: As previously stated, the food was delicious and our server Jordan was excellent!!!",

        "text": "So coming up from South Florida, and looking for a place to have dinner, we found this spot online. The description read that the food was Caribbean and I said why not try. I was curious, on how the Caribbean food was in Atlanta. We first got an appetizer which was the crab dip, that was served with tostones and the grilled glazed octopus, both were very good. The octopus was very tender and combined very well with the cauliflower purée and chimichurri. Both appetizers were delicious. Next, I got the fried Whole snapper. I really like whole fried fish, and in the menu it said it was served with pikliz. When I got my plate I realized it wasn't the Haitian Pikliz, that I was expecting, which is spicy. It was not spicy at all and somethings like fried fish would be great with the traditional Haitian pikliz. The way, I can describe this... it's like ordering chocolate milk without chocolate. I also tried the oxtail stew which was very good. Both entrees came with rice an peas. The flavor of  rice and peas had a hint coconut just the way I like it, like at home. For dessert we got pineapple cake OMG that was the best. I couldn't eat all my food, it was a huge portion but definitely finished the pineapple cake. \n\nNow let's talk about the ambiance. This place has such an awesome vibe. They have a DJ who played alot of the music, I liked. Downstairs they have a lounge which sounds great to hang out if your spending a visit in Atlanta. Even though the pikliz kind of disappointed me, if I ever come back to Atlanta, I definitely would like to eat here again and try some other dishes.",

The bar has a lot of seating and some ppl elected to sit there the whole night. We moved to a table and I got the 4B reservation martini (also available on the rocks) $16. It was so good and very cute with flowers on the glass. Sting but not too strong. \nWe shared the Turkey wing app. 2 large Turkey wings, a little I've cooked and could have used more lemon pepper but still good. I had the vegetable curry which was luscious and a good serving size. My friend had the oxtails which was also large. The ambiance is great, bathrooms clean, service friendly. They charge 20% gratuity automatically no matter party size. I would return.",

        "text": "Went here for a girls night. The parking was a little confusing. Just know go all the way down the hill for parking. You'll remember why i said this. \n\nThe ambience was really nice. The DJ was set up around 5:30-6:00pm on a Saturday! Dim lights, open kitchen concept. Very chic. \nWe started with the fried oyster mushrooms, cornbread, and Turkey wings. Every thing was good. I honestly would say the fried oyster mushrooms and cornbread were my favorite. This restaurant does 5 courses but you don't have to order in sequence. You can order however you want off the menu. I skipped from course1 appetizers to course 5 and had the oxtail stew. Oxtail was flavorful, tender and fell of the bone served with rice and peas and sautéed vegetables. I would order again. My friend had the jerk chicken and it was okay. I've had better jerk chicken. I also did try their barbecue salmon and it was good with mashed potatoes. \n\nMy biggest complaint: I ordered a to go which was the grilled octopus. I probably should've looked on Yelp for pics before ordering. However this is considered part of their 4th course. I was not expecting an octopus tail with chopped tomatoes. It was so small for the price and looked like it belonged with the course 1 appetizer items. I ordered this with the jasmine rice. It was really disappointing. \n\nOverall it was nice. I would come again.",

The DJ was playing great tunes throughout our entire duration. \n\nWe had a reservation for Friday night which we were glad we did because it was definitely packed. When we arrived we were seated promptly and tended to immediately. \n\nI ordered the oxtail pasta, side of plantains, and the Clase Roja which brought my total to about $70 with gratuity included. The oxtail pasta was 10/10 with an ample amount of oxtail--they definitely do not hold out on you. Plantains were sweet and soft, just how I like them and accompanied the pasta greatly. \n\nI enjoyed the Clase Roja as well! It was a very refreshing drink and it seemed pretty popular as I kept seeing waitresses bring it out to other tables.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and I'm looking forward to coming back!",

Well I'm glad I decided to give it a try. \n\nIt's not too hard to find but can easily be missed from the main road. Parking is in the back of the building and it's free. Plenty of parking as well as the main lot was full. \n\nI had reservations but it was too many people in there. Could have gotten seated quickly without one. \n\nThe service was really good and the ambiance was as well. Reminded me of a sleek older record store with all the records on display \n\nThe food came out quick and was very inviting. I definitely recommend the cornbread. I'm a sucker for some good cornbread. \n\nOverall great experience and will definitely come back to try some the different entrée's.",

I had never been here before, but one of my coworkers had and she suggested it.\n\nThe Parking: If I'm not mistaken, Self park is $10 and valet is $20. They have a cashapp QR code for you to scan if you don't have cash.\n\nThe Atmosphere: Cool BLACK Vibes! Good music too. A good music of Hip-Hop and R&B. Even some Reggae and Afrobeats. Dope Black art on the walls as well. They have a bar, several tables and high tops. \n\nThe Service: The service was Great. Our waitress was super helpful. \n\nThe Food: I wanted the Caesar Salad, but they \"ran out\". So, I ordered the Island Goddess Salad ($16 - KALE, PAPAYA, AVOCADO, TOASTED CASHEWS,ISLAND GREEN GODDESS DRESSING - WITH JERK CHICKEN ($5)). This salad felt a little dry. Maybe I needed more dressing, but other than that, it was okay. \n\nIn addition, I ordered the Turkey wings ($18 - 2 CONFIT AND FRIED LEMON PEPPER TURKEY WINGS (FLATS)). SLAPPING! HITTING! All that! These are good. They are also super massive! The flavor is BUSSIN!\n\nTo drink, I had a Mimosa. I forget what they called it, but it was basically used with Passion Fruit. AMAZING! I had like three of em. \n\nOverall, I recommend. I'd love to come here during brunch.",

To say the building is nondescript is an understatement because it is in the same place as another establishment but once you get inside the vibes are all on high. We had to wait a bit for a table and were seated at a community table even though there were tables outdoors but since it was Friday at 8 pm we figured we should take what we could get. Our server was nice and the host staff even made sure my sis got a birthday shoutout from the DJ. We killed time as we waited on our food with the conversation card game on the table.

The restaurant itself was nice and a good vibe. Loads of vinyl records were everywhere. Our server Maurice was really nice and very knowledgeable about the drinks and menu. I had their spicy margarita. It was good and had a smoky taste which was different for a drink. We started with the fried oyster mushrooms and turkey wings. Those mushrooms were beyond fantastic! The wings were ok. A bit dry, but the skin was good. For entrees I had the lobster rolls which are technically another appetizer. He had the oxtails. Originally he wanted the jerk chicken but the server said they were pretty spicy and the table next to us confirmed. Honestly, we were so full from the apps we couldn't eat the entrees and took home. We ordered another round of drinks and took them downstairs to the speakeasy lounge, called The Bass Ment. It's a small space but had a nice vibe. Overrall we spent about $300. 20% gratuity included. The food will definitely have us coming back.",

        "text": "It started from Valet to the Host to the Bartenders to our Server! Absolutely Amazing!!!!!!! The vibe is unmatched! I have been to their sister location Ms. Icey's quite a bit; but I can tell you, this experience is unparalleled! The food, service and ambiance is elevated! Now let's get to the food! I had the Turkey wings.......1 million out of 5! Same for the rice and peas! Love love loved! We also had the plantain beignets.  Now don't expect the New Orleans profile of a beignet, but they put a nice Caribbean twist on it! Excellent! The choice in music, amazing!!  Love it! I am a whole fan of this restaurant group that are behind these brilliant restaurant concepts!! It was packed when my girls and i decided to come, and we came close to the switch over from brunch to dinner, and we did not feel rushed at all! Try this place! You won't regret it!",

I have really high expectations for places like this. We ordered the jerk chicken and the rice and beans that came with was luke warm and tasteless- the collard greens weren't good either. Truly shocking considering how flawless the corn bread, chicken, and ribs were. The ribs were fall off the bone and all the seasonings/ sauces were delicious. Perfect amount of kick. Would've given 4.5 stars for the disappointing sides but if I have to round it's only fair to round up.",

It was a very nice modern take to a traditional cuisine 10/10. \n\nDevil Eggs were fresh and cool to taste. Worth trying for sure. \n\nPaloma Margarita - delicious, light, and refreshing. It has a ginger kick to it if you are a ginger lover. Not too sweet, not too sour. \n\nAmbiance \nVery very cute bar and restaurant. It has Caribbean and hip hop fusion. DJ APEX x Was get food at feeling out the atmosphere and I went on a Tuesday for happy hour and it was bumpin. A lot of afrobeats. I cannot imagine on a weekend how good it must be for party vibes. The restaurant is spacious and well decided between a bar area and table and dinner area for those looking for both vibes in one. Free parking - at least on a Tuesday at 5 pm. \n\nService\n Wonderful and attentive. I can tell it was definitely slow but it's Tuesday and I saw quite a bit of traffic. The bartenders were very nice and hostess were attentive. \nwas wonderful and attentive.",

        "text": "This was my first time dining in at Apt 4B. I was with one other guest and we started with drinks and appetizers. The drinks had barely any liquor and the cornbread was just sweet...bland and cold. The Turkey wings were OK. Then we ordered entrees and before we could eat, the waiter comes over and told us our 1.5 hours of dining was up. We had to box our food to go. \nThe food was not as great as the hype and overpriced. Also, the entrees came out less than 5 mins after ordering....side eye.  I guess that is a part of the plan to rush the guests out. A 20-percent gratuity was added for a bill of $185. The added gratuity was indicative of the waiter's service...she clearly did not see any need to do above the bare minimum.\nThe lack of a great dining experience, for a place with such hype is not sustaining. To be constantly 'checked' on in an effort to speed us up was very noticeable. There was another gentleman that was walking around with an iPad that also kept coming to our table to get us to move along. \nThe charges did not match the experience because the food was subpar, the atmosphere was below standard, the music was too loud to have a conversation with the person next to you, and the service was as cold as the food. \nI received the overall best service from Valet and that is an additional $15 charge. \nAvoid this place... Unless you are looking to be underwhelmed and overcharged. It would have been somewhat tolerable if the drinks were at least good and the food wasn't cold and at least had flavor. I have had better tasting food and a larger portion....for less....at a hole-in-the wall.",

        "text": "Apt 4B is a Caribbean restaurant serving great food and good vibes! \n\nFood: Delicious! There were a lot of great options on the menu, so at first it was a little hard to choose, until I noticed the lady's plate at the next table. It looked mouth watering (and the waitress said the jerk chicken was really good tonight - I guess that means the right chef was there) so I went with that! I ordered the cornbread appetizer and the Jerk Chicken meal, which comes with kale, rice and peas. She was right, the chicken was REALLY good, and I'm sure it would have been even better if I didn't wait until I was full (and completely done with everything else) to touch it! The cornbread and kale had me in a chokehold, and so did the rice and peas which I dipped in the jerk sauce! And to think, I originally tried to sub those rice & peas for the mashed potatoes (because at most places it can be a bit dry), but I'm glad I didn't. BTW - no substitutions. Order the food the chef has curated. Now, I knew the cornbread would be good because this is the sister restaurant of Ms. Icey's Kitchen and iykyk... but  what I don't know is what in the world they're doing to that kale! I've never in my life had kale that good. \n\nMy friend ordered the short rib with mashed potatoes and we enjoyed that too. \n\nAtmosphere: It's a vibe! The outside actually does look kind of like an apartment building when you walk up. Inside is decorated with photo frames of Jet Magazine covers, black art, etc. There's a DJ. We were there around 7:30, so we were a little early for the dancing portion, but I think that gets started around 9pm. \n\nService: Great! \n\nParking: Tonight was valet only, no self parking. $15\nThat's where it lost a star for me. \n\nOverall: I loved Apt 4B! If you want a restaurant with good food and a vibe, this is it!",

Be prepared for a $15 charge for valet parking; however, as there is very limited parking in the area.\n\nThe food overall is very good. We had the oxtail sandwich, the cornbread, the lobster shrimp and grits, bread pudding (heavy on the rum flavor by the way), and the fried red snapper. Everything is very tasteful, freshly made, and quick to the table. I would recommend this restaurant as a good option for brunch.",

They kindly and quickly made arrangements for her to ride the lift. My other sister who has vision issues and mobility issues needed to use the restroom which was downstairs... They made a restroom available to her to accommodate her mobility issues. The bartender. Awesome! Off the chain! He made the best pomegranate margarita and the best Paloma I have ever had! OK it's the first Paloma I ever had but wow it was delicious. Did did a good job making recommendations and otherwise meeting every need. We also enjoyed oxtail hummus. I can't wait to finish up this review. So far so great! I'm here for a party. So I'm going to post again after the party to give a complete opinion. I am loving this joint!\n\nPost dinner update... I am happy to inform you that dinner did not disappoint. Several of us enjoyed the delicious and savory short ribs. What a wonderful jus it was served with! Another friend really enjoyed the fire roasted chicken. My sister loved the oxtail pasta. This evening was excellent all around....ooop!  I forgot to shout out The wonderful hostess. She was so kind and thoughtful all evening. She was concerned about the accommodations that members of our party needed. She was there when we wanted to take a group photo at the end of the evening. She was everywhere and she was on point! I think her name was Ayana but I can't remember. But she knows who she is. In fact even the attendants in the parking lot were awesome. I can't recommend this place highly enough.",

The decor is super eclectic and modern, but with a contemporary black spin and the Jet mag covers to match. There's an adorable bar with OK drinks... I had the Hey Amigo and it was strong but pretty pricey at $22. It's date night so we aren't pinching pennies, but something to note if you intend to come and drink and hang out at the bar. There's a DJ booth in front and the DJ was mixing old and new r&b and soca. YOU LOVE TO SEE IT!!\n\nIt's much bigger in the restaurant than I thought upon entering so they can fit a good bit of ppl in here on any given night so we had a ball dancing at our table. You get only 90 mins to eat , so also keep this in mind when you're coming for a date. \n\nTo eat we had oxtail hummus to start, and I've never in my life had oxtail in my hummus but at this point it's absolutely required. Sooo good! For my entree I had griot, which was FANTASTIC! It came with pikliz and green plantains. I don't really care for green plantains so I requested sweet plantains instead but they would not let me swap my side. We ended up just paying for the one I wanted... This is really why it's not 5 stars for me. It's a bit pricey, no prob. But at this price point I'd like the sides I will actually eat with my meal :/ \n\nAside from this one thing that may only be a big deal to some/me, I really enjoyed it here! It's a vibe, the music is great, and EVERY SINGLE THING I ATE WAS BOMB.",

        "text": "Great food and ambiance. We went for Sunday brunch and if you're a church kid you will appreciate the gospel hits mixed with your favorite beats,\n\nThe service is excellent from valet to the waitress and I really appreciate that. Atlanta is full of places with terrible service but this isn't one of them. Also Atlanta has a lot of Caribbean inspired restaurants and they don't always get the flavor right but the food was bomb and steaming hot. I ordered the Oxtail stew and the flavor was there. The rice and peas weren't dry and the portion size matched the price.\n\nThe cornbread was fire. My fiancé got the Ackee & Saltfish and it's the best he's had from a restaurant. The drinks were also good.\n\nWe already can't wait to come back.",

        "text": "wanted to do a last minute brunch reservation and APT 4B had space for my party of 4 for the next day. First off the vibe in here was just sooo VIBES. There was a dj that was playing good music (mostly r&b), lots of art work and a swing outside so 10/10 for aesthetic and taking pics. Service was quick & friendly - host sat us right away & waitress was always checking on us and brought us our bill fast. \n\nAs for food: the cornbread they brought out was AMAZING. I got the jerk chicken with rice & peas. It was kinda dry. My 2 friends got the stuffed French toast. One of their french toast was barely stuffed with anything and also she mentioned that it was really oily. My bf got a jerk chicken salad. He said it was good. All the portions were a decent size. \n\nOverall: great for pics and vibes, food is nothing spectacular. The corn bread is great tho.",

        "text": "Honestly I cannot rave about this place enough. The food was so so good. Literally some of the best food I've ever had. I'm Jamaican so I was deff judging the Caribbean dishes ! From the curry chicken dip to the oxtail pasta omg everything was so good. The drinks were really well made as well. We sat at the bar because seating was very limited. It was a busy night & we didn't have reservations but the staff accommodated us well. The energy & vibes were unmatched. Loved the Afro Caribbean mix. The music was on point. It was just overall a good vibe! \n\nThe only thing I would advise is if you get to go food to check to make sure everything is there. I ordered some extra food to take home & they deff forgot my sides which I didn't notice until after I got home. I will charge that to the fact that they were closing & maybe rushing. Also it was kind of tight in there because it's a little small but overall loved this place",
