It's been a while since I've been here and I've been remiss.  \n\nDavid was our server and he was very patient when we were indecisive and made some great suggestions.  I ended up with the pimento cheese omelette with a side of cheesy grits and my friend had the Hermes salad which was fresh and crisp with smoked salmon. We opted to split the French toast but honestly the portions are so generous we only took a bite. The food here is consistently delicious!! \nWe also tried the sangria. Very nice also.  \nThis spot is a local favorite but even if you're not local make the trip!  You won't be disappointed. \n\nSide note:  the have a nice patio for outdoor seating.",

                "text": "We came here fairly early on a Thursday morning, so it wasn't busy at all. There were a few groups of people scattered throughout, but we were seated in an area mostly to ourselves. Our waiter came quickly to take our orders. We've stopped by here once before years ago, and the menu has changed a bit. I ordered the Kirkwood Breakfast, which comes with scrambled eggs with Boursin cheese, a lavender biscuit, and your choice of meat. I usually eat chicken sausage since I don't eat pork often, but I opted for the regular bacon. (They also have a honey glazed bacon.) My husband didn't want much that morning, so he ordered the sriracha hummus plate and enjoyed it. I thought I'd love the Boursin cheese in the eggs, but it wasn't my favorite. I've only ever had one particular flavor and I love it, so I probably should've asked which flavor they use. Also, I couldn't taste any lavender in the lavender biscuit. It has little sprigs of lavender on top, but that's about all you get. My husband is an incredible cook and has his own lavender biscuit recipe that is phenomenal. I was excited to try theirs, but the flavor wasn't there at all. Just tasted like a regular biscuit. Overall, no complaints since I wanted something simple for breakfast. Just wish the flavors were enhanced a bit and that the type of Boursin was listed.",

Refrigerated focaccia bread, non-dressed greens, overcooked chicken, and tasteless Mac and cheese. The service was solid, but they missed my side of lemons, after asking twice, I just gave up. The coffee here is solid though, enjoy a latte while you endure the 30-40 min wait time. Revolution donuts is 2 blocks away as well, if your sweet tooth is bothering you.",

Great breakfast spot! \n\nThey have great outdoor or indoor seating. It was pretty slow that morning. But that equaled great service and super quick food.   I got the pimento cheese omelet and hash potatoes.  I did not need the ketchup I thought I may need for the potatoes.  They were very flavorful. not crispy but buttery smooth at least.  The omelet was fluffy and cooked perfectly. The  maple bacon or whatever and pimento cheese it was full of was very rich and delicious! \n\nGreat service with some really good food.

The Shrimp and Grits and French Toast were delicious. Service was lacking, with the server being mostly absent, and a mandatory 20% tip included in the check. Won't be going back due to the service and forced tip.\n\nSun In My Belly is a charming spot with a shaded outdoor seating area that's just perfect for enjoying a leisurely brunch. The weather was lovely, and the seating area had fans to keep us cool. It created a great atmosphere for a relaxing meal.\n\nWhen it comes to parking, there's a small area behind the restaurant that can fit around 20 cars, but fear not! There's plenty of street parking available nearby, so finding a spot shouldn't be a hassle.\n\nNow, onto the food! We ordered the Shrimp and Grits as well as the French Toast, and both dishes were absolutely delicious. The flavors were on point, and we thoroughly enjoyed every bite.\n\nHowever, I have to admit that the service left a lot to be desired. Our server seemed to disappear after dropping off our food, only reappearing when it was time to hand us the check. To make matters worse, a 20% tip was automatically included in the bill. Frankly, the service didn't warrant such a high tip, and it's a shame that it was mandatory. Because of this, I don't think I'll be returning to Sun In My Belly.",

                "text": "Table for 2 for Breakfast\nApproaching the restaurant, I noticed they had a very, very small parking lot behind the restaurant. Street parking was also available. Inside, we received a warm greeting and were seated in an ideal spot for a party of two. Our server promptly brought us water, and after a quick look at the drink menu, I went for a hot Chai Latte, while Wifey opted for a regular coffee. We needed a little more time to decide on our food.\u00a0 By the time our server came back, we figured out what we wanted. I chose the Omelet of the Day, a chef's special with corn, red peppers, broccoli, and parmesan cheese, along with a side of honey bacon and a lavender biscuit. Wifey went for one of her favorites, Shrimp and Grits, paired with a side of pork sausage. The food arrived surprisingly fast.\u00a0 I tasted my omelet and it was a little bland. I added some salt and pepper to spruce it up.\u00a0 Also, I didn't really taste any honey on the honey bacon or any lavender in the lavender biscuit. Wifey enjoyed her Shrimp and Grits, but commented that the grits were salty. Overall, the food was OK.\u00a0 Sun in my Belly is bigger than I expected with a bunch of indoor and outdoor seating, a nice cool casual vibe and ambiance.\u00a0 We asked for the check and one togo box, wifey had enough Shrimp and Grits to take home. When the check arrived it seemed high.\u00a0 After I inspected further, I saw the 20% gratuities were already added. Overall, we had a good experience. It is really a 3.5 rating, but the cool vibe and great service pushes it to a 4.",

                "text": "I have to be honest and say that this 2 star rating is based on my personal preference when it comes to my style of dining. So when reading my review decide whether we're similar or different when considering being a customer for Sun In My Belly.\n\nI ended up dining here due to the high rating and the food photography.\n\nThey have parking in-front of the business and a hectic small spaced parking in the back. (I'm unsure if it's for customers and employees or just employees)\n\nSun In My Belly gives an old home-felt diner vibe which I loved. Cake slices in the window set the tone.\n\nUpon walking in there's a automatic 20% service charge regardless of the amount of ppl dining. (So per bill). I think this is insane especially if you were to dine alone. (I understand for situations with bigger parties or certain type of elite eating).\n\nI ordered grits and shrimp with a side of pork sausage and a biscuit. The grits were good, I love to add sugar. The sausage gave me a \"frozen sausage\" vibe but it still tasted good. The shrimp was good but didn't fit the rest of the meal. The way it was seasoned gave a dinner vibe while eating a breakfast/brunch dish. (I'm very familiar with shrimp + grits and have ate it multiple ways so I did have a certain level of expectancy). \n\nThe homemade biscuit was nice and came with what I perceived as homemade jam.\n\nOverall I ate some of my grits, the sausages, a few shrimp and the inside of my biscuit. Majority of my meal remained on my plate. Not that it was nasty.. it just didn't go together well for me and I'm a very southern woman.\n\nThe size and cleanliness of the place definitely took away some stars. The wall I sat by was dirty and distracted me throughout dining.  My date ordered coffee which came with a dirty rim that we thought was stained. We learned differently when she wiped it and it came off on her finger).\n\nFor the 20% charge I'd expect top cleanliness & service (which was unremarkable).",

                "text": "I have had this restaurant bookmarked for over a year now. I had always heard great things about it and it clearly has wonderful reviews. Maybe I caught them on a bad day. I was at a site walk and afterwards my coworker wanted to have a late breakfast. I pulled up Yelp and low and behold sun in my belly was less than ten minutes away. When we arrived the place was packed but luckily the others waiting to be seated were larger parties so we only waited a few minutes before we sat down. The menu was predominantly breakfast with a few salads and sandwiches but I expected that. I decided to go with the PBLT and cheese grits. The sandwich consisted of pimento cheese, bacon, fried green tomato, lettuce with an aioli of some sort. I also opted to add the fried egg with an up charge. The menu read that it would be served on brioche but as you can see in the picture that was not the case. When I opened the sandwich I did rearrange it as it looked as though someone was extremely busy (which they were) and just threw it together. There was barely any aioli which made the sandwich very dry. The fried green tomato was hard. I know green tomatoes have a bite to them and I expected that but this tomato just wasn't ripe.  The brioche bread would've been much much better had they had it because again there was minimal aioli and pimento cheese on it, and the toast just was blah. I ended up just eating the bacon out of it. I scraped the small amount of pimento cheese and added to my cheese grits. The grits weren't bad but they weren't great either. I took a few bites and gave up. I basically paid $20.00 for four pieces of bacon and the fried egg I pulled off the sandwich. My coworker let me taste his sausage and gravy biscuits and they were hard, like they were day old. The gravy was ok but definitely forgettable. All in all, I left hungry and went to Chick Fil A for a grilled filet and scrambled eggs which I devoured. The restaurant was clean and the service was good as well however I will not be back for a second chance. If both dishes tasted were blah and lackluster, I simply can't justify spending money there once again when there are so many other places to try.",

We arrived late for breakfast and early for lunch and were seated right away.  By the time we left the lunch crowd was coming in and a substantial line was forming.  There is quite a bit of seating and they can handle a pretty good crowd.  The service was not fast, but super attentive and it takes time to make things right.\n\nOf course the most important part of any meal is the food, and Sun in My Belly did not disappoint.  It was really good.  I got the omelet of the day which included pulled pork, peppers and onions and was great.  My wife got the Demeter, a toasted sourdough sandwich with avocado spread, arugula, tomatoes, cucumbers, and lemon scented artichokes.  And the Demeter is even vegan.  My daughter got the PBLT, a pimento cheese BLT with fried green tomato.  Yes that is as good as it sounds.  We enjoyed the lavender biscuits and cheese grits as sides and cortado and chai latte beverages.  Everything was just great.\n\nThe only down side for me was that it was fairly pricy.  Our total was $62.98 for three people including coffees and tip.  Be aware the tip is already added to your bill so you don't need to add additional gratuity unless you want to.  I guess $20 apiece is not too much for a special occasion, but I could not make this an everyday place for breakfast.",

I can't wait to go back and get it again. I got the grits for my side and loved them. Everyone was very nice and helpful. Our waiter gave us great suggestions. Make sure your entire party is there as they wait to seat you until you all arrive which is typically in Atlanta.",

My Mom had the kirkwood breakfast with scrambled eggs, lavender biscuit and honey bacon, she enjoyed it! Our waitress was awesome and because it was on Saturday it was a nuce crowd there and only had to wait for 15 minutes for a table! I love this spot, will be back soon! The parking is minimal, small lot in the back and some street parking. The ambiance was cool because it was a beautiful day and everyone was out enjoying themselves with good food and friends.",

The waitress even walked to the area to check on the table next to me and still didn't greet me.\n\nNow i've been sitting for about 15 mins when a caucasian woman walks in and the same guy who sat me gives the girl options on what table she wants to sit at and ALSO brings her a glass of water. Then within 5 mins of her being there the waitress comes and takes her order while I'M STILL SITTING THERE. It was like I was invisible to them. When I got up and brought to the guy who sat me attention all he said was \"oh my bad\". Please if ya african american, don't waste ya time or money at this establishment!!! I don't even write reviews but they needed they asses cursed out. I took the civilized route.",

The flavors were all bomb. The croque monsieur was drenched in the bechmel sauce but was still crispy, and the fried green tomatoes were INSANE. Amazing presentation and flavor and crunch. Pretty decent service, though we went during a non busy time. Don't sit outside as it's right by a busy road.",

The brussel sprout slaw was the only item I'd love to try again. The cuban sandwich tasted like any other with toasted bread, and the fried green tomatoes were bland. The drink wasn't that strong either. My brother had a different sandwich, a PBLT, that he said was delicious. Wish I had made that choice. They also had a chocolate parfait I could give a go at again. The service was amiable, and the atmosphere was cozy. I might try them out once more, but'll definitely order something different.",

We love the decor and it is a much bigger restaurant than we expected, with plenty of seating indoors and outdoors.\n\nOur server was extremely kind and attentive and our food came out much quicker than we expected despite there being so many people already there for breakfast. I ordered the omelette of the day and honestly, I wasn't expecting much because omelettes usually all taste the same to me. However I really enjoyed mine and my friend who got the pimento cheese omelette said hers had a very unique flavor which she really liked! The lavender biscuit was our favorite! Such a soft biscuit with a beautiful flavor. We also couldn't help get a French toast as part of our \"breakfast dessert\". This was absolutely divine and not too sweet (we're not fans of overly sweet breakfast items). \n\nThe only downside is that parking is a little bit difficult. There is a small lot that can hold maybe about 10 cars but you'll likely have to find some street parking in the neighborhood. Granted, it wasn't too difficult but just keep that in mind when you're going in during the busiest times. By the time we were leaving the restaurant, it was 11 AM on a Sunday and there were many many people waiting outside. \n\nWill definitely be going back to try out more items on the menu!!",

It may look like an uninspiring egg biscuit and bacon plate, but looks can be deceiving my friend. Honey glazed bacon, a fluffy lavender biscuit, and scrambled eggs featuring Boursin cheese. Sun in my belly has taken a simple breakfast dish and elevated it to complex culinary heights. \n\nCreativity simply cannot be taught....when you have, you have it. Sun in my belly has got it.

Avocado toast was sad - thinly spread avocado on some basic toasted bread. Breakfast panini also nothing to write home about, grits were ok. Scrambled eggs are lazy. Automatic 20% gratuity to every order? Come on, at least earn it. Overrated for sure. Especially with how many great brunch options there are in Atlanta, you're better suited elsewhere.",

This includes soft scrambled eggs with Boursin cheese, your choice of meat (I got honey bacon), and a Lavendar biscuit. It was all DELICIOUS.
