Was able to find metered street parking for a small fee rather than valeting. Always greeted promptly when entering. No reservations beforehand. It was mid-week so they had tables available. However I would recommend making reservations in advance. \n\nExcellent service, amazing cuisine , and one of the best old fashioned I've had to date. My friends enjoyed their food and experience as well. It's an Atlanta staple that must be on everyone's bucket list. Next time I'm eating at the bar...",

We went last weekend for our annual Christmas dinner. We had two reservations for tables of 8. We asked in advance and upon arrival if possible to at least have tables near each other. The unattractive hostesses dismissively told us no in the most rude way possible. They could have at least been nice or pretended to try to accommodate, but instead it gave them satisfaction to tell us no and seat the tables as far apart as they could. One of the tables was then seated next to two giant empty tables that remained empty the ENTIRE dinner. We then had terrible slow service the entire meal. An hour passed and they had not even taken our order. Our final bill was over $3,000 and they couldn't even bother to be polite to us. We will never return. Sad to see what was once an amazing special place fall into the wrong hands, which have completely ruined it.",

        "text": "Went in for a late birthday&valentine celebration with bf. We tried to make a reservation close to the date two weeks in advance but everything dinner slot that week was fully booked. Glad we made it to the place. \nThe steakhouse is on the ground floor, the seating and lighting give you the feeling of being in a modern generic European restaurant. The tiles on the ceiling were delicately designed to preserve the double arch. My bf was very impressed by that. \n\nWe had the crab&shrimp appitizer. Seafood are very fresh but it's kind of just what I'd expect for the price? My bf is very impressed by the ribeye he ordered, \"this is the best steak I've had\" and mind that he usually doesn't care about food. I had the lamb chop. I'm very appreciative of their temperature control for meat this thick of a cut. Other than being a huge serving the lamb chop is also a meh-alright dish. I'm slighly picky about lamb because I used to live in the Middle East and the fact that you are living less than 15min drive away from the meat you are eating is hard to beat. Not the biggest fan of mint jelly, I'd appreciate a blend of herbs or a sauce of my pick over the stipulation. We ordered lobster over mashed potato and it's easily my favorite dish for the night. The lobster is steamed and cracked&peeled clean. You can tell the freshness from the texture of the meat. The mashed potato is saturated with a milky smell but not too heavy as a side. I would highly recommend trying it as one of your side as long as you are not allergic to shellfish or diary! We had cream brûlée as the dessert because I really wanted it. It's not as special, just around the type of you would expect from an upscale restaurant. Finished 2/3 of the serving and it does satisfy my dessert taste buds. \n\nThe service is alright. They pack the leftover for me to take home which is a nice",

The sides... avoid the macaroni and cheese at all costs. The chefs apparently forgot how to make a béchamel sauce because what I received was, ummm, different. Tasteless. Mashed potatoes... I've had better from KFC. Dessert - the bread pudding and ice cream were simply excellent. The banana cream pie? Lord have mercy... please throw that in the trash. I took one bite and literally couldn't eat another. I could break this dish down but why bother. The service was sub par for charging $500 for a valentines meal. The ambiance is just that traditional, stuffy steakhouse vibe that should stay in the 1970's. Not sure if I'd try again. Certainly better options in Atlanta.",

We already knew what we wanted to eat but with it being a busy night, our sever was gone alot. Since I wasn't that hungry, I ordered a few appetizer. I started with the Piedmont Peach cocktail, I was very sweet and tasted wonderful. I then had the Ceasar salad which was dressed well and the croutons were perfect, not too hard and not too soft. Lastly, I had the daily oysters. They were beyond delicious. I wish I was given some that were a little bigger since some were quite small. And I wasn't given any crackers so since the waiter was not in site, I just ate them straight out the shell. Overall, I had a great night and can't wait to return again.",

I also got a chance to taste the calamari which was also pretty good and crispy. \nI ordered the pan roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans with tomatoes of some sort with a sauce. It was amazing when I had a bite of everything. \nI also ordered the smoked gouda Mac n cheese& grilled asparagus. I did find the menu a bit mis leading. The entrees didn't say whether sides were included so I ended up ordering more food. I could have asked but hey. \n\nI can't remember the waitresses name but she moved a bit slow the entire night..so it was a bit frustrating.",

When we arrived, there was some back up with valet parking and it was super packed! The restaurant was beautifully decorated for the holidays and we were seated immediately. Our wonderful server took great care of us all night, along with other staff. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of Italian red wine to celebrate, and they offered us bottled water as well as some complimentary bread. I ordered the seafood trio while my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon black angus, medium, with Yukon potato mash and broccolini. My seafood trio is the one of best tasting entrees I've ever had! The lobster tail was perfect and came with a side of melted butter for dipping.  The Maryland crabcake was super delicious and well cooked. The salmon was just alright, but luckily I was already full from the other stuff. \n\nMy boyfriend loved his filet, and it was cooked perfectly with a red warm center. The mashed potatoes was delicious. The broccolini was okay, we didn't like that very much. It was a bit soggy and the seasoning was off. We will probably get the green beans or asparagus next time! We also got a dessert, chocolate banana pudding, which was great! It wasn't too sweet at all. \n\nAll in all, the decor and service was impeccable! The food was magnificent and tasted amazing. We can't wait to return!",

First, both of us ordered the 12oz Waygu/American Beef Ribeye medium rare - they arrived charred and appeared to be butterflied.  Second, we shared a big Italian $200 red wine - we were brought universal white wine glasses for it and had to ask for cabernet glasses.  Not something I would expect at a luxury steakhouse.  Finally - the serving of mashed potatoes were two spoonfuls at MOST - I mean seriously?   We left with a $600 bill and won't be back - too many other steakhouses that have better cuts of meat and not as pricey.  Chops/Lobster Bar have gone down hill...",

The streak was very savory, and they got the temperature just right. Definitely in my top 3 favorite steaks I've ever had. The Mac and cheese by itself was a bit milking but when paired with the steak, it was incredible. The potatoes were also great, however the asparagus was slightly overcooked.

We had a fantastic waitress that had an unbelievable grasp of the menu and made some great recommendations. We started off the with the calamari, that was really good. We also got the octopus but it was dry and a little fishy. I had the strawberry salad and I loved it. Let's talk about the lobster that they called the \"Rolls Royce\"of lobster. I got a 2 pounder stuffed with crab and it was next level. I would highly recommend !  My coworker got the Kansas City strip and the fried lobster on the side. He loved them both, I tried the steak and it had a great char !!! Cooked perfect, the green beans where astonishingly delicious. We also got the tots and they were perfect. There is nothing award winning with the banana cream pie, the crème brûlée was average. The chocolate cake was awesome (get it with the Oreo ice cream) my counterpart loved the breadpudding. The waitress made sure we left happy, even with a few misses.",

Some dishes were alright, my Lobster dish was $79 for two baby Lobster tails that was hard as rubber. Over all experience was lousy.\nWould not recommend this place to anyone I cared about",

We ordered Filet mignon medium and it was cooked perfectly. I got mine with a blue cheese cream topping that was delicious. We shared some sides and each got a chopped salad.

From the minute we arrived the service was outstanding.\n\nFurthermore, I cannot say enough about the commitment to one standard that was evident throughout our evening with everyone's interaction at Chops Lobster Bar.

Its pretty shocking because I've never liked either before, but I guess tastebuds change! \n\nI've asked many friends, \"Where's the best spot for martinis in Atlanta?\" and \"Where is the best spot for shrimp cocktail in Atlanta?\" and the resounding answer was Chops.\n\nWe had an upcoming dinner with friends that wasn't starting until 8:45pm, so we decided to have martinis and oysters/shrimp cocktail for apps So we made an open table booking, specified that we'd like to sit at the bar, and made our way there.  Whoa buddy this place was hopping on a Friday night.  Per our request, we were seated at the bar and were enthusiastically greeted by the bartender, whose name was tough to hear - we think Festa.  At any rate, he was jolly good company and made my first experience at Chops a delight.\n\nThe chops martini was exactly how I wanted - vodka, up, icy cold, with a lemon twist.  My husband got a gin martini - with regular Bombay - and it was soooooo good!  Highly recommend.\n\nWe decided to split the shellfish tower, which was plenty of food for us to both have two oysters, a shrimp, some lobster, and lump crab.  Because we were seated at the bar, it was served to us individually on our own beds of ice.  Everything was delicious and super fresh.  I would definitely order this again and repeat exactly everything about our experience at Chops.  Loved it!  I can see why its an Atlanta favorite.\n\nGetting in here was CRAZY - so crazy our Uber driver had to drop us off on the street versus pulling in.  Bring your patience!",

        "text": "Had my husbands birthday dinner here last night. We sat upstairs & started with Moscow mule & the west paces ranch water, they were both good. We had the half dozen east & west coast oysters. The east coast were very fishy tasting. My husband ordered the 12 oz black diamond NY strip. It was nothing special. It was actually very small for 12 oz. The broccolini was a little undercooked & had no flavor. I ordered the horseradish crusted grouper with a wine mustard sauce instead of the grapefruit purée. It was very good & would order again. The waiter informed us dessert was coming - didn't ask if we wanted anything else. We got a small slice of bread pudding cake, which was very dry & didn't have much flavor. \n\nWe were both a little disappointed with the service & food. Our waiter had a much larger party he was focused on. We waited a long time before we got bread & he came to take our order. It's understandable though - just wished for a better first experience. The restaurant was so loud we were screaming to talk to each other & our waiter.",

My girlfriend and I celebrated our 4 year anniversary by going out to an expensive restaurant and after exploring our options and reading reviews we decided on Chops. We have absolutely no regrets about this decision. \n\nThe meal was amazing with us both getting steaks( Filets) and getting sides of the mac and cheese and broccolini. I can say with confidence that this was the best steak I have ever had and we left satisfied. \n\nThe service was excellent with the staff taking care of our every need and being extremely polite. They all wore masks and were careful of distances. \n\nThe parking situation did cause us to park across the street. The parking on site is valet only and because we were not sure if we had to pay for valet upfront or after, we parked across the street at a Whole Foods and walked. This was because we were not experienced with this location and forgot to bring cash. We will be prepared for future visits.",

When we finally sat down, our waiter was nice but seemed a little all over the place. He asked us for our drink orders but hadn't even given us menus yet. We ordered our drinks and it took a while to get them. On the bright side, they make a great Old Fashioned. After he brought us our drinks, another 30 minutes or so went by and we had to ask him if we could place our orders because he hadn't come back to ask. We ordered and then waited a while AGAIN to get our food. We were seated around 8:15 and got our food at 9:45. I had devoured the bread basket by then because I was starving. \n\nI ordered the bone-in-ribeye with peppercorn crust and a side of the gouda mac and cheese. The flavor of the steak was okay but part of it was overcooked and well done. I was so hungry at that point, I didn't even feel like sending it back. I just needed food in my stomach. The gouda mac and cheese was better than I expected. It wasn't soupy looking as I had seen in some pictures and it had a hearty, richness to it. The other bright side...they played good old school R&B.\n\nOverall, it's a cool atmosphere but for the price point I expected better service and food.",

Our waitresses Denyse stated, and I quote, \"you are shaming the family.\" She made this comment because my husband picked up his tomahawk steak and ate the meat off the bone.  We initially noticed that she treated us differently than the rest of the guest in that section but did not expect her to make such an inappropriate comment. Although we was appalled by her comment,  we didn't complain to management. She knew her comment was not appropriate and she told her manager.  He voided our steak, we paid the bill and left a $20 tip.  This incident weighted heavy on my heart and I want the waitress to know that my husband is a licensed electrician for a multi million dollars company,  a successful business owner, a wonderful son, and an amazing husband. HE DOES NOT \"SHAME THE FAMILY\" he takes care of his family..",

        "text": "Was here day before Xmas. Made a reservation a week ahead and was able to get a nice table saved for that day. Arrived about 25 min early and we went inside to see if we could get a early seating. We entered from the ground floor but they told us we had to go up to the next floor. So we went up which you cant take the elevator or the escalator to the entrance.  We went inside and mention the reservation name and we were told to wait to be seated at the exacted time we made the reservation.  After 25 min our name was called up and we were seated to a nice area near the bar.\n\nthe menu was dropped off and 2 server came by and greeted us that they will be serving us today. We started off with some drinks. After 10 min the server came for our order and then dropped us off with some bread which I can say it was just WOW. The bread was fresh and hot.\n\nWe ordered:\n2 cocktails : Moscow mule and Smoky Manhatta. Very good!\n\n1 - Shellfish tower: which came with Lobster. oysters, dungeons crab claw and suppose to come with jumbo shrimp and lump crab but we didn't get them until I peeked at the menu and asked for it. \n\n1 - Bone in ribeye 20oz : This was cooked to perfection. There was zero problems about this steak. We ordered a medium rare and we got a medium rare. This steak recommended!!! oh steak came with Mash potatoes which I have to say hands down the best mash potatoes I have in GA.\n\n1 - Banana pudding: Omg my new favorite dessert. WOW so speechless. Please try when you dine in.\n\nOverall was a great experience, food was great the drinks were great the server was great as well. Why 4 stars? couple minor things like attention to detail would be nice. Like the mistake on our shellfish tower and when our drinks or water was low they just looked and didn't offer us a refill. Once all our food was out they didn't come by for a long time. We wanted to order dessert but we had to raise our hands couple times to get their attention.\nBut this restaurant is nice for a event or family's or even with your love ones to celebrate. Hope to make time to visit again.",
