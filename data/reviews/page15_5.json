        "text": "Oh. My. Goodness.\n\nI visited Fat Matt's on my boyfriend's recommendation (\"They're the best ribs I've had in my life probably\"), and I'm happy to report that it lived up to the hype.\n\nMy party of three arrived at about 7:15PM on a Thursday night, and was able to get a table indoors pretty easily. We ordered a full slab of ribs to share between the three of us plus an assortment of sides (mac n cheese, coleslaw, potato salad, collard greens, and baked beans). The sides were nothing shabby, but they paled beside the glory of the ribs. I would describe myself as a rib aficionado (as a child, it was my favorite meal and I would eat the bone clean). They're fall-off-the-bone tender, expertly flavored, and had plenty of meat on em. If I wasn't so stuffed, I probably could have finished a half-rack by myself.\n\nAlong with all the meat, we grabbed a pitcher of Sweetwater 420 on draft. The waitresses were a little skeptical that my young-looking coworker and I were over 21, but sent us on our way after some good-natured ribbing.\n\nIt's no gourmet interior, but it's exactly what you'd expect/want from somewhere called \"Fat Matt's\". At about 8PM, the band set up to play for the night and really brought the party with some bluesy music. We were sitting right next to the stage so got blasted by the sound, but it was still great.",

        "text": "Alright. I don't crave BBQ often but a friend really wanted southern BBQ as our first meal after landing in ATL. Fat Matt's was an excellent choice and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple, authentic, and delicious BBQ experience in Atlanta. \n\nI had the 1/2 bird (chicken) w/ potato salad & mac and cheese. I devoured most of my meal and took the rest of the chicken to-go. I'd say that my experience with good quality BBQ is pretty limited, but this one really hit the spot. The BBQ flavor was perfect and the sides were such a good complement to the chicken. I ate the leftover chicken the next day and still enjoyed it.\n\nThe space is pretty small and this place is very casual. We came for a late lunch so the place was empty. The servers were kind and I felt very welcomed. If I'm ever back in the area, I'd love to come back here.",

        "text": "Atlanta's rib scene is on point. After going to Fox Bros, I came to Fat Matt's two days later. Fox Bros had more of a dry rub, while Fat Matt was wet. \n\nI came here on a recommendation from one of my friends who lived in Atlanta for 5 years. It was quite out of the way so I didn't think I was going to be able to make it. But then my Uber driver HIGHLY recommended this place... so I had to go. \n\nThese ribs are fantastic. Full rack of ribs for $28. Sauce on the side. Their BBQ saucy is a bit more vinegar-y and sour. But the ribs were fall off the bones tender. Had a pint of Sweet Water by my side. \n\nAlthough these ribs were really good, I couldn't help but to think about the ribs I had at Fox Bros. It's not really fair to compare the two since its two very different style, I did prefer Fox Bros BBQ sauce more. But Fat Matt holds his own and you can tell its a local favorite by the line and crowd. I highly recommend both but personally I think Fox Bros had more my style of ribs.",

        "text": "I've been a Fat Matt's customer and enthusiast since 2010. I can still remember my first order, the BBQ Chicken, with Collard Greens and Mac n Cheese, it was love at first bite. I found myself there at least twice a week. The BBQ, more than authentic, moist, tender and always perfectly cooked, with a sauce that's SO GOOD you want to drink it by the glass. Work took me away from Atlanta for over seven years, but I missed Fat Matt's daily, but now back in the city, I am thrilled to say, Fat Matt's has not lost it's touch, the BBQ is still consistently GREAT! The staff is accommodating, warm and always professional. Whether I order the pulled pork, chicken or ribs, I'm always more than satisfied. The sides are equally mouth-watering , the Mac n Cheese and Collards take me back to my mother's kitchen. From start to finish Fat Matt's is just plain delicious!!!",

        "text": "Clearly the people rating this spot as a  Five Star BBQ are all from NYC or something.  It's good and probably the best one can get in that area, but only 3.9 stars, from my experience.  I went on Memorial Day and the line was 50 people long - leaving me to believe that this was gonna be amazing.  Unfortunately, it was not worth the price or the wait.  I spent $30 for a half slab, two sides, and a drink (pictured).  For some odd reason the lady working the register is also the gatekeeper of the ice....she seemed a bit perturbed when I didn't give her an exact quantity figure as to how much ice I wanted in my cup.  On a good note: the line moved faster than expected and I was able to find a seat outside (I guess most people were taking it to go)",

Hit this place on the right night and you'll fall in love with a pig and a chicken smothered in tangy slightly spicy saucy heaven.  Add a local brew and you've got yourself a winning combination.  \n\nRibs are St. Louis type and a bit greasy but that's part of the fun here at Fat Matt's rib shack.  Every time I get to the city of Hot-Lanta, I find my way to the shack.  \nPotato salad is house made and great.   Beans have a bourbon finish and are great.  No extra meat in them though.  \n\nThe \"bird\" is grilled on open flame. Smokey hint  and covered in a layer of the good sauce.  Nice.  It was moist and I enjoyed it down to the bone. \n\nSide of pickles added a little bit of a flavor balance.  Ask for 'em   This place has a vibe so amazing that itS sure to be a favorite for all.  Enjoy some bbq sauce to take home too.  I never leave town without some.  \n\nSorry about not posting pictures but i was so hungry and my mouth watered upon the table service.  Me likie!",

The service is great.   Get extra sauce with your meal and buy a bottle to take home.  Ask for center cut ribs when you order.  The ribs are far better than the chicken.  The pulled pork sandwiches with extra sauce are great.   Other bbq places offer leaner ribs and pulled pork that's just as good, but there is no place in Georgia, or anywhere in the world that comes even close to the bbq sauce and this is not an exaggeration!",

However everything is sold separately unless you get a chopped pork sandwich because it comes with chips and no substitution. We had chopped pork, 1/2 slab, greens, Mac and cheese, potato salad, chips and lemonade. The was almost $50. The food just wasnt work it. The chopped pork was pulled because when I see chopped I'm expecting chunks. The ribs had a weird texture like they had just been sitting in sauce all day. The mac and potato salad was decent, the lemonade sweet. We didnt finish all of the food. My friend that had the chopped pork just said it tasted weird and looked like school food on the bun. He just really ate his chips. I had been wanting to visit, now I have and I'm good.",

I wasn't a huge fan of the beans, but everything else was delicious! \n\nParking was limited, so I'm glad we Ubered, and there was very limited seating inside.

The ribs are good, tender, but with enough texture to still have a great bite. But they are devoid of any notes of smoke. I'm not one to douse my ribs in sauce but here I did for 2 reasons. The ribs were a little lighter in flavor than I normally like and the house sauce is delicious!!!! You also won't find brisket here, a bbq joint staple. The sides were tiny and served in small 4oz portion cups. Not meant for sharing. Really liked the collards and mac n cheese. Less fond of the potato salad and cole slaw. Matt's oozes character and has a few characters; both working and dining here. Loved the no frills decor and typical southern hospitality.",

There are posters and Relics of jazz music and musicians old faded BBQ signs that line the walls. It is a quintessential hole in the wall BBQ joint.\n\nThe food: I have the combo that features a quarter slab of ribs and a quarter of chicken both of which are doused in a sweet Tangy in a little spicy sauce.

Can I tell you that I was not disappointed..The rib sandwich was Hitting..The mac and cheese was on point and the collard greens, lawd ham mercy!! Somebody slap me please. I throughly enjoyed my meal. The live Blues guy was great also..he had a wealth of history regarding the blues to share with the dining public and he sounded pretty damn good. Parking is challenging so be prepared to deal with that.. We spent about 44 dollars to feed three people. All and all I was very satisfied with the meal and I'm looking forward to the next Fat Mack's experience..Also getting out the parking lot is a challenge. My suggestion is to exit through the blimpy parking lot if you can...",

        "text": "No fuss, great bbq spot with outdoor seating!\n\nI was brought here under the pretense that this an ATL staple that is not to be missed. I had some high expectations and, for the most part, Fat Matt's delivered on them.\n\nBetween our party, we had a combo (ribs and chicken), pulled pork sandwich, a side of mac and collard greens--yes, I wanted a taste of everything! It was all pretty delicious, fairly priced and decent portions (the sides are a bit smaller than expected, but great, nonetheless). All the BBQ meats had a similar taste which makes sense and can speak to consistency, but the ribs were my favorite.\n\nEnough outdoor tables to sit comfortably during lunch rush--with sanitizing wipes, utensils, hot sauce and napkins aplenty. Everyone seemed to respect social distancing measures so I feel comfortable coming back. If you're looking for a quick $10 lunch to hit the BBQ cravings this is your spot.",

Super cool spot for BBQ with patio outdoor seating and indoor tables with live music. \n\nWe got the ribs which were tender, juicy, tangy and very flavorful. It was a bit too sweet so I would probably ask for the sauce on the side. But that's just me (I got diabetes gotta watch my sugar intake). The Mac and cheese and greens were delicious! Didn't care for the white sandwich bread it came with. Loved their sodas and good choices of ice cold beers! \n\nStaff were attentive and friendly too. Will be coming back!",
