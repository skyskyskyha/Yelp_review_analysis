My chicken and waffles ($23) were sent back bc they didn't season the chicken and the waffles were cold. This was after they brought everyone's food but mine, it wasn't worth waiting 13 minutes - 5 patrons in the restaurant \n\nWebsite doesn't have the same menu as the restaurant \n\nIf this is going to be labeled a \"hotel restaurant\" the prices are appropriate, but if they're trying to make a name for themselves it's only a matter of time before it's closed \n\nGood things: the poutine  interior",

I cannot say enough about the exemplary service, truly special stuff here (extra special shout out to our server, Tony!). The cocktails were phenomenal, and the food was spot-on. I split the salmon salad thing with my mother-in-law, and I've never had salmon seasoned so well. My favorite dessert in the world is bread pudding, and Rowdy Tiger's bread pudding is up there with the best - baked and served in its own small cast iron skillet (!!). The ambiance is great - the space is broken up by big dividers, so the sound never gets too loud. The decor is modern without being annoyingly trendy. STRONG recommend",

        "text": "The menu was very limited and just \"ok\". The Bourbon Short Ribs were bland and lacked a \"Bourbon\" taste. Our food came out cold and we had to send it back. The first time I've bc ever been served cold foog from anywhere. The dessert was nasty. I had Peaches and Cream Panna Cotta and it literally tasted like peaches from a fruit cup dumped on top of some bland custard with toasted almonds on top. My girlfriend had the Banana Pudding and it was watery like before you actually let the pudding part gel overnight. The drinks were,however, very good. Overall I did not enjoy it enough to want to come back.",

The seafood stew was fabulous!\nThe real highlight of the trip though was breakfast and the absolutely amazing service. I had the pleasure of dining in Mahelet's section and she was a breath of fresh air - absolutely a great way to start the day! She's kind and funny and warm - just fantastic. Made me feel like home away from home. Both Mahelet and Ohan recognizes me the second morning and we enjoyed wonderful conversation. Such a treat to have such pleasant interactions in the morning - especially when traveling alone. Well done!",

We had such a great experience; the food was AMAZING, the drinks were delicious and the dessert was incredible! We started out with the BOURBON MOLASSES GLAZED CHICKEN WINGS which had a delicious sauce (not overly sauced either which was great) and the perfect amount of spice. For dinner, my husband and friend had the BOURBON ANGUS BURGER and I had the PARMESAN HERB ROASTED CAULIFLOWER and SHE-CRAB soup. I have had she-crab soup all over the country and this one was by far the best! Creamy with lumps of she-crab and a delicious base. We topped off our evening with the chocolate mousse cake for my husband's birthday which he devoured. Overall we had an amazing experience, great food, great atmosphere, great drinks, and great company! I definitely recommend this place; Chef Chris has created an incredible menu with something for everyone!",

Several staff members and servers had walked past during that time and saw me and my boyfriend waiting, but no one said a word. Finally, a short blonde haired staff member came up to us and said \"what can we do for y'all\". I told her we had a reservation and she looked baffled. Her response was \"for dinner?\", I told her yes and she left without another word. Two min later my boyfriend and I saw her back behind the bar doing what she was doing before she approached us. We then decided to dine somewhere else, which is unfortunate because I was excited about trying this place. To say it was a disappointment is an understatement. Judging from their terrible staff and lack of urgency and care for guests, this place will be closed soon.",

        "text": "I had dinner here last night with 5 of my girlfriends. We were the only table around 8 o'clock. Our sever, Tony, was extremely rude to me when I asked if I could sample some wine before deciding (mind you I'm absolutely okay with an establishment denying me samples). Instead, before me and my friends could finish asking for wine to sample, Tony walks away as soon as I asked for Prosecco. It took him what felt like 15mins to come back with my sample. He leaves AGAIN before we could order. When he arrives to take our order he rudely asked me, \" so you didn't like the Prosecco?\". Unbelievable. Me and my friends just looked at each other in disbelief. We had complimentary cornbread which was delicious but our main courses were mediocre. I had the Arugula Caesar salad. The chicken was dry as rubber and the dressing needed more salt. My girlfriend who ordered the same dish agreed. I got to try my friends Brussels sprouts which were over cooked. Once we got our bill we saw a 20% gratuity charge included in our bill. It clicked in our heads why the waiter took an eternity to serve ONE table. Needless to say, I won't be recommending this establishment to my family, friends, or patients. \n\nSide note: me and my friend drove around 4 times to find the validated parking deck the receptionist told us about over the phone. Unfortunately we couldn't find it so we parked at a public parking garage that costed $7.",

He was very nice, funny and also gave great recommendations on appetizers. We tried the fried green tomato caprese, which were so tasty and the pickled deviled eggs. We were also greeted by Chef Christina whom gave a great recommendation to try the bourbon short ribs. This was my favorite, the short ribs were amazingly tender, flavorful with a slight crisp from the collard greens. I can honestly say this restaurant has got it right and I can't wait to come back. Lastly for dessert I had the bread budding also amazing. After dinner we decided to head upstairs to check out the rooftop and just as you would expect, it's beautiful!

The drinks show up with small cubes and the waitress says they are out of big cubes. How do you run a whiskey joint without big rocks? \nWe order some appetizers to share among the group and the waitress does not have the sense to bring us some sharing plates. We found a manager (Glen) who brings us plates and says he will comp the drinks because of the big rock snafu.\nWe cash out the check and the waitress has added the comped drinks to the check against the manager's order.\nWe track the manager down and he takes it off.\nOverall, extremely disappointed with service, bar's capacity to serve up whiskeys and waitress was sub par.\n\nWe chatted with Glen on the way out and he said he was new, asked us to come back in a couple of months. He had the right attitude, so we may give him another chance, but tonight's experience was disappointing",
