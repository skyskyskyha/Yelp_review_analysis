        "text": "It was one of my co-worker/ friend's birthday dinner after work and it was a fun night!! Our server was very nice and friendly. \n\nThe service was relatively slow but it was a busy night. I will say though, at a table of 5 individuals, one of my friends food came out 30 minutes after everyone else's. The server continued to apologize, he stated the meal was prepared incorrectly and had to be started over. After the food was finally prepared, the chef came out and apologized to my table and friends very wholeheartedly for the delay and asked it would be okay to celebrate my friend with a few of their deserts. Even without the free deserts, just the humility of the chef to come out and smooth the situation was just so unheard of and I was thoroughly impressed!! THIS WARRANTS A FIVE STAR. \n\nFor my course, we started with the Salmon Chips (DELECTABLE). For my entree, I believe I had Tuna Tartare (I think....)  with the Convite Mezcal Esencial Espandin liquor on the rocks (I took a picture of this bottle! SOME GOOD STUFF).  For Dessert we were given the Chocolate Tres Leches and the Flan I think...  (YUMMY YUMMY regardless. \n\nThe place was packed but it wasn't terribly loud. The greenery room was perfect for after Meal photos. Id love to come back another day!",

        "text": "Visited Two Urban Licks for a business dinner and had a wonderful time. Beautifully decorated space and wonderful customer service. Our server was amazing and provided recommendations every step along the way. The first of which being the salmon chips - one of their top sellers - which were absolutely delicious. I didn't really know what to expect when they were brought out, but I knew that I had to order them, and I was not disappointed at all. We also got the Kentucky fried cauliflower and salt and pepper calamari. I would without a doubt recommend both of these as well. I love calamari and order it at almost every restaurant that I go to and this very well might have been some of the best I've ever had. The cauliflower was seasoned and crispy and the sauce really pulled it all together. \n\nAfter all of those apps, I wasn't too hungry, so I got the spicy Caeser salad and brisket empanada for my \"meal\". The spicy Caeser had a great flavor and was actually very filling. I wasn't a big fan of the brisket empanada at all and ended up only taking a bite out of it. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the key lime crème brûlée and it was delicious. The only comment would be that it could've been a little thicker. \n\nMy group wasn't too big of a fan of their main courses and one stated that \"they might just want to stick to apps\" so not sure how much other menu items would be recommended. But for a quick drink and bite I think it's a great place :)",

Inside its a converted warehouse with a nice decor.\n\nI ordered the up in smoke bourbon drink and it was prepared really good so we was off to a great start.\n\nAppetizer was salt and pepper calamari with red chili sauce. It taste a lot better than it looked. The sauce made a big difference. The sauce was sweet tangy and it went well with the Calamari.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the rotisserie chicken. I usually don't order chicken when I go out but it looked so good. Not only did it look good, it was good, not too dry and the Mac and cheese that came with it was exceptional.\n\nWe didnt order dessert we opted for another round of drinks.\n\nThe restaurant was clean, the wait staff was extremely friendly and the rest room was immaculate.",

        "text": "My friends and I went to Two Urban Licks for dinner on a Thursday evening. We had reservations for 6pm, and we were seated right away. The interior was giving me modern industrial vibes. I couldn't see the performer from where our table was located, but I could hear a live performer singing an acoustic set in the restaurant. \n\nService was great. We had a big party, so two servers covered us during our dining experience. They were friendly and highly attentive. Big plus that our food came out in a timely manner as well.\n\nI was overall satisfied with the food. We shared a few appetizers, I got an entree, and then we capped dinner with a few desserts.\n\nCalamari - Lightly battered and well seasoned.\n\nFried cauliflower - These were delicious! Great fried cauliflower is hard to come by in my opinion; I often find them soggy. These were crunchy and remained crunchy even after being covered in a tangy sauce.  \n\nBrisket empanada - This was one large brisket empanada cut into two. Loved the piece I had. \n\nTuna tartare - This was fairly average, so I would skip on this next time. \n\nGrilled Hanger Steak - Should've got a different beef dish. I tried my friend's smoked brisket, which was juicy and tender. A couple of other friends got the Beef Rib, and they said it was amazing. I honestly enjoyed everything else on my dish (asparagus and potatoes) but the steak itself. I ordered the steak medium, but it was a bit dry for my liking. \n\nSweet Potato Cheesecake - Enjoyed this. \n\nUpside Down Pineapple Cake - What a nice treat! I don't typically like upside down pineapple cake, but the cakey part was super moist. \n\nFried Pie - Not my favorite dessert of the 3 since it was the most basic. But hey, it's apple pie, and who doesn't like apple pie?",

        "text": "I finally got a chance to check it out for a late birthday dinner. There were so many good appetizers on the menu to choose from.  Most people raved about the salmon chips, but we thought they were just ok. We didn't expect the salmon to be chilled. We enjoyed the calamari.  It was tossed in a nice sweet and spicy sauce. The cauliflower was flavorful. I wish it had more crunch. Finally, we got the brisket empanada. It was cut in half and drizzled in an orange sauce, cheese and diced tomatoes. We also ordered the greens and mac n cheese. We spent $89 for the 4 apps and 2 sides. The service was great. They brought out a small, chocolate birthday cake after our meal. I will return and try more goodies on the menu.",

        "text": "I used to love this place, but maybe after 20 years it's seen it's better days?!  We went for lunch/had a reservation, greeted averagely, but excited to get some nourishment before NYE.  Server Devin - top notch nice guy, but not set up for success in my opinion.  We ordered the items pictured,  a burger , and a salad.  It took 25 minutes to get our cocktails-Strawberry B /Bloody M.  The restaurant wasn't crowded and close to the end of lunch time.  Devin returned to tell us that he was informed that they were out of burgers(he wasn't informed)?  I pivoted and got the Salmon Chips- they are always good and consistent.  The table next to us used to live in the area and had come back for a little reunion of establishments in the hood.  They were experiencing a problem waiting for the food/unhappy/nice, where his wife received her entree and he waited 45 minutes for an omelette.  Their comment was that they loved this place, but it isn't the same.  We were all sad.  Then came the bill- so please check what is on the tab and what is printed on the menu.  Empanadas had $18 on the menu and on the tab $28.  Calamari was $18 on the tab and $15 on the menu.  The manager made the situation correct, but it was not the relaxing moment we were hoping for at TUL!  The restaurant needs a refresh and likely some new management-I wish them all the BEST, because they were an anchor on the Beltline before it all existed!",

        "text": "This place is a must try according to the locals. I'm glad I did. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon (right before the end of brunch). Reservations were made through OpenTable but you didn't need them. Plenty of seating available at the huge bar. \n\nFor appetizers we chose the Spicy Salmon Caesar salad and the empanada. Loved the spicy salmon, it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The salad itself was extremely dry. I didn't care for the caesar dressing either, again, loved the salmon. \n\nThe empanada was pretty good. Loved the flavors, did not love the sauce it was practically smothered in. \n\nFor brunch entrees we shared the fried chicken biscuit with sausage gravy and the shrimp and grits. Loved, loved, loved the fried chicken biscuit. The gravy, the seasoning, the juicy chicken, the biscuit had rosemary or chives in it (can't remember which one) but it was so good. Easily one of the best fried chicken biscuits I've ever bit into. \n\nThe shrimp and grits were good but nothing special about them at all, good, but I've had better plenty of times. \n\nI was celebrating my birthday, the server was nice enough to bring out a small chocolate cake with an edible chocolate Happy Birthday sign. Such a nice gesture. The cake itself - hard pass. Way too dry! We also ordered coffee Creme brûlée and apple bread pudding. I'm a Creme brûlée girl and coffee lover but didn't enjoy this at all. The caramelized sugar taste extra burnt and I didn't care for the taste. The apple bread pudding served with a scoop of ice cream on the side was the winner here! \n\nFor cocktails we tried the Aviator or Aviation (can't remember the name). Gin cocktails! Delicious!! We ran that back twice. They're strong and tasty. No Bombay gin here, Hendricks. We finished with 2 Hendricks and tonics with limes. Heavy pours, no complaints. \n\nWill visit again when in Atlanta.",

        "text": "I hadn't been to two urban licks in at least a decade! I don't know what I expected, because it had been so long. However, it brought back awesome memories. \nCarlos was my server, and he was beyond perfect. I can't even think of a word to describe how awesome he was. He worked hard to make sure that I had the best visit possible! \nThe environment, is just as I remembered it you walk in and smell the wood-burning stove, which sets the mood, there's live music playing in the background, and it's a mellow, fun, friendly atmosphere overall. \nI ordered the Mocktail, and enjoyed it immensely. \nI also ordered the burrata and melon salad, which came with crispy prosciutto. Oddly, it almost makes you think of a Panzanella salad, because of the large amount of croutons. However, the overall product was so good, this wasn't a major detriment to the dish. Before taking it home though, I definitely removed most of the croutons so that they wouldn't turn to mush before I next had a chance to eat the dish. \nI also had the Kentucky fried cauliflower and I'm not sure why the dish is named this way. Nothing about the dish would remind you of Kentucky fried chicken, it is more of a Thai inspired dish. that is wonderful to eat. I truly enjoyed it! I was only confused by the name. \nFinally, I had the scallops and polenta dish, which was very good as well. At this point I was full, so I probably didn't enjoy it as much as I would have had I eaten it on an empty stomach, but the scallops were seared to perfection. The polenta was tasty. It was seasoned well, and not too thick not too thin. All of the little accoutrements around the plate also complemented the dish perfectly. I would definitely order it again. \nFinally I ordered the granita for dessert. The thing that made Carlos the best server in the history of the earth has to do with my sister, who was home ill. She wanted the granita when she saw it on the menu, but given that we live 20 or more minutes from the restaurant, she knew there was no  way that I was going to get a frozen ice dish to her before it melted. I shared my concern with Carlos, and he made it happen packing the granita to go in another container with ice and salt the same way your grandmother used to freeze ice cream when you were a kid. That granita made it to my sister, still frozen and made her night! A special thank you to Carlos and two urban licks for making it happen! I don't know why it's been so long since I last visited, but I can assure you, it won't be nearly as long before I visit again!",

Keep it simple and tasty.\n\nThe menu is via code and you pay through your phone.  As you decrease the role of the waiter and put that on the customer why should I leave 20%?

First off there is a lot that come out so highly recommend if you're in a party of at least 2 or 3. It wasn't overly salty and the chips had a great crunch. \n\nFor my entree I ordered the seared diver scallops and they were cooked perfectly.

The calamari was very different from other calamari I've had and I liked it a lot; it was sweet, tangy and had a little heat as well.

There were no fans, barely and shade, but we made due. \n\nThe food was ok this time around, my mother in law ordered their burger- well done- and it came out pink TWICE! She's not the type to send her food back, but the burger seemed barely cooked, she couldn't stomach it.

SO good! The salmon was cooked just right and everything was seasoned to perfection. I want to try other items next time but this dish might just win out again.\n\nWe also ordered a bread pudding that I really enjoyed and recommend everyone try. \n\nThe ambiance was superb!

The calamari, the salmon chips, and the empanadas are my favoriteeeee! Otherwise the food is pretty good. I got the steaks and fingerling potatoes my first time and it was cooked perfectly, I loved everything. The second time a i got the chicken and macaroni & cheese and the chicken was pretty dry; I wouldn't order it again.",

My good friend and I ordered four dishes and it was too too much food.\n\nSo maybe it's not actually that pricey and I need to just order less.\n\nIn any case, the flavors and techniques here are kind of a meld of Asian, Mexican, and Southern American that come together in a way that most closely evokes comfort food in my opinion. This is not a bad thing. Lots of smoky, spicy, and sweet flavors.\n\nThe calamari is not to be missed and can serve probably 4 people.\n\nThe empanadas are also delicious, but a bit of a misnomer because it's two halves of a single empanada.\n\nI did like their brisket, I'd ask for the sauce on the side next time because the meat by itself was delicious.\n\nCheck this place out and consider that each dish is, in fact, large enough for at least 2 people.",

There is valet parking for $3 or self parking also $3. \n\nWe had reservations so we were seated right away. We ordered the salmon chips and crab cake as an appetizer. Both were extremely good. As i looked around i noticed everybody ordered salmon chips. lol that should tell you a lot. I also ordered the two punch for a drink that is like a sangria. The 2nd drink i ordered was the strawberry bounce . It was too strong for me. Couldn't taste any strawberry. But if you like Gin this is the drink for you. \n\nFor our entrees we ordered the fried duck and hanger steak. Both very good. My sides to my steak were cold but the waiter brought out some fresh hot sides to fix that. More than enough.. \n\nTo end our date night they brought us out a complimentary chocolate cake bc we were celebrating our anniversary! I am not a fan of chocolate cake but this cake tasted good and the icing was top tier! Lol  All and all the service, food and ambiance is great! I def recommend!",

It had been a compulsory dining experience for the previous 6 years...\n\nI am very happy to share with y'all that they've returned to their roots and are delivering 5 star service and cuisine.  \n\nMost notably, they've expanded their small plates, thus we opted to make a quasi tapas experience out of it.\n\nWe had the salmon chips, of course...excellent as always.  Next we shared the Nashville Hot fried oysters.  Perfectly fried and tasty oysters.  Subtle heat in the sauce and pickles.   Choppas bread was crispy and made a great vessel for an amuse bouche bite - one per oyster!  \n\nNext was the Creole shrimp.   Wow.  The blackening seasoning was on point!\n\nEmpanadas were the final gastronomical adventure.   They were filled with house smoked brisket.  Not greasy!  Dough was perfect - just enough crunch.   \n\nI had an old fashioned with Basil Hayden.  My wife has a Grey Goose Cosmo.  Drinks are a tad in the small side but hey, it's not a bar or a lounge, so...\n\nAll in all we were very impressed.  If we'd been blindfolded, I would have guessed we were in New Orleans when eating the Creole shrimp and in Nashville when eating the oysters.\n\nAnd kudos and thanks to the staff for recognizing that we were repeat customers and honoring my seating request and for the birthday treat!!",

I just recently came here and I was impressed thoroughly as this place was recommended by a coworker. \n\nThe vibe of this restaurant was perfect with so much natural light and plants. It smelled like a family barbecue and was cool to see the pit they had (not sure If that's what it is). \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and helped us recommend the Kentucky fried cauliflower. This was one of the best appetizers I've had in a while. I was able to order pizza from the brunch menu for my entree and it was so good! \n\nNext time I'm Atlanta I'm definitely coming back!

        "text": "My family and I took my mom to Two Urban Licks when she visited recently from out of state. We always use free Valet for parking and tip generously. We made reservations for 2:15 via Open Table. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the host at the front desk. She was not the friendliest so we requested a manager to handle our seating who was polite and slightly understood our need to be near open air ventilation. TUL sits right on the Beltline and has outdoor and indoor seating with a pretty laidback vibe. Dress is business casual. They cannot guarantee outdoor seating but if you can get it, it has a nice view of the Beltline with large and small tables; most with umbrellas. Otherwise, it's pretty tight and loud indoors so it's not a place I recommend for a romantic date. Our server seemed to have too many tables which compromised service and wait times. She had a good personality so I didn't hold it against her. (A couple in my party were not so forgiving LOL!) \n\nYou must use a smartphone to view the QR menu. My mom (80+) would've been lost if she had been dining alone so I suggest they make adjustments with disposable menus for those not tech savvy. We ordered French toast, shrimp and grits, chicken biscuit without gravy, steak and eggs, empanada, and salmon chips along with mixed drinks, a mocktail and a beer. Once we tasted our drinks, we all had the same tight lips and eyes because they were so sour. We were able to flag down down our server to get simple syrup. What a lifesaver! We've had the salmon chips before and they were always delicious but not so this time. In fact, we left some which is crazy considering four chips come on a platter and there were five of us. During our visit, TUL had a closed brunch event on the patio so I'm wondering if cooking in bulk jeopardized the taste of the chips. \n\nMy daughter requested a replacement for the shrimp and grits. She didn't like the cheese after taste which is unusual because this is one of her go-to dishes. The French toast is called Fat Elvis for a reason. It is a large portion. If you \"love\" sweets, then this is for you. We expected bacon strips instead of crumbles. The empanada was delicious but beware it is very small for $14-15. The chicken biscuit was so big that my mom spread it out in her plate. Let's just say she was pleased. However, the real winner was steak and eggs. We've never been for the day menu and won't do it again. It's night menu from now on. If you like checking the menu beforehand, be sure to use the menu from the TUL website for accuracy and not the Google menu. I gave the four stars for the overall ambiance and experience. Enjoy!",

The calamari had a great sauce, but was a little overcooked, so a bit hard and chewy.  \n\nThe king crab appetizer was excellent, I highly recommend it.  My daughter said the brisket empanadas were fantastic and the salmon chips, per usual, were great. \n\nWe also ordered a crabcake, but were too full to eat it, so my daughter took that home with her. It is smaller in size so definitely an appetizer versus a meal. \n\nLastly, they provided a complementary chocolate birthday cake, which we also didn't eat because we were too full.\n\nSuch a great vibe and ambience, but kitchen and bar service was extremely slow. I still recommend going, but you might want to go during the week.",

        "text": "I visited Two Urban Licks with three friends to celebrate my friend's birthday on a Saturday night around 8:30. They had valet for $3-8 and free self parking. The sign said free validation, but the price ended up being reduced to $3 from $8 before gratuity. \n\nThe indoor atmosphere was very soft and welcoming with dim lighting, music playing and nice decor. It smelled amazing like someone was cooking up quality food, with flavorful seasonings. Upon sitting, our waiter greeted us and filled our glasses with water. He took our drink orders and we took our time to scan the QR codes and look over the menu. \n\nWhen he came back with our drinks, I ordered a Teremana margarita, since they did not have Casamigos on the bar. I wanted the Aztec drink, until I saw it had jalapeño. The margarita was okay, but I missing some sourness. I would not order it again. My friends liked their drinks, but I did not catch the names of what they tried out. \n\nI decided to order the beef empanadas appetizer after hearing a friend recommend them and the hangar steak entree, which included fingerling potatoes and asparagus. The beef empanadas appetizer was PERFECT. Absolutely delicious. They were cooked with a nice crisp texture, the meat was well seasoned and my plate had this melody of herbs, spices and veggies with feta cheese. OMG!  I wish that I would have ordered two plates of those and left the bill at that. My medium hangar steak was disappointing. It lacked flavor and was extremely underwhelming after having those empanadas. Another friend ordered the beef empanadas also and she loved them too. She was not as happy with her main entree either, (I don't recall what she ordered).\n\nThe bday girl ordered salmon bites appetizer and mussels. She loved the salmon bites but felt that the mussels were too spicy. Another friend ordered a fish entree and felt that it was small but flavorful. \n\nWe talked over dinner, some friends ordered additional drinks and then we had the opportunity to pay our bill through the QR code. It even allowed us to split the bill to cover our specific items and add gratuity. I appreciated the convenience of that! Overall, I would return in the future for the appetizers and even consider a different entree, perhaps for Brunch. I enjoyed taking pictures inside and outside and enjoying the vibes. I am still thinking about the empanadas too.",

And the salmon chips were also very good.  We also had freshly baked bread to sop up the juice from the mussels.  The drinks are reasonable and the wine pour was very nice.  We walked from to Ponce City market and shopped and enjoyed the evening.  The dress at the restaurant was casual and it was Friday night the restaurant has a nice crowd.  They have a patio with heaters and fire pits.  I believe the next time we visit it will be to meet friends on the patio for drinks and appetizers then a long walk on the belt line!",

The staff placed us in a perfect location for the pup, brought us some water, and stopped by to tell her how cute she was throughout the afternoon. At the time I thought it was nice of them to help calm my dog down, but they were actually helping me relax! \nFood- So many options but the salmon chips are a must on every visit. I tend to go for the scallops or chicken for dinner. During my last visit I ordered the shrimp and grits and they were amazing!

        "text": "Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night. The atmosphere and ambiance here is pretty cool, but a highlight over the food. I felt the vibe overcompensated for the food, and this spot is better suited for drinks and small bites. \n\nThe food was decent, but nothing memorable that would make me come back and order again. I also felt service was lacking having received some attitude from both the server and host, leaving me to wonder \"What happened to southern hospitality? \"\n\nBelow are the dishes I tried/ ordered:\n-SALMON CHIPS\n-KENTUCKY-FRIED CAULIFLOWER\n-CRISPY DUCK LEG (as my meal with a side of mac and cheese)\n-a glass of ALBARINO\n\nThe ALBARINO was the best part of my meal.  2nd place goes to the cauliflower appetizer ( the honey and mild heat made the cauliflower pretty yummy). 3rd is a tie between the salmon chips and the side of mac&cheese, as they were both solid in flavor profile and dish presentation.\n\nAs for the crispy duck, it was crispy -the end. I love duck, but this duck had more fat than meat and it seemed under-seasoned of any flavor to make the dish pop( ps I am not a fan of salty food so when I say seasoning I mean any other type of seasoning to elevate the meat). And the cherry sauce for the duck didn't elevate the dish as much as I had hoped.\n\nWhile I ordered an appetizer as my meal, I didn't receive it until 10 min before we left and 30 mins after my colleagues' dinner salad ( I was the last person to receive my dish) . The live music had keep me company as I waited for an underwhelming duck dish.\n\n\nEither way, happy dining and drinks y'all ! Hope you have better luck.",
