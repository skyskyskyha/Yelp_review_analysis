The young man actually serving me was nice but, I had to ask him for a straw and lemons 4 times. Too many tables I guess. But Angel made up for it she was nice and got me what I wanted. And checked to make sure it was to my liking. I always liked Beetlecat because pre covid, I was always at Inman park doing something. And I did miss it. I had for the first time the captain's favorite, with a side of lobster, and a tiki mocktail which was not big enough but tasted great. It was all delicious, hot and fresh and did not take long to come out at all. Love this place. I didn't know they did brunch. Very good stuff. I got there at 10:30am sharp. They opened at 10am, and it was already packed inside and outside seating. Go early.",

My friends shared a Fish House Punch pitcher and from the looks of them it packed a punch. We had the fry bread for an appetizer. Delicious. It's herby and sweet. They had oysters and enjoyed them. For entrees we had the lobster roll, double cheeseburger and coconut fried rice. The rice was the star!!! I know they are known for seafood and both the burger and lobster roll were good. But the rice was great! The plantains have a nice texture and sweet nice. It went well with the savory rice flavors. I highly recommend grabbing that when you go.",

I opted for the blue crab omelette, and was still hungry after eating the entire thing. The donuts are average, they are all really just plain donuts with glazed topping or cookie crumbles on top. Our server was outstanding, they have a cute outdoor patio, and there is even a den downstairs with a full bar. I would definitely return, but would probably eat before I go, so I will not be starving.",

        "text": "We had company from Europe in town. I mean, honestly, nothing compares to the luxurious architecture and design of European restaurants. So we went with an American Brunch approach to avoid the comparison of overseas. We were not disappointed. The appeal of the nearby Beltline, to walk off your food coma, helped us pick this location. I want to applaud the main chef for the unique menu and the interior designer for the well-themed atmosphere.\nThings you should know:\nI. PARKING \nAh, well. I'm not too much help with this category like I usually am. We used to live by Ponce so we know the free spots over there blind-folded. We walked from there to here. I believe there's some street parking you can take a gander at. I'll update this if I find out. \nII. SERVICE \nWow, so friendly and kind. Our waiter's communication was seamless with us. There was a hiccup with the kitchen but our waiter's apology went the extra mile. Give that man a raise. \nIII. QUALITY\nGourmet doughnuts for $2.50? Yesss. The flavor pairings with all the menu options (savory and sweet) were outstanding. Honestly, we loved everything we ordered. \nIV. CAPACITY \nIt's always safe to make a reservation on a Sunday. We booked ours at 11a.m. and there wasn't much of a crowd but 30 minutes in to our experience, things became busyyy.",

        "text": "We went for a week night dinner date with friends. Glad we made reservations because the place was packed. We sat in a cute little table booth in the corner and our server (Angel G) was top notch. We ordered drinks, a variety of apps and main dishes to share. Angel made sure the different items came out timely and not all together so we had time to enjoy them before the next round of plates were brought out. Overall, the food was excellent and the service was amazing. I would definitely go back. \n\nHere's the delicious details...in no particular order. \nThe Lobster roll was good but not the best part of the meal. I would still get it again but not if I had to give up something else to get it. \n\nGET THE FRY BREAD. I cannot emphasize this enough. It's been a month and I'm still thinking about it. It's savory; it's sweet. It's all the things and it's awesome. \n\nIf you're into oysters, get some. It was shocking how spot on the different write ups were. They are all a little different so try a couple. The vinegar and fresh cocktail sauce are amazing but you don't need them. Dress them or don't, that's up to you but the naked oyster are fabulous. \n\nThe Collar was a unique meaty dish. I've never had anything like it. The slaw is a nice addition to the plate and gives each bite a fresh pop of flavor and crunch. \n\nThe mussels were yummy!  They paired them well with a lovely acidic tomato base and the sour cucumbers - WOW!  \n\nThe salt and pepper squid was light and crispy. The flavor was great and jalapeño gives it a nice kick (but not overpowering). \n\nI was iffy on the Moqueca Stew when Angel recommended it but I'm so glad we got it. It's delicate and creamy but not too dense as some coconut/nut dishes can be. \n\nThe Poke was a fresh mix of ingredients. Nothing took over the bowl and everything mingled together nicely. It was a solid appetizer.",

ALL WERE AMAZING! LITERALLY FRESH AND MELT IN YOUR MOUTH. some of the best yeast donuts I've had. they're large and in charge! my favorite was the plain jane. to me, you cant go wrong with a simple glazed donut.\n\nadditionally, i had to get some savory options which were the cheeseburger and shrimp n grits. in general, I'm not a huge fan of shrimp and grits, but my friend who was really enjoyed them. the burger was a classic - nothing special, but solid. came with waffle fries with some cajun seasoning. \n\noverall, highly recommend as a brunch spot and loved walking to the beltline after eating all that yummy food!",

        "text": "I'd never been to Inman Park before but heard good things about this brunch spot and wanted to try it. Street parking is a little hard to find; we paid to park in a garage that was half a block from the restaurant. The area is super cute and I definitely want to explore more...but onto the review! The restaurant has such a fun and unique feel. I loved the upstairs, but the downstairs \"den\" area with a second bar is amazing. We were seated outside. Service was quick and very friendly. Be forwarded that \"donut brunch\" may start at 10 am on the weekends but apparently in GA they cannot serve you drinks until 11 am. We arrived around 10:50 am so the waitress just made us wait 10 mins for our cocktails. This restaurant is huge so getting a table was not a problem. \n\nOnto the drinks/food. I ordered a regular mimosa and it was strong and tasty. We split the unicorn donut, which is the one with cookie dough in the middle. It was so fresh and light and tasty. Super good. I got the coconut yogurt and a side of scrambled eggs for my main course. The yogurt was really yummy -- it had bananas and cacao nibs and coconut on top. But the amount of yogurt they gave me was kinda laughable. It was like a light smear of yogurt, almost like they forgot to put the rest in the bowl. Oh well, maybe this was just an error. I am glad I got the side eggs otherwise it would not have been enough. Eggs were wet and cooked perfectly. My bf got the pork hash which was a huge quantity and very delicious. \n\nAnyway, overall this is a very fun brunch spot with strong drinks, cute atmosphere and delicious food.",

        "text": "I wanted to try BeetleCat after a friend's recommendation. From the front counter with Hilary and Taylor, to the water server who had my actual server move the heater closer to me because I was chilly, to my actual server Tony, who recommended I add St Germaine's to my Prosecco and that I order that phenomenal fry bread, to the young woman who served my drink and entrees, and to the other staff who smiled at me on their way to help other patrons...thank youuuuu! Management should be very proud of the vibe the staff has created in this place! Service is such a huge part of the dining experience, and although it was a busy Friday night, y'all definitely nailed it! \n\nNow for the food...First, I ordered Oysters. The descriptions that are written on the oyster menu were spot on. I also ordered the Moqueca Stew, which is comprised of smoked fish, shrimp, coconut milk, jalapeños, topped with cilantro with a side of rice. Whew! I could have licked the bowl! (I actually used the fry bread to get as much as I could out of the bowl!) I definitely recommend this place. \n\nI sat outdoors on the patio, which was a little quiet. The main dining room and the downstairs bar and dining area were a bit more lively. The indoors and downstairs were packed so you will definitely need a reservation. Can't wait to try the lobster roll on my next visit!",

I've made eye contact with TWO servers & no one has come to help us. I don't want to assume it's because my group is a group of people of color but every other table here has been helped & we've yet to been approached. A friend recommended this place & I was excited to try it. Disappointed in the lack of service. My other friend had to go up to the bar to order & let them know we were still waiting to be served. \n\nGot a pitcher of the \"Fish House Brunch\" & I do NOT recommend it. Honestly I don't know what went wrong but I'm so disappointed for it being my first time here. It's a cute place but service is not good & our drinks were not tasty/good either.\n\nAsked for an espresso martini, server made a remark about it being \"difficult\" to make. I said okay what else would you suggest that's easier for you to make since it seems busy for you. He said it was okay & that he'll make it for me. He literally handed me an Irish coffee. NOT an espresso martini.",

The staff is friendly and helpful with selecting food.\n\nIf you're looking for a vibe-y space, request to sit downstairs. 70s theme with great ambiance while upstairs feels brighter and more upscale.

        "text": "I told you we'd be back for Valentine's Day. This was a 4 course pre fixe menu with a wine pairing. \n\nMaaaaaan... Chef Eddie set the bar super high with the Gulf Shrimp dish. I hope the sauce he puts on that dish finds its way into more dishes. It could literally go on anything and I can't wait for him to test that theory. Eddie does a wonderful job of letting the ingredients speak for themselves.  They taste what they are supposed to taste like but the flavors that are added perfectly accentuate the strengths of each main ingredient. \n\nIn addition to the food, BeetleCat is special because of the people. It's fine dining but the people give you the warmth of your favorite neighborhood spot. Doesn't matter how many times you've been there, you're an old friend and they're happy to see you. \n\nI recently watched a TED talked that talked about \"unreasonable hospitality\" where the experience and how people feel in a restaurant is just as important as the food. BeetleCat meets that standard for me. When we had to wait (less than 10 minutes) for our table, we were offered complimentary wine for our wait. We brought our 4 year old with us tonight and when she started crying, a member of the staff offered her a flower and some extra menus for our daughter to draw on. Eddie came to talk to us like we were old friends. \n\nBeetleCat is easily one of our favorite spots. The food is delicious and the people are wonderful. \n\nNever a disappointment. \n\n\nAlso, did I mention that the brown butter hot sauce is amazing?\n\nKudos on maintaining the quality on a busy and hectic night like Valentine's Day. \n\nOops, I almost forgot... the espresso martini with tequila at the end was the PERFECT nightcap. Shout out to the bar manager for the fantastic drink pairings.",

        "text": "This is my second time at BeetleCat and it was just as nice as the first time. I'll start with the food - TRY THE FRYBREAD! It is out of this world. It's drizzled with honey butter and nori seasoning (seaweed flakes and sesame). We ordered oysters off of the individual menu and the price ranges from $2.60-$3.60 but they change up the selection (I'm not sure how often). All of the oysters were fresh and delicious. My boyfriend is gluten free and our kind server Jarrell marked up a menu for him with the items that he could eat and modifications that would need to be made to make certain dishes gluten free. So nice! He went with the trout which is a filet of fish, skin on the bottom. It comes with fennel, apple and pickled mustard seed. I probably would have wanted a little bit more substance for the sides but that's just me. The flavor was there and he loved the dish. Our friend ordered the wedge salad, which he also said that he loved. The only bummer is that there aren't any protein adds for the sides. You can add shrimp for $20 but I realized you're just ordering the peel & eat shrimp off of the appetizer menu. We also ordered the lobster roll but I didn't take a picture of it because I forgot and honestly there's a million pictures on here of it haha I like the lobster roll, it's filled with meat and comes with fries but the $39 price point is a little steep imo. It comes with butter that isn't melted and I think I just prefer that style of lobster roll. It's also on a bun so it's not really a roll. \n\nAnyway, I specifically wanted to get a photo of the wedge because I didn't see one on here. I got the moqueca. It's my second time having it and it's good. Nothing that blows me out of the water but good enough to order it again. The star of the meal was the baked oysters. I would definitely recommend. Our friend who doesn't like oysters tried them and loved it. \n\nThe ambiance of the place is really nice. It's in the middle of inman park with a fun vibe. I will say the downstairs area has a more relaxed feel than the upstairs. There is a bar downstairs you can sit at but there's also tables. We ubered there because parking is kind of a pain. You can park in the Inman Quarter lot, but you have to pay. And parking on the street is scarce. Be mindful of signs because some streets seem like normal street parking but you need a permit.",

Now let me preface this by stating, we are not oyster people and that's the hot item here. We were here for the donuts and donut sandwich. We tried the cinnamon roll donut which was served hot and had a little crunch to it which was appreciated. The smash burger was a good size with descent flavor but was lacking the texture that smash burgers usually have. The captain's donut chicken sandwich was massive. Although all parts were executed well, it definitely needed a flavor element to cut through the sweetness from the donut and sauce on the chicken. All in all cool experience to check out the viral sandwich and donuts but I think it's an experience best reserved for those who prefer oysters.",

The brunch  menu is quite small and mostly donuts which are delicious in their own right but certainly not the brunch I was hoping for. However, I will say that the ambiance is great, staff is attentive and drinks are wonderful. I'd go back but more as a sweet treat after breakfast/brunch.

I probably ate here every other month and didn't have a single negative experience.\n\nTheir fish house punch is one of my favorite cocktails of all time, their burger is insane, their oyster selection is excellent, and their wings never disappoint. My only negative about BeetleCat is that their menu is rotating, so you might have to say goodbye to a favorite. That being said, whatever gets rotated in is also delicious, and will make you forget about the dish you lost.\n\nI moved from Atlanta over half a year ago, and whenever my girlfriend and I have a negative restaurant experience we both say \"remember BeetleCat?\" and think about how much better our meal would've been there.

Street parking is the move as usual in the area, and we were lucky to get a table even without a reservation (it really filled up right after we sat down a bit before 12:30). \n\nThe group ordered quite a few donuts, and I had the donkey Kong and peaches and cream ones. I absolutely love banana pudding so the donkey Kong was my favorite. \n\nI had a crispy chicken thigh sandwich for my entree and omg this makes the hall of fame for atl fried chicken! It was soooo crispy, well seasoned, and the sauce and buns were perfect too! The fries were also seasoned well and overall, it was the perfect brunch!\n\nBeetlecat's brunch was so good and I can't wait to come back and try their oysters and their seafood dinner.",

Lee celebrated a friend who just eloped and our server was so kind, fun, and knowledgeable of the menu. He offered us suggestions for gluten free options, or how many items could be gluten free. \n\nNow for the food - everything was delicious!! I got the moqueca stew and it was incredible. It reminded me of a Thai curry with the coconut and cashew flavors, but with fish and shrimp. One friend got the coconut fried rice, another got the mussels, and another got the burger (forgot a photo). All raving reviews!\n\nWe also shared a round of oysters and oyster back shots. We're planning to go back soon for their oyster happy hour! I got the salty dog cocktail which was amazing as well. 10/10 meal and experience - can't wait to go back!",
