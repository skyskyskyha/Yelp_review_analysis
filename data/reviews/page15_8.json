        "text": "I went to Cafe Sunflower Buckhead on 7/20 for my sister's birthday. We were seated fairly quickly because we made reservations. I've been before and was excited to go again. We were going to order some cocktails but they only have beer and wine as an option for alcoholic beverages. Also, with it being 5 people at the table, the waitress was very friendly and answered all of our questions. \n\nI think Cafe Sunflower Buckhead is a great restaurant but for the food items they serve, I think it is over priced. We had four shared appetizers (spinach and artichoke dip, spring rolls, Buffalo lollipops, and the avocado tacos. I ordered the sesame chicken soy and it was $19.00. The portion was average but because of all the appetizers that were ordered, I took some of my entree to go. It did not warm up well and I was very disappointed! \n\nI really enjoy going to cafe sunflower but those prices! There's no reason why spaghetti bolognese (didn't order) should be almost $30.00 or even a plant based burger for $18.00.",

I would've loved to have some sour cream and a little salt. But it was very fresh and I'd get it again for sure! \nFor the main course, I ordered the bolognese which was also pretty yummy. For dessert, I got the chocolate peanut butter mousse cake which was AMAZING!!! My husband recently became vegan and I'll definitely take him. I know he'd love it.

It's either you make 2 or 4. We had to share the last one, but imagine if I wasn't in the mood to share.

        "text": "This is my friends' favorite vegan joint, and I can definitely see why! They have a fairly wide variety of foods with plenty of options for all sorts of picky eaters (gluten free for me). \n\nI got their \"burrito,\" which were more like tacos as gluten free (corn tortillas on the side). I absolutely loved the dish--who can say no to avocado, well seasoned mushroom-quinoa, and steamed spinach? The sweet potato mash was good too, but it weirded me out going in a burrito/taco (I'm from LA)...it's good on it's own though. Chipotle aioli was also delicious! Their corn tortillas were surprisingly very good--full corn flavor, which I surprisingly usually don't get a lot of from other places that serve corn tortillas.\n\nPad thai: I loved the texture of their noodles! Just the right amount of chewy, but still soft enough to bite through--this is definitely a good dish to get. I won't say that this is \"pad thai\" as much as they're \"asian-style noodles covered with peanut -based sauce,\" (once again, I'm from LA) but it was VERY delicious and filling. I'd say this was my favorite dish of everything we ordered.\n\nSpinach artichoke dip: The corn tortillas I raved about before, but in chips form and dunked in a delicious \"I can't believe it's vegan\" creamy sauce! This is a wonderful gluten free appetizer for everyone to share!\n\nMy friends also got the chicken lollis, which weren't gluten free, but they get it every single time. I'll assume that this is some amazing stuff, so I'd encourage y'all to try it if you can eat gluten.\n\nOverall, this is a very solid vegan restaurant, and I would love to come again to check out their desserts and other entrees. If you live in the area and love your veggies, you will definitely love this place as well!",

It was my vegetarian coworker's birthday, so we decided to trek it out for a great meal for her. Little did I know the transformation here would be so tremendous. \n\nThe restaurant is sunlit, chic and modern, a far cry from the dim and murky hippie vibe of the previous location. Our server was friendly and sincere as he took our orders. I had the Pad Thai - which was delicious - and a cup of Butternut Squash soup, whiit was pretty good but nothing mind blowing. The Pad Thai was very filling with the noodles and tofu, but smelled very strongly of something fried or super nutty, not sure what exactly it was. It was tasty but after a while, the strong flavors definitely got a hold of me. I took about 40% of it to go. \n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised. I've got to come back and try some of the other items on the menu that I had been trying to decide between.",

        "text": "This was my first visit to a vegan restaurant. I was pessimistic, but it turned out good. The GPS did have a hard a hard time finding it. The atmosphere is casual. The staff were friendly. The menu was varied and not my normal choices. I decided to stay in my comfort zone. \nThe springs rolls were small but tasty. I had the pad Thai for the entree. The noodles were large and flat, lots of mushrooms, zucchini and green beans. The sauce was good and rich. I did not like the tofu (it's a texture thing). But the pieces were large enough to remove. Everyone else's food looked good, but not my thing. Desert was delicious. \nI have to say I was pleasantly surprised, but I did play it safe. My system was a little off later that night and the next morning. So first timers be aware.",

I was definitely impressed with the ambiance of the restaurant it was nicely decorated with low lighting to give a nice upscale dining feel. I ordered the spring rolls for an appetizer they were okay & definitely not the best I have had. For the main course I had the sesame soy chicken & my bf had the pad thai. Overall we both enjoyed our dishes & would return. Hopefully on the next visit service will be better after the host seated us it took our server about 10 minutes to come over & greet us/take our drink orders. The food also took a very long time to come to our table.",

The restaurant serves Sunday brunch until 2p. We arrived at 1:20p. The hostess informed us that as a precaution due to the line and the kitchen closing at 1:50, there was a possibly we may not get a chance to dine in.  Luckily, we waited and 10 minutes later were seated.  Due to kitchen closing soon promptly after being seated we ordered.  I had the loaded breakfast with a mimosa, and my husband had the avocado toast.  We both enjoyed our meals , and even as \"baby vegans,\" we didn't miss meat one bit.  I definitely recommend this place to vegans and carnivores as the meals are flavorful and well prepared.\n\nS/N:  the restaurant recently transitioned to 100% vegan this year.  I guess perhaps they once has non vegan options.",

Please try the Buffalo Lollipops they taste JUST like the real thing sometimes I even think they're better than the real thing. Don't skip\nout on the \"blue cheese\" sauce as well it pair perfectly with the buffalo pops. The shrimp tacos are great here I was so shocked at how similar of a texture to shrimp they had. If you are not into meat alternatives they also have a great list of options like the Orzo Eggplant Lasagna. Don't be turned off by this vegan place it's just as great as any other meat serving establishment!",

        "text": "I'm now thinking about becoming a vegetarian after my visit to Cafe Sunflower. Everything is vegetarian and many of the menu items are vegan. This is the first vegetarian restaurant in Atlanta that I have dined at that truly makes you question why you even bother eating meat of any kind.\n\nThe customer service was great. We were seated fairly quickly. The ambiance was chic with dim lighting perfect for a date or a night out with friends. Our waitress gave my skeptical meat eating dining partners great suggestions which had them huge fans of not only Cafe Sunflower but also vegatarian food by the time we were done. \n\nEverything we tried was very flavorful. We had the crispy Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer, they had a sweet tangy glaze over top of fried Brussel Sprouts and were delicious. The portions were all a good size. I ordered the Sesame Chicken which was to die for. Every bite of my dish tasted like a party was happening right inside my mouth. All of the flavors went together perfectly and the soy chicken was firm it had my dinner partners questioning if it was actually really soy. Someone else at my table had the Eggplant  Lasagna and said it was very good. I tried the Lasagna and the asparagus which was placed on top was cooked perfectly. The rest of the dish had an abundance of flavors that did not do much for me but the person who ordered the dish said he loved it. Cafe Sunflower was a pleasant surprise.",

The shrimp tacos and spinach artichoke dip were lacking in seasoning. These menu items sounded so inviting but they just didn't taste like much. ‍ I don't know...maybe I eat too much ethnic food. I spent over $40, trying to support a vegan business and patron a popular Atlanta restaurant. Ugh!  Between the high prices and bland food, this type of place gives vegan food a bad name (in my opinion). If you're in the Gwinnett area, check out Shawnee's Goodies in Lilburn; affordable and flavorful. I wish I had of taken a photo of the food. It looked great; which was seriously deceiving. Oh and 2 fried vegan shrimp in a taco; 2 tacos for $15+!  Ps. I'm not trying to attack them. I'm being honest just as I am in my previous review. I wish someone had written something similar to this so I could have saved my money. Good luck everyone! #govegan #stayvegan",

Recommend everything we ordered: avocado tacos appetizer, buffalo wings appetizer, eggplant lasagne main, sesame soy chicken main and red velvet cake dessert (may have over ordered as we were SO full leaving but #noregrets). Overall so glad we came and can't recommend highly enough!",

My vegan friend picked this place out specifically sighting its great food so I could not wait to give it a try. \n\nUpon arrival we were pleasantly surprised with a menu that made everybody in the group (even the non veg) happy. They offer entrees with veggie but not vegan options. So if you aren't ready to take the plunge there is still plenty there for you! \n\nWe had a group of 6, and unfortunately I have to say the service was lacking. We were on a lunch break to celebrate a birthday and even asking for the check with the food didn't get us in and out within an 1 1/2 hours. Yikes! Luckily we were cut a break by the business for the birthday and had a minute to enjoy the DELICIOUS chocolate vegan cake for dessert. \n\nI'd love to come back but I would really have to find some other time where the service is less of a problem. \n\nA-OK!",

Very nice welcoming clean setting waiting area. We were seated shortly and luckily our hostess seated us in a booth being we had baggage. Good lookin out! Most of the seating was chairs and tables. Server was very polite and on top of it. I wanted everything on the menu. We decided on Tofu Benedict and Blueberry Pancakes. The Hollandaise sauce made the entree hearty. Super tasty. Shared blueberry pancakes and I have to say this was the best vegan pancakes I have had yet. Great job! Didn't get soggy but had a light crisp which was delightful. Bathroom was very clean easily accessible. If I ever travel to ATL again I will most definitely eat here again. Thank you Cafe Sunflower. The quality speaks through the food. Awesome place.",

We also got the mushroom scallops.  They are great too.\n\nEntrees were the home made ravioli and then the chimichuri steak on mashed potatoes with grilled asparagus.  \n\nMy only regret is that this restaurant is 100 miles from home.  But I intend on coming again when in Atlanta.  The main problem I see, is wanting to order the things I already know are awesome... and wanting to try new things.",

        "text": "This was difficult to rate as we came to Cafe Sunflower years ago and had a wonderful experience so we were so excited to come back to Atlanta and have dinner at Cafe Sunflower. \n\nWe had reservations but got there early and they happily seated us. Our server, who was very pleasant, got our drink order (I ordered a flavored tea and my husband a glass of wine). As an appetizer we ordered Spring Rolls, which were pretty tasteless to our surprise. \n\nOur server gave us some time to enjoy our drinks before we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Cauliflower Steak and my husband the veggie loaf. My Cauliflower was just okay. Outside of the first bite, that was heavily salted, it was pretty tasteless as well. My side of veggies were good, but underwhelming to be honest. \n\nMy husbands loaf, I thought was good, but he felt it was missing seasoning. I did take a bite of his mashed potatoes with I love and we both agreed that we did not care for them. There was a huge after-taste of Almond Milk, which was not pleasant. \n\nTo top our night off, and because we were disappointed in our meals, we decided to have the Peanut Butter Pie, which was delicious. It was worth the extra calories. \n\nOverall take on our evening. The Cauliflower was not worth the price nor was the loaf. The only item worth the price was the dessert, certainly not the +$100 we spent for our evening. \n\nUnfortunately, this particular evening ruined our Cafe Sunflower experience. My husband rated the experience a 2 star but I couldn't do that to my vegan friends so it was just okay.",

The boyfriend had a risotto that was smooth and buttery -- without butter. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the chocolate cake. That was some of the best chocolate cake I've ever had in my life. Is it entirely vegan? \n\nCafe Sunflower gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the waiter could have refilled our water glasses more often, and the prices could be a little bit cheaper for the fact that no meat is used.",

I tried a few places during my stay in Atlanta and this made my new favorite.  I was so happy to have come for dinner after not having had a meal all day! I ordered the special, sunflower bolognese, my husband the Sesame soy chicken and we ordered the fried avocado tacos as an appetizer.

        "text": "Café Sunflower in Buckhead is located at Brookwood Square next to Houston's Restaurant.  I am not a vegan/vegetarian but I thoroughly enjoyed Café Sunflower.  A good friend of mine visited a group of friends to join her at Café Sunflower since she heard rave reviews.  \n \nOur waiter was super nice and very knowledgeable of the menu.  He was able to point out some great food options.  I ordered the spring rolls that consisted of Asian cabbage, carrots, onions, mushrooms, and glass noodles, with a side of sweet and sour sauce. Which was delicious.  I also ordered the Buffalo Lollipops; the homemade buffalo hot sauce was really good, the meat taste kind of taste like ribs.  Overall pretty good, and the closest thing to tasting like real hot wings.\n\nOne friend ordered the Spicy Pad Thai Noodles and said it was really good and flavorful.  I did try it and will probably order it during my next visit.  Another friend of mine had the Sesame Soy Chicken (without the soy chicken), he really enjoy and thought it was a good choice for his first vegan meal.  And the friend that invited us also had the Buffalo Lollipop and the Pan Seared Mushroom Scallops and said it was cooked to perfection.  Everything is moderately price and will not break the bank if you decide to go on a random night. \n\nOverall, we had a great experience with the staff and food service.  We will be back soon.",

We ordered the Buffalo lollipops, crispy shrimp tacos, sesame soy chicken and the old fashioned chocolate cake - everything was fantastic. It was my friend's first time eating vegan food and he said it tastes better than real meat so there's that. Also, props to our server TAYLOR, she went above and beyond for us. Great service, yummy food and clean place. LOVED IT!!!",

The seitan chicken was very crispy and authentic to tasting like real chicken. \nOverall me and my husband had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back in the future!",

        "text": "Parking: The lot is somewhat confusing to get into because it looks like you are pulling into the Houston's parking lot, but there is an opening once you turn in so you can park in the plaza where Cafe Sunflower is. \n\nAmbience: My friend and I sat outside for dinner in 70 degree weather and it was perfect. \n\nFood (see photos): We ended up ordering the Ginger Spice juice and the Iced Wild Berry Tea- both were wonderful. The Ginger Spice did not have an overbearing ginger taste and the Wild Berry Tea was extremely refreshing. As far as appetizers, we got the Buffalo Lollipops and the Crispy Brussel Sprouts. The Brussel Sprouts were lightly fried and coated in some sort of sweet sauce that was a perfect addition- definitely one of my favorite things on the menu. The Buffalo Lollipops were not my favorite as the texture of them threw me off. They were extremely chewy. As for our entrees, my friend had the special which was the Vegan Crispy Shrimp Tacos and I had the GF Fettucine Alfredo. Both were great and the Alfredo tasted just as good heated up for lunch the next morning. To finish off, we had a slice of the Raspberry Chocolate Cake (super scrumptious and refreshing) paired with a Chai Tea Latte (on the spicier side and GREAT) and a Peppermint Latte (it was okay). \n\nWe overheard the woman at the table behind us talking about the other location in Sandy Springs and how that one is a little different than the Buckhead location. Seeing as how we had a solid time and the food was pretty good, I would want to try out the other location as well.",

        "text": "Living in the south it's almost impossible to find a good vegetarian restaurant. Well that was the case until last week when my friend too me to this place. And glad I am that she did.\n\nBy far the best vegetarian restaurant I've been to atlanta. And one would have a preconceived notion that it'll be hippy/bohemian style but to my surprise it was the opposite. Not table cloth fancy but still pretty nice.\n\nThe servers were very friendly and attentive.\n\nThe menu; so many options that you just can't decide. But needless to say, what ever you order it'll be very good.\n\nAs for food, we ordered the Grilled eggplant caprese stack. The eggplant was properly cooked without any soggy feeling and the crispness of the tomatoes worked perfectly well with the eggplant. The best thing about this dish was the cashew cream. It added a hint of sweetness that worked great with the balsamic vinegar.\n\nNext we ordered the roasted portobello mushroom melt. And I'm not over selling it here but you couldn't tell that there wasn't any meat in it. It was just awesome.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place for the vegetarian lovers and for the meat lovers looking to be fooled by vegetables acting and tasting like meat.",

        "text": "lovely experience for dinner on a weeknight. I knew I wanted a vegetarian friendly meal so Yelp helped me with the search. Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated in the middle of the dining room. It was neat to see the restaurant has smaller rooms that are created for small group dining. \n\nFor dinner I ordered the burger with fries. The server convinced me that their fresh juices are made to order and delicious. So I asked her if I could get it with alcohol and she responded, of course with champagne. Sold on the drink, I opted for Cucumber Fizz. The drink came out minutes later and it was refreshing. The serving size for the drink with the champagne was unusually large, no complaints. The burger was delicious and filling. The fries were fresh and spot on as well. There was also a salad on the plate, an added healthy bonus. \n\nPortions here are large so be prepared to take some home or share with someone, or bring a big appetite. \n\nIt's not often you expect to enjoy a vegetarian restaurant that knocks it out of the park but Sunflower knows its vegetarian game. I am coming back for the fresh juices with sparkling wine. \n\nParking is easy to find in the lot the restaurant sits in. Don't make the mistake I did and drive past. There are clear signs for cars being towed if you are parked in the incorrect lot.",

        "text": "For a GNO, a friend recommended us this vegetarian friendly place. All of us are not vegetarians, but we wanted to try something different. We didn't make reservations so the host mentioned that the wait was about 30 minutes, but they were able to get us in, in no time.\n\nThe girls and I ordered:\n-Crispy Brussels Sprouts - it was AMAZING. Not sure if its as healthy since it is fried in tempura batter, but these were good!\n\n-Fried Avocado Tacos -The order comes with 3 tacos, so we were able to share it between the three of us. But it was soooooo good that we had to order another one. One of my friend do not eat cheese, but when she had this taco, she didn't even realized there were cheese in it! This dish is a MUST try!\n\n-Sunflower Burger (We wanted to try the Impossible Burger, since one of my friend was raving about it, but they were out. So the server suggested the sunflower burger & it was okay... it was really dry and we did not like it)\n\n- Fettuccini Alfredo - to be honest, we didn't get to try this at all. We were sitting there talking, and the server just assumed we were done and brought out a to go box before we got to try it. Mind you, we didn't ask for a to go box yet. But it no hard feelings, we were so full from eating the others, so we ended up putting it in the to go box. \n\nFor dessert, we got the Raspberry Chocolate Mousse Cake to share and boy, it was DELICIOUS! I had to order another one to go so my Fiance can try it! Try this, you wont be disappointed. \n\nOverall the experience was good. If I was to come back, it would probably be for the Tacos and the Raspberry Chocolate Mouse Cake",
