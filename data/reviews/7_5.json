The spicy miso is very yummy as well as the yasai. Portion size, the proportion of veggies and meat toppings to broth and noods are all wonderful. Been there 3 times in a week... need I say more?

        "text": "One of the more cleaner Japanese ramen broths I've had. I'm not a huge fan of Japanese ramen because I think they're too heavy and oily but the ramen broth here is made of chicken so much cleaner and leaner. \n\nMy husband and I ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts, takoyaki, tori Paitan, and the ultra spicy tori paitan (level 5). Our waiter was a gem for recommending these dishes. First off the takoyaki is a must. One of the better ones I've tried. The brussel sprouts were delicious but nothing out of the ordinary. If you like spicy, the ultra spicy level 5 isn't too spicy. They do have their homemade spicy sauce you can ask for and add to the side as well if you want a bit more kick. Overall, good ramen and service!",

        "text": "Recently visited Kinnotori for a date night and was pleasantly surprised at how cozy the place and how yummy the food! \n\nTucked in the busy midtown plaza across the street from Ponce City Market. Kinnotori shares parking with Home Depot, TJ Maxx, Whole Foods,etc and nestle Ed right next to Tacos & Tequila. Parking was free and easy but it could potentially be congested during peak hours.\n\nLate on a rainy Sunday night, we were seated quickly; however the place is on the smaller side so this may not be the case on a normal day. Tables are socially distanced. Servers kept their distance and wore masks. They also have the Menu setup as a QR code on the table that you're able to access on your phone. Really appreciate the steps taken during this pandemic for those of us wanting to give our business and willing to sit inside!\n\nOn to the food! The pork steamed buns were very delicious and some of the best I've had in the city. Plus 2 for $5!? Can't go wrong with that deal in my book. Honestly I could come back just for those. I also enjoyed their spicy miso ramen with grilled chicken. They give you an option for either grilled or fried chicken with your ramen. The ramen wasn't much spicy but very flavorful. I throughly enjoyed it and thought the portion for the price was spot on. \n\nOverall I had a great experience and will be back to this convenient little ramen spot!",

I put some of the brussels sprouts in my Ramen, it was outstanding. Least favorite thing was the truffle fries, which were fairly boring and pedestrian. There was only one server working the lunch shift. He did his best to be helpful and accommodating but was a little bit overwhelmed and distracted. Overall very good experience.

When we went to order drinks, we found out that they do not have a liquor license so they can't serve you beer, etc. that was very disappointing.\n\nWe went ahead and ordered our ramen anyways since we were hungry. I ordered the ramen with fried chicken and it was perfect. I enjoyed all of it.\n\nThey do not have the normal pork broth ramen which is also disappointing.\n\nIf you don't need a beer with your ramen or pork options, go ahead and give it a try.",

        "text": "Atmosphere/service: plenty of parking in the plaza, don't think you can park here, eat and cross the city to Ponce though, they will definitely tow or boot your car. The space inside the restaurant is pretty small with limited seating which is why they ask for your full party to be present before they seat you. Service was great!\n \nFood/price: so the interesting thing about this place in my opinion is that they do chicken broth vs pork/bone broth as their signatures. They also have a seafood or vegetarian broth option as well and you can tailor the spicy level (L1-5 are their options). Their menu is easy and not overly complicated, just one page including appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Cocktail menus are separate. My husband and I shared\n-          Fried squid legs ($10): seasoned fried squid legs with spicy mayo. Thought the portion size was a bit small but it was really good and seasoned well. Would get again.\n-          Ultra spicy tori paitan ramen ($13): original tori broth, comes topped with Sapporo style bean sprout and onion, seaweed, green onion, and habanero. Choice of fried or grilled chicken (extra $3) - we opted to sub for charsu for $3. The charsu was not what we were expecting, it was essentially just three small slices of pork belly that were pan fried versus the circular rolled pork belly charsu that I know from other ramen establishments. I would say the pork is not worth it. The broth was good, we got the L3 spice and it had a kick to it from the fresh habanero.\n-          Seafood ramen ($18): original seafood broth infused with tori paitan. Comes with squid, bay scallops, torched onion, bean sprout, fresh seaweed and green onion. Choice of whole shrimp with head on or battered fried shrimp. You get 3 shrimp - we got the whole shrimp with head on. Good bits of seafood in there, broth was good and noodles were chewy.",

        "text": "Yum! I'm finding that Atlanta has plenty of solid ramen options, with KinNoTori being one of them!\n\nCame here for a quick dinner on Saturday (around 6:30 pm) and the place was quite packed. It's a very intimate setting, so don't expect to come here with a large group and get seated right away. I managed to get a seat at the bar area facing the kitchen. \n\nI wouldn't describe the vibe as authentic Japanese, but it's more of a trendy/modernized feel - lofi music blasting over the speakers, Sanrio decorations/figurines, and the place can get quite loud just given how dense it gets in the modest-sized space. \n\nFor drinks, they don't have hard liquor, but they do offer a few sake and beer options. Since there was no Sapporo or Asahi, I chose the Ukiyo premium lager (brewed in Georgia, lol..) which was really smooth and had a nice finish. For food, I chose the spicy miso ramen with fried chicken (per my waitress' recommendation) and it was really tasty! Broth was the perfect level of spice, egg was cooked exactly how it should be, chicken was nice and crispy (before eventually getting soaked in the broth of course). Portion sizes are quite small here, especially given the relatively steep prices. \n\nService was pretty average during my experience - for some reason I expected above-and-beyond hospitality based on all the previous reviews, but didn't get that. Maybe just an off night?\n\nDefinitely want to keep exploring other ramen options in ATL, but I would come back here again!",

This place is a little different than other ramen places in that, as far as I remember, the protein here is mostly chicken instead of the traditional pork chashu. The ramen was still excellently prepared.\n\nI value a great soft boiled egg at ramen places, and the preparation of mine was one of the top 5 soft boiled eggs I've had. Their baos are good too, and I like the hybrid of a bao with karaage. Crispy and delicious. \n\nThe service here is great as well. The servers are always making sure the food is okay, making sure your drinks are full. \n\nWill definitely come back here.",

My husband had one of their seafood ramens which he said had generous portions of seafood and he said broth was good not too salty.  They don't have a wheat noodle without eggs which was a little disappointing as a vegan.  They also didn't have a kids option on the menu like other ramen spots we have tried around Atlanta.  The service was okay.  It wasn't warm or inviting but more cordial than anything.  Food came out a bit slow and our ramen came before our appetizer.  While they did have vegan options, the options were a little underwhelming.  I got the Yasai with kale noodles and the broth was so salty it wasn't edible.  The server let me replace it with the veggie teriyaki don which was much better, and I felt happier with that selection.  The shiitake bao was not bad but again a bit salty.  It was edible un like the ramen.  We asked for chili oil that we never got with our meal which was a bummer.  Overall it was an okay experience.  We might go back again at some point for a date night but I don't think it's the best spot to go as a family.",

They require all customers to wear masks and social distance.\nWe waited maybe 10min for a table, because we preferred a table over sitting at the bar. The staff cleaned and disinfected the table before seating us. \nWe got waters and ordered the Gyoza as an appetizer. They offer it steamed or fried. Currently the restaurant does not have their liquor license, so they only offer soft drinks and teas. While waiting for the appetizer, we ordered the Honey Miso Tori Paitan, Tori Paitan, and the Yasai Spicy Ramen. Everything was delicious!\nThe waitress was also very pleasant and hospitable.",

Our service was very quick and helpful and we both actually commented several times that this is the first time in a long time we have been somewhere with enough staff to actually keep things running smoothly and to engage with customers. Everyone was so nice constantly walking around checking on tables.\n\nMy husband and I almost never order the same thing but both ended up getting the Tori Paitan with pork, and shared the crispy brussel sprouts as an appetizer. The sprouts were huge so there weren't a lot but they were delicious. The ramen was perfect! Lots of perfectly chewy noodles and an impeccable soft boiled egg. The pork was fattier than I would have liked, so I'd probably just get it without meat next time but minor detail.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try more, there is so much on the menu that piqued my interest.",

Also I had the sweet yuzu hot tea and it was very delicious! \nI ordered the spicy paitan ramen and it comes with fried karaage chicken pieces, ramen egg and very spicy chicken broth. The noodles were perfectly al dente and the curly thick kind that goes perfectly well with the broth! Be aware that the spicy ramen is VERY spicy! I love spicy foods so I was able to tolerate it but definitely wanted to cry at the end of my meal. Overall I loved my ramen. My boyfriend had the classic paitan ramen which also had the fried chicken pieces but he was able to customize with roasted corn and he loved the smoky flavors of the corn with the ramen. \nStaff were very friendly, the place was clean and although there aren't many tables we were seated immediately. I don't have anything bad to say about this place! \nIf you love ramen and you love fried chicken, definitely give this place a try! I really enjoyed my experience here and can't wait to come back.",

We always get the takeaway, so we haven't really been beyond the front hostess stand. The packaging for the takeaway containers is great and mess-free. We are looking forward to eating in the restaurant soon. The tokoyaki was just okay (by the time we got it home, it wasn't as hot). I know that when you eat it fresh out the kitchen, it must be delicious. If you love spicy ramen (and being able to control the spice level), or you're looking for excellent seafood ramen (shrimp, scallops, and more), look no further than this ramen bar!!",

We decided to step out of the house for food and decided on Kinnotori because we wanted something cozy to eat and the reviews here were nearly perfect.\n\nI can now say that's for good reason! We got the shrimp and pork buns - there are 2 mini buns in each order. We also got a side/app of Brussels. All of the apps were delicious! Loved the shrimp bun, and the Brussels sprouts were very well prepared and season, not soggy at all!\n\nFor entrees we got the spicy miso and the ultra spicy miso ramen bowls with fried chicken. My friend got the level 3 spice in his ultra spicy miso and thankfully he didn't go higher--he actually sweated and it def cleared his sinus pathways. The 3 is def spicy enough for spice-lovers, any higher and you might hurt yourself! \n\nMy spicy miso was pretty standard and very tasty--the servings are good/generous, I actually didn't finish mine and had to take it to go. \n\nThe last things I want to add is that the service was very fast and friendly, and the Sweet Plum Tea is a MUST. It's so shockingly delicious and pleasant--I'm completely obsessed. Can't wait to return for the fried squid legs!",

However, they're open for take out and now dine-in. I went for lunch today and got the Honey Miso Tori ramen. It was good, and came with an egg (it was gooey in the middle and really satisfying), green onions, kale, and grilled chicken. And of course noodles.\n\nInstead of pork, they use chicken in all their ramen. You can also add quite a few thing in for a little extra. I was full afterwards and the ramen really hit the spot. The broth was good and overall it was a nice experience. They have a lot of different teas to try on the menu as well.\n\nThe service was excellent, and I was happy to support this business - especially with coronavirus going on, and restaurants and their employees really needing the help right now. I enjoyed the atmosphere and music and will be back soon! Thank you!",

        "text": "My partner and I have been here for a while and visited most of Atlanta's ramen joints. We were craving ramen again today, and came across KinNoTori Ramen Bar online. The menu looked amazing and due to its high review, we faced the city's crazy traffic for a while to get to KinNoTori.\n\nAlthough there are plenty of parking spaces outside, it took us a bit of time to find a parking spot but hey, I'm not complaining since it was free! The interior of KinNoTori is super cute and cozy, and the staff are friendly. We ordered Pork Buns, Takoyaki, Spicy Miso Tori, and the Ultra Spicy Tori Paitan (heat level 5 because I LOVE spicy food). The Takoyaki was chewy and savory. I preferred it over the Pork Buns, which was a bit too dry for me, but my partner enjoyed it. The portions for the ramen were decent. The Spicy Miso Tori had a mildly spicy chicken broth and was topped with a soft seasoned egg, onion, bean sprouts, green onions, burdock root, pickled red ginger, and fried chicken. Although it was flavorful - including the noodles - we're not used to ramen having a chicken broth. Same thing with the Ultra Spicy Tori Paitan. Although I chose the highest heat level, the ramen wasn't too spicy and it was still tasty.",

        "text": "Located in the massive Midtown Place shopping center across from Ponce City Market, Kin No Tori is a tiny spot tucked in an outbuilding. If you can't find it, look for the large Tacos & Tequilas signs; their entrance is right next door.\n\nThough the space is small, they've done a lot with it. There's a ramen bar, a number of two-tops and at least one large group booth. This is definitely not the spot for large groups dining in, unless you're OK sitting separately. The vibe is upscale casual, with cool smoked glass light fixtures and reclaimed wood (looking, at least) floors. The hallway to the bathroom is papered in fun posters. There wasn't any music playing, so it was a quiet place to eat while checking my emails. \n\nI popped in for lunch while running errands in the Midtown Place shopping center - seriously, there are so many stores all in one place! It was quiet, with only two other solo diners having lunch. The staff greeted me and seated me immediately, and my friendly server was all over it, grabbing me a water by the time I'd even settled in. \n\nThe menu's digital, with stickers affixed to the tables and the ramen bar you can scan with your phone. Not entirely sure what to order, I went with my gut and got both an app and a ramen bowl. Portions were surprisingly big, and came out nearly immediately. (Not sure if they're really just that efficient or it was a factor of no one else being in there are the same time, but either way I appreciated it. \n\nThe Kakuni ($6; braised pork belly appetizer) was just that - a bowl of nicely bite-sized chunks of tender pork belly in a sweet-and-salty soy-based sauce. \n\nThe Honey Miso Tori Paitan ($12-$14; chicken broth, beans sprouts, green onions, kale, sweet corn, a seasoned egg, and choice of fried or grilled chicken) was a little underwhelming. I was expecting a milkier, richer broth but I did like the chicken (tori) broth as it was a bit lighter at lunchtime, and unlike those heavy, salty broths, it didn't make me feel full and bloated afterwards. I was really tempted to try the fried chicken bun app and so I supplemented my ramen with fried chicken. I'll probably go a different route next time and get something with seafood in it - and those fried chicken buns.",

        "text": "I love Ramen and I'm a huuuge Ramen connoisseur so I was very excited when I seen a new Ramen spot open up near Ponce City Market.\n\nI must say, the Ramen was very flavorful. It was really good. I got the Spicy Miso which is a pretty standard Ramen dish, however the spice level was pretty low for my liking. It more so mild if you ask me. I feel like I should've ordered the Ultra Spicy Tori Paitan.\n\nMy overall experience was a pleasant one and will definitely be going back again. One thing I enjoyed about the menu at Kinnotori Ramen Bar is that they have a variety of both veggie and chicken broth options. Where as to traditional Ramen restaurants they normally use pork broth for a lot of their Ramen options.\n\nAnother thing to note is this restaurant is extremely small, so I would not recommend going in large groups.",

        "text": "So let's start with the good. The restaurant is very clean. The inside is small, but has enough seating and there is bar seating as well. Service is very prompt and friendly. The interior is also decorated with anime paraphernalia. Now the food, so went with the Chicken Gyoza, Tori Paitan, and Honey Miso Tori Paitan. \n\nChicken Gyoza: tasted pretty standard. There could have been a little more meat in the gyoza since there was an unbalanced wrapper to filling ratio. \n\nHoney Miso Tori Paitan: this dish was okay. The chicken broth bases soup is very light and lacked enough flavor to give the dish a flavor profile. Because the soup did not have a strong flavor to serve as the base of the ramen, everything else just seemed out of place without a unifying element.\n\nTori Paitan: the soup for this dish had a little more flavor, but the ingredients just didn't go with the dish. The fried onion seemed out of place, as well as the tomato. The noodles are also pretty bland and don't really add a dimension to the dish. I personally prefer more alkaline noodles so maybe this is just my bias.\n\nOverall, the restaurant itself is really quaint and clean. Service is good. Not really somewhere I would recommend to others for ramen or would go back to on my own though.",

Pro tip: if you do get the fried chicken, ask them to put it in the side for you so it stays crispy!  The staff is super helpful and friendly so I always make sure to tip generously.

We were quickly seated in an adorable warm booth and served very quickly with water. We ordered Takoyaki, an original Tori Paitan and their Seafood Ramen. We both really liked our bowls. They were so filling, we couldn't even finish! Personally, I loved the egg in mine. It was delicious! The noodles were also perfect and chewy. Since the broth was chicken (Tori) it was creamy and pleasurable. For me the pork broth can be too heavy and sometimes makes my stomach hurt. They have a variety of broth options for those with dietary restrictions. For those who do not eat pork or have other restrictions such as vegetarian, pescatarian or vegan this is your ramen spot! Give them a try, it would be sad to loose such a hidden gem!",

Every time I stop by this place I'm greeted in a short amount of time - no more than 2 minutes - and the owner is super kind. He's a busy bee, but usually gives a nice, quick hello or offers his assistance when I'm inside. \nThere's a point program that's free to sign up for too! I got $5 off after about 3 orders I think. \n\nThe spicy miso is my favoriteee! Jam-packed with flavor and not actually that spicy in my opinion  (take that with a grain of salt lol - I really enjoy spicy food so my tastebuds are probably fried ). I like to get my ramen without the egg, but it's just as tasty with the friend chicken as it is the grilled. Still prefer it with the friend chicken though lol. \n\nOrders come up pretty fast! I can't remember waiting more than 10 minutes, if that, since I usually come here solo. Best spicy ramen I've tried in the city so far, and I've lived here just under 6 months. Portions are not huge or small enough to disappoint - Perfect portions + definitely worth the price! \n\nIf there's another location opening up, I really hope the ambiance is set up for a nice dinnertime - the ambiance here gives me lunchtime vibes.",

        "text": "It's in the shopping plaza right across the street from Ponce City Market. The inside of the restaurant is a bit small but I love the cozy feeling of the place! Their ramen menu is a bit confusing at first... but once they explained it it made sense. \n\nMy mom had the ultra spicy bowl- it is ultra spicy! The broth is extremely rich in flavor and a bit salty if you're used to eating lighter. My mom asked for a cup of hot water and poured the whole thing in and when I tasted it, I couldn't tell it was \"watered\" down. \n\nMy dad and I had the pork bone base and I added extra chashu on mine with bamboo shoots and it was amazing! I didn't find the pork bone base as salty as my mom's so I thought it was super UMAMI. \n\nI wasn't super impressed with the chicken karage- i didn't care for their version of the batter but it was still juicy on the inside, but not as flavorful. \n\nMy kiddos loved their steamed version of their gyoza- it was soooo good! :)",

        "text": "This is my favorite ramen spot in the ATL! And I've tried SEVERAL! I normally get the Shoyu ramen (it's vegan!), and my husband gets the Shoyu add pork. Most of their ramens are served as a base and you have options for add ins. The shoyu comes with kale, corn, bean sprouts, fried onions, and chives. I normally add mushrooms, extra corn, and their version of a spice bomb (bokudan sauce). Fresh, prompt, and nicely packaged. And the noodle to broth ratio is perfect! \n\nI've only done take out from here so I can't really speak to the ambiance or dine in customer service. But if it's even close to my take out experience I'd give it a 10 out of 10. \nThe ramen always travels to home (about 15-20 mins) in one piece. Heating instructions are super easy. Pour the broth on the noodles and other ingredients, microwave for 2 mins,  and boom--best ramen in ATL! If you dont like the microwave, I'm sure you can heat on the stove.",

If they ever get really busy it won't be good. However, the ramen is nice. I also tried the Okonomiyaki which is like a Japanese pancake. It was all pretty tasty. I've visited twice.
