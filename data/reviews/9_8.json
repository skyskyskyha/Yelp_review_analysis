I will be visiting again very soon! \n \n\nOnly reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because they automatically add  gratuity. It was only 2 of us.

        "text": "I went on a Friday evening, around 7pm and it wasn't too packed, gratefully so. There was no wait and we were seated rather quickly. We were celebrating a birthday and we let them know and they did a really cute birthday cheesecake kinda thing so that was nice!\n\nPricing was decent I'd say. $18 for 6 rolls is average for an Atlanta sushi place, so I wasn't complaining. If you're someone who likes to do more than 6 rolls (ie. me) it might rack of up in price. Id say the sushi was a good 6/10! It was good, not amazing, but I feel like I'd order the same thing again.\n\nOne thing to note: gratuity is automatically added to the bill. Groups of 4 is 15%, groups of 5 is 20% and so forth I believe. \n\nParking is located behind the building in a secure spot. Like I mentioned, when we went it wasn't packed so finding parking was easy. Just be sure to validate once you get to the restaurant.\n\nOverall, I'd give my experience a 6/10. \n\nI think most of the hype comes from the presentation. Drinks in a pretty bird cup and the figurines with your sushi do make for good IG shots, but other than that it's your regular sushi place. Ambiance was very lowkey, dim lights and the likewise which would be great for a date night.",

        "text": "Really enjoyed dinner here. Melisa our waitress went above and beyond to accommodate us and answer any questions we had in regards to the menu. Ended up getting the Gyoza, and Peppered shrimp to start. The sauce with the Gyoza was thicker than usual; sweet yet tangy, but it really did the job. The peppered shrimp was really flavorful. The pepper sauce came on the side which made it better for those who wanted to dip their shrimp and not have it drowning in the sauce already\n\nFor the entree I had the Pappardelle Seafood. Thick pasta noodles with an array of seafood (shrimp, mussels, etc). The curry was sweet and savory, but if you're not into that when it comes to curry I wouldn't lean towards it. But it's worth the go if you're down for new things. This was my first experience so I'll definitely be coming back here again.",

First of all, this place is super cute. Nice ambience and very eccletic atsmosphere. Second, the food is AMAZING. My friend and I shared a crab cake and we both got the crab legs. They are delicious. I have never tasted a sauce like that on crab legs before. It was perfect and we were stuffed. Third, the drinks are cute but still strong enough to be worth the money. Lastly, service was impeccable. I am bringing my mom here for her birthday. Definitely a spot that you must try, even if you aren't into Thai food. There's something here for everyone.

I'm not a sushi girl but I knew that she would thoroughly enjoy it so we went on a Friday night. I made reservations and though the line was literally out the door, my reservation was honored and they took my license plate number to make sure we didn't get towed from the parking deck right next door. \n\nI ordered the Brussel sprouts, crab cakes and the gyoza for starters and the Crab Fried Rice for our entree. The wait staff was really friendly and attentive and even when I didn't like my virgin drink, they gave me something different that I was able to enjoy. The Brussel sprouts were everything. Seasoned to perfection, crispy on the outside and the sauce was amazing. The gyoza was excellent and I won't even get started on the crab cakes which were juicy and filled with crab meat. The remoulade sauce that came with it was great too and it reminded us of Maryland. My entree, the Crab Fried Rice came with a sweet dipping sauce which I thought was different and though I probably wouldn't get again (because the rice was a bit dry), I'd definitely eat the crab legs with that sauce again. Overall, 9/10 experience in Osha Thai, which had a great atmosphere, good food and a nice waitstaff.",

Be sure to make a reservation bc the restaurant is small and if you don't have a reservation you will most likely have to wait a very long time to be seated. Luckily this place is located in a spot with valet or self park garage parking. The food comes out presented very nicely. Some of their dishes come out with really cool props. The cocktails are fun but not strong so your going to need to order plenty! I've been twice already and will definitely come back to bring friends visiting.",

I loved the salt and pepper shrimp, the sea bass, the seafood pappardelle entrees. The coconut based soup (sub shrimp for chicken) was also yummy!\n\nThey have great service and offer specials on drinks depending on day/time. \n\nIf you haven't been here, give them a try- you won't be disappointed.",

Osha doesn't skim on either. \n\nFood: We ordered calamari for our appetizer, King of the Sea roll, and the Pappadarelle Seafood as an entree, all to share. All were delicious, but the Pappadarelle Seafood stole the show! This was a seafood pasta filled with shrimp, calamari, clams, and mussels, covered in a a creamy sauce that gave spicy, with a hint of sweet. We were completely obsessed with this dish. \n\nDrinks: We had a couple of rounds of the Butterfly Kiss. Delicious and super cute! This gin, lemon juice, and house-made syrup cocktail comes served in a bird glass, garnished with lemon peel and a cherry. \n\nParking: There's free parking in the garage right behind OSHA. You will need to give the receptionist your tag number at entrance. \n\nOver all: It's great! We're already planning our next visit with a group.",

        "text": "Heard so much buzz on TikTok about this place so I had to give it a try. I went here to hang out with one of my best girlfriends. Prior to coming here I made a reservation for us both. The time I went it wasn't that packed but still had a decent crowd. I was a little late to my reservation on account of not being able to find the actual restaurant LOL. \n\nParking: The restaurant has a parking garage next to their establishment. During peak hours, it can become pretty congested. Make sure you get a photo of your license plate to show the hostess so they can validate your parking. \n\nFood: I came here to mainly try the King Crab Rice Plate which was the most popular dish that was getting attention. Our server was very attentive but not too overbearing. For drink, I ordered a glass of rose, and my appetizer was my go-to calamari. My entree was the famous King Crab Plate and let me tell you all IT DID NOT Disappoint!!! Like, not at all!!!! Warning there's this sweet and spicy sauce on the top of it that will make your hands super messy. Just make sure you're not wearing anything delicate or white. My friend got the Prosecco and the drunken noodles as the Entree.\n\nAmbiance: O'Sha does a great job at exhibiting great Asian art by making it original. I loved looking at the wonderful painting and beautiful light fixtures that really make this place great for remarkable photos. Their bathroom was even lovely with different types of flowers on the wall. \n\nOverall Experience: I enjoyed trying this place out and it won't be the last time.",

They gave him a complimentary desert, key lime cheesecake with a graham cracker crust, it was so good. \n\nEverything was fresh, flavorful and had immaculate presentation. We ordered appetizers to fill out the menu, crab cakes and shrimp tempura, followed by the King crab fried rice and the Whole fried snapper. Everything was cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the pretty drink in the bird glass, not sure where my picture went, but it had a unique sweet and sour flavor. OSHA your chef is amazing  and thank you for such a wonderful experience.

        "text": "My girlfriends and I decided to check out Osha since it's just a few miles down from the job. We arrived around 5pm on a Thursday and because of the early start, we wanted to take advantage of their happy hour. \n\nParking is convenient - you may park at the attached garage and walk a few steps over, just be sure to know your license plate number to give to the hostess upon arrival. When we checked in, the restaurant had just opened but there were already a few patrons waiting for tables. We were seated at a booth near the window. The ambiance of this place is hip, romantic and funky with Asian décor throughout. We were given two really large menus and when we expressed interest in happy hour, the server grabbed another menu. \n\nI must say, I'm really, really confused about the happy hour here. Generally, one would think that happy hour means discounted food and drinks - but according to the menus presented to us, this was not really the case. Nevertheless, we ordered a round of drinks and some appetizers to share. \n\nFor my drink, I tried to Rose All Day: vodka, grapefruit liqueur, lemon juice, syrup, French bubble - $13. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts - $11, the shrimp tempura - $10, and the calamari - $11. I'd say everything was decent but nothing was incredibly delicious or mind-blowing. We weren't really charmed by our server either - who seemed nice but was also anxious to get us out of there. We originally intended to come here for dinner, but following a short experience with the food and service, we decided to drive a block down the street to a better Thai restaurant that evening for dinner.",

        "text": "It's a no for me! \n\nI made reservations for a Friday at 7:45pm a few days in advance. The idea to visit this spot came from my sister. She said there were great social media recommendations for it. \n\nLocation: it's easy to find. If coming from the buckhead area you should see it on your right. If you reach R. Thomas Deluxe Grill you have passed it. There is ample parking in the attached garage. Note: be sure to have your tag number to give to the host to validate your parking. \n\nUpon walking in, it was clear that this place was popular.  Just about every table was taken, to include the seats at the bar. As such, I would highly recommending making a reservation instead of just walking in. Additionally, if you are one that is concerned about being in close proximity to others not in your party, this is NOT the spot for you. \n\nWe started our night off with cocktails. The drinks that we  tried were as follows: Rose All Day, Laughing Skull, Geisha, and Butterfly Kiss. I tried all of the dunks and loved mine the most, The Laughing Skull. \n\nFood that we tried: Brussels sprouts, fries, papaya salad, Crispy Whole Red Snapper, and the Seafood hotpot. The fries were ok. Honestly, the sauce is what made them. The Brussels sprouts were good, just not anything special. The salad was trash. I mean there was no effort to add flavor to the dosh. They literally shredded up some ingredients added them to a bowl and presented them-- BORIMG!! The Red Snapper, how can I say this, very plain and lacked a good flavor. The seafood hotpot was just a disappointment. I honestly feel like I did not eat at the same place that all of the 5 star reviewers dinned  at. This place is average at best, based solely on the taste of the food. The below average rating is based on a combination of the average food and the below average service. This place is slow. We waited forever for everything, except water refills. They were on top of that! \n\nAs I stated, it's a no for me. However, given all the rave reviews I would encourage you to make your own judgement.",

They offer complimentary parking in the parking garage, just provide the hostess with the tag number of your vehicle.\n\nI made reservations a few days prior and I'm glad I did because they were pretty busy on a Friday night. We were seated quickly and our server greeted us promptly. They have an interesting cocktail menu. I chose a geisha girl for the first drink and while the presentation was great, the liquor was lacking. The lychee martini was also weak and was a let down. Also, I'll ask them to skip the feathers in my drinks the next time I come because I saw a few women put the feathers in their hair for pics I guess.  I sampled the crab cakes and they were delicious, but they're tiny. The calamari was excellent and seasoned well. The star of the evening for me was the crab fried rice that includes a crab cluster. It was amazing! The rice was fried perfectly and the sauce that was on the crab cluster was soooo good. Even the side of butter was really good. \n\nThis place is so cute and the food was exceptional. It's barely been a week and I'm already plotting my return.",

        "text": "Whew Chile .. The hype is real . Real disappointing that is . \n\nI first want to give credit where credit is due . The set up here is super cute and Instagram worthy . From the decor to the food & drinks . They did a great job of capturing the culture. \n\nSo we of course started off with appetizers . We ordered the spicy truffle fries which were pretty good and the brussel sprouts which were also pretty good . Our drinks were pretty amazing from taste & presentation. \n\nSo one of our guest is a vegan and  she opted for the papaya salad which lacked of flavor and we could all vouch for that . So she sent that back and just asked for another side order of fries because it wasn't much on the menu she could actually eat. So the red snapper fish that my sister ordered for her entree and my steam pot boil finally arrived after we had been waiting for sometime which later on our server mentioned they are behind on orders . She lacked communication from the time we arrived to be honest . \n\nSo to say the least we were excited  about this place for nothing‼ My entree definitely lacked flavor and it included shrimp, mussels, & calamari . My sisters fish was a blur as well . On top of it our other guest fries still were not out to the table so we mentioned it and she stated it would be a little while longer . We mentioned we our ready for our tabs and that she could just cancel the order . Also be sure to note they automatically add a 18% gratuity to your bill. \n\nI never have to go back to Osha ever again in life . This was such a let down because I had such high hopes that they were more than just pretty pictures and photo ops .",

There is better thai cuisine in atlanta.\n\nThey validate parking but tell them when you check in!",

They have options for indoor and outdoor seating. \n\nOnce seated the waiter was nice and went over the menu with us and answered any questions we had. He helped me pick my drink (Lions Tail), which was delicious and it came with a cute feather. \n\nI ordered the brussels and salmon nigiri to start. The brussels could've been crispier and the apple Gastrique was really sweet. I would've preferred less on the brussels. For my main course I ordered the Fuji Yama San sushi. The plating of the sushi was really nice. It was decorated with an aquarium ornament and white rose. The sushi was really good.",

We had the crab cakes and shrimp tempura skewers for appetizers -- both were quite good. For dinner, I had to pappardelle seafood pasta and my friend had the snapper. Super taste and good portions. And the best thing was the drinks--tasty with a pretty presentation! I gave it 4 stars because I got pretty bad food poisoning right after and believe it to be the shellfish. Atlanta is no where near a large body of water so I should have known better. Nonetheless, I'd return--avoiding the shellfish and recommend to others.",

        "text": "We came to Osha in the recommendation of a friend and I'm glad I listened because this place was all around good.\n\nThey are located right on the corner across from bell street burritos. So don't drive past it like we almost did. I couldn't tell you about parking because I took an Uber. But, I did heard that they validate.\n\nUpon entering, the waiting area was fairly small so definitely make reservations. Although we did make reservations in advance, we waited maybe 5minutes or less for our table so not bad. But, on the way to the table I got to see the whole layout of the restaurant and the decor and it's pretty nice in there. I do have to say the bar area is kind of small I kept seeing guys at the bar not sitting in their chairs and obstructing the walkway for the waiters and waitresses to bring food and drink. \n\nAnyway, for our drinks I got the lychee pearl martini which was nice, a little strong but I want my money's worth so it was perfect. My friend got the black swan martini she liked her drink as well it was more sweet. Both came with a cute feather on top.\n\nFor our appetizer we decided to split the Gyoza and the Picasso roll. It had spicy scallops and avocado on the inside and red tobiko and jalapeño on the top, it was perfect both had great flavor.\n\nFor our entrées I decided to get the seared salmon it comes with crispy green beans, white rice, w/ red curry on top of the salmon. Even though it sounded like a somewhat basic dish it was a very delicious and filling dish and I'd go back just for that. My friend got the ginger queen which was basically crispy mahi-mahi with vegetables and it came with a side of rice. I got to try her dish and I thought it was very flavorful and delicious as well both dishes are large and could probably be shared. But, don't listen to me they might charge you a sharing plate fee if you do that lol. \n\nI feel like our experience would've been five star had our drinks not taken 30 minutes each time to receive but, it was a busy Saturday night so I get it. All in all this was a great experience the food was amazing, service was good, and I definitely want to go back.",

        "text": "Tried Osha Thai Sushi Galleria with a friend for brunch and was thoroughly impressed! We were met by the host with a warm greeting and she  walked us through the parking validation process. All you need is your tag number and you are all set. We were then and allowed to choose our table as the restaurant was not very packed which was shocking for 1:30 on a Sunday. Once met by our server, he discussed drinks and apps with us. If you choose the bottomless option, you could choose between various flavors or prosecco. We both had bottomless pineapple mimosas to drink. We started with shrimp tempura and brussels which were both delicious. For our entrees we had the hardest time deciding, but our server made great suggestions. We settled on the steak frites, malted waffle to share, and salt and pepper shrimp. Everything was delicious, fresh, and at an amazing price point! The atmosphere was warm and cozy and wasn't too stuffy. We love to dress up, but it's good to be able to dress down and simply enjoy each other's company in a comfortable environment. The restaurant closes at 3 pm on Sundays to prep for dinner so we felt a little rushed toward the end of our meal and the good service began to fade as they began other tasks. Not horrible, but you could sense a shift. This is the only reason I did not give a 5 star rating. Over all we thoroughly enjoyed our time and will definitely add this to our rotation of restaurants!",

        "text": "I was excited to come here for an early birthday dinner after seeing all the great reviews and pictures. I pacificly made the reservation at 5:15pm on a Friday so that my friends could enjoy happy hour from 5pm-6pm. So imagine my disappointment when I waiter stated happy hour is only Monday- Thursday now  I was be beyond annoyed but it didn't stop the show. \n\nThe cocktail shaped like a bird was only ordered for picture purposes, the taste was good but the price was not, $15 is crazy. The chicken skewers were really bland, more seasoning and spices was needed. My sushi with eel was definitely the best thing of the night, no complaints there. My friends skirt steak was nice and juicy and the garlic fries were delicious. The night ended with complimentary shots, which were so good. Overall, service was great, the sushi was delicious and presented even better and the atmosphere is very serene. I'd go back again when in the area. P.S. park in the garage and  take a picture if your tag for validation.",

We had the tempura shrimp for starter  followed by the Crying tiger ribeye steak and then the Muay-Thai  sushi for our main. The shrimp tempura came skewered like lollipops covered in a sweet chill sauce and absolutely fresh. The steak was a tad under for medium rare when it hit our table but they got it on point second time around. The pairing of the fries and the flavor bomb crying tiger sauce that came along were a big highlight of the experience. The sushi was also very light, clean tasting and refreshing...simply put I've return to eating sushi because of it. \nLastly we had the \"black swan\" and a couple of mixed drink/shots from the bar. Results had us leaving with a big smile and a whole lot of heart for OSHA. We will be back!",

        "text": "New-ish restaurant that opened in the former Saltyard space; there's still Saltyard sign out front.\n\nWe tried to make reservations over the phone but were told it's first come first serve. No problem. When we got to the restaurant however, the host said they don't have any seating available. When I pointed to the dozen of empty tables, he said they were reserved. Go figure. \nMusic was also a bit obnoxious and not fitting the restaurant. Just a club-like repetitive beat. \nThose are my only two gripes with the restaurant.\n\nWe ended up getting a table and were promptly greeted. I didn't try any drinks - dry January :( - but they have an interesting drink menu with unique presentations. I saw a bunch of cocktails with feathers in them go by.\n\nWe tried gyoza, pearl harbor (salmon sashimi with ikura), salt and pepper shrimp, and muay-thai roll (in: Tuna, avocado, cucumber on: Salmon, Yellowtail, Thai chili). I wish they had brown rice. Oh well. Everything was delicious nonetheless. I'd give 5 stars if not for my two gripes described earlier.\n\nOverall: plenty of free garage parking, great service, lovely interior, full bar, delicious food, confusing reservation process.\n\nWill definitely be back to try their drinks and other food items.",
