                "text": "A friend of mine local to Atlanta treated our group of 3 to lunch at Bone Garden Cantina. It was a Saturday around 1pm when we walked in. There was a short wait, less than ten minutes, and we were taken to a table. The staff were friendly, despite how busy the restaurant was (no open tables). \n\nWe enjoyed chips and queso as an appetizer and I have to celebrate this queso. The texture was so smooth and it tasted fresh and not like fake cheese. There is a slight kick to it, but I wouldn't say it's spicy. Our food came out quickly and there were no complaints from the table. We enjoyed one of the specials - the steak adobo quesadilla, a house salad, and the birria brisket enchiladas. \n\nThis is a great cantina vibe restaurant for lunch and we enjoyed the ambiance and flavors! I would definitely visit again if I'm in town.",

                "text": "So taking bites of my s/o and friends dishes and my sangria are the reason why this review is not a 2. \n\nI ordered the tamales and hated them. This is a strong word I normally don't use to describe a bad dish, but they were awful. I'm not sure it was a bad night or if tamales are not a usual dish they sell, but I highly recommend not ordering them. I tried their chicken and pork one. The chicken one was incredibly dry. The tamale corn part was dense and dry. The chicken itself was not flavorful and dry. The pork one was better, the pork was juicy and tender but once again the tamale tasted dry... a bit stale? It's hard to describe. Overall this dish wasn't... good and if I ever go back I will not be ordering.\n\nHowever my date and friend ordered the steak tacos and birria brisket enchilada were delicious. Totally would have loved both of them.\n\nThe drinks, service and environment were friendly and had a good vibe. I recommend checking them out.",

                "text": "While on a trip to ATL, a large group of colleagues and I decided to go to Bone Garden Cantina for dinner. The d\u00e9cor was so fun and this was definitely a unique place to visit. As someone from Texas, I wasn't sure what to expect for Mexican food in ATL but I was curious to see how it compares to our Tex-Mex. \n\nWe decided to order a large variety of things to share as a group in addition to our individual meals. I tried the following: \n- House Margarita: I love a good margarita and this wasn't it. I thought it tasted very watery and like the margarita mix was store bought. I didn't order a second and wouldn't recommend this. \n- The Three Amigos: average trio dip with chips. This is a standard appetizer to order so I would order it again even though neither the queso nor guacamole were \"great\". \n- Birria Brisket Enchiladas (without tomatillo sauce): The flavor was good but this definitely had a kick to it. \n- Banana Empanadas: I haven't ever had a banana empanada so this was good to try. Of the two desserts, this was my favorite.  \n- Almond Flan: An OK desert that was fun to try \n\nOur entire group found the meal to be very spicy to the point that not everyone was able to eat their food despite it being delicious otherwise. If you have a low spice tolerance (like me), I would suggest asking the server. As for service, it was OK. Our server was friendly and did her best to accommodate such a large group but the other staff in the restaurant were a bit short with us if asked a question. \n\nAll in all, I'm glad we tried it but it isn't a place I plan to go back to if every in ATL.",

They do not take reservations, and it's first come first serve, and most of you party needs to be there before you get seated. Parking is free in the lots. You can drive around back and the restaurant is there on the backside or you can park in the front and just walk up the stairs and through the breezeway, you'll see the outdoor tables as soon as you walk up the stairs. \nWe always order The Three Amigos and someone always gets the solo chorizo enchilada. I'm always switching it up and can't say I've had anything I do not like, I do lean towards the camarones enchiladas, the tinga de pollo taco, al pastor taco and the carne adobo taco. Margaritas are delish - recommend the Texas Margarita. \nThe servers and bartenders are always friendly and helpful. Definitely worth the visit.",

Drive around until you see the colorful patio, and parking is free. \n\nVenue and Atmosphere \nThis restaurant is owned by the same people as the Vortex, and the influence shows. The restaurant is decked out with ornate skeletons on motorcycles, as well as massive sugar skulls. \n\nFood and Beverages \nMy tacos (chivo: goat, pollo: chicken, and al pastor: steak) were perfectly marinated and cooked. Their house guacamole was also super fresh and the salad dressing should be bottles and sold in stores. It was that good. \n\nThey don't have any frozen margaritas, but the tamarindo on the rocks was refreshing.  \n\nService \nOr server was friendly and game great food/drink recommendations.  \n\nVerdict \nWriting this review made me hungry for tacos again... it's safe to say I'll be back.",

Came here on a Tuesday evening at the recommendation of some friends and am so happy we did!  When you arrive, it doesn't look like there is a restaurant there.  It looks like a bunch of office buildings, but don't be thwarted, you are in the right place.  There is ample, free parking and you can park on both sides of the building.  Once you walk inside, it is giving \"day of the dead\" vibes!  Love the decor.  There was so much to see that I didn't get pictures of everything.  They have a great drink selection and they have horchata, which is a favorite of mine.  I opted for a drink called the creamy ho, which is horchata with alcohol.  It comes in a small glass and you really don't need much.  It's frothy and full of cinnamon and vanilla.  I ordered the chorizo enchilada and my friend ordered the chicken burrito and her and I split the entrees.  I didn't even get a pic of the food because it smelled so good that I began to dig in!  The chorizo enchilada has a mole type sauce on it and WOW!  The chicken burrito is pretty standard as burritos go, but the chicken is very flavorful!  It is served with a green salsa in the side and I could drink that salsa because of how delicious it is!  It is spicy, so if you don't like spicy, proceed with caution!  There are so many options on the menu that I want to go back and try something different each time!",

I will say I was originally somewhat turned off by a list of diner requests or rules on the back of the menu that more or less said if you don't like them, go somewhere else. I kind of expected uptight, snooty service but it was thankfully the opposite. Our waiter was fantastic. \n\nThe menu wasn't extensive by any means, but the options were typical Mexican fare with unique flair. Birria enchiladas! I highly recommend! \n\nI had my son with me, there's no kids menu, but I ordered him a taco with a side of rice. I will say after ending up eating his taco, I believe most of their food is seasoned at least moderately, so younger kids may not find entrees that suit them. This is one of the diner expectations, though, they state clearly on the back of the menu it's not a kids restaurant.\n\nI did enjoy the food, and I believe a good rating is fair based on quality and service. \n\nHowever, I'll stop at 4 stars because I likely won't have many opportunities to return. I do have a young child who is with me the majority of the time.",

Just the way I like it! The Pomegranate Margarita was delicious. It wasn't too sweet or too strong! It was just right! Lastly and most importantly is the service! Our server Yo was super friendly and professional! She remembered us from being there earlier in the week although she hadn't been our server then. This is our new favorite spot! It is pretty quaint, so there is usually a wait, you'll be close to your neighbors, but it is worth it! If you love Mexican food, top shelf service and drinks then this is the place for you!",

They were fast, friendly and we had a great conversation. Everything is priced extremely reasonable. The theming was so fun in this place and the server told us that the owner is the wife of the husband who owns the Vortex. You can definitely see this place is similar. \n\nMy husband and I started with the Chips and Salsa which had a bit of heat but super refreshing and you can definitely tell this is fresh and not canned. \n\nFor our entrees, my husband got the Spicy Pork Burrito which he loved. He loves spice and he said this was VERY spicy. They do not skimp on the spice! I ordered the Carne Adobo Taco which did fall apart which was disappointing but again, super fresh and delicious. I got that with a side of Esquite in the bowl aka Mexican Corn. This was super salty to me so I couldn't finish it but had it been less slow, I would have absolutely loved it. \n\nRegardless, I loved this place. This was my husband's favorite restaurant we went to on our WHOLE vacation. We would definitely be back if we were in the area and highly recommend if you love Mexican.",

The flavor is all there and the spice levels are on point.  If you like things more spicy then just ask for the arbol peppers on the side.

We didn't wait at all for an outside table on a Friday night either and food came out super fast. Inside decor is really cool but they blast the AC in there! \n\nWe started with a pitcher of house margaritas which were delish and strong. Our guacamole app was veryyy small portion wise but the fresh tortilla tips were amazing! We sampled lots of menu items including cheese quesadilla with jalape\u00f1os, rice and beans, shrimp taco, cauliflower taco, and fried yuca. The shrimp taco was special and the rice and beans was well seasoned but very salty. I didn't love the cauliflower taco flavor combos personally. Our friends had vegetarian tamales and two enchiladas which they enjoyed and said portions were huge. We were very full and happy leaving and didn't break the bank despite ordering a little of everything. I only wish there were more vegetarian options. Will be back!",

                "text": "My partner suggested that we come here after she came for happy hour with her coworkers and I'm so glad that she did. Let's get into it!\n\nLocation and Parking\n\nThey are located in an industrial complex in West midtown. You have to drive all the way around the entire complex as the restaurant is located in the back and on the end. There is a large parking lot so there's plenty of free parking to choose from.\n\nReservations, Venue, and Atmosphere\n\nMy partner and I did not have a reservation when we went, we went on a weekday so there was no wait and we were seated immediately. I could see it getting crowded the weekends, so I would consider calling ahead then. \n\nThe venue is very cute, they have indoor, bar, as well as patio seating. The atmosphere is causal, you can come here for happy hour with friends like my partner originally did, or you can come here for a cute and casual dinner date.\n\nFood and drinks\n\nFor drinks I got the Chief's Texas Margarita. It was delicious and strong. My partner had the pomegranate margarita, which she also said was strong but delicious as well.\n\nMy partner is a salad lover, so we started off with the Bone Garden Salad with grilled chicken. It was a good portion and could either be shared or eaten just by one person.\n\nFor my entree I got the birria brisket enchiladas, and it was just as good as it sounds and I'm not sure the photo does it justice. Two beef brisket enchiladas, with cheese and red sauce topped with sour cream and quest fresco. It was also served with rice and beans and a salad on the side. The beef was tender and flavorful, and the cheese and sauces were perfectly paired together. The rice and beans were also flavorful. My partner opted for tacos, she had the chive, Tinga de pollo, and the al pastor, all of which she raved about in between bites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n\nService\n\nOur server was great. She was attentive to our needs and checked in on us to make sure we didn't want or need anything. Food and drinks came out in reasonable time and it was all good. \n\nVerdict\n\nBone Garden in a hidden gem that I could definitely see myself coming back here and sharing a pitcher of margaritas on the patio with my partner or my friends. This really is a hidden gem of a space and I can't wait to go back. Good food, strong drinks, and a patio. What more could you possibly ask for?\n\nUntil next time!",

We loved the Hot Chile Margarita, the queso dip (which had a nice mild smoky flavor), and the Pipi\u00e1n Mole chicken enchiladas (covered with a mole which reminded us of a verde sauce with a bit of sharpness). The red salsa was not at all impressive - it had a slight taste of canned red tomatoes. The guacamole was very good, but the serving size was too small. Service was excellent, prompt, pleasant, and unobtrusive. The ambience is lovely, with a wide array of Mexican art celebrating Day of the Dead. Overall, highly recommended.",

Not to mention when we first walked in the host told us she couldn't sit us where we wanted to sit because then we would have bad service.

Unfortunately, we never got the opportunity to because after sitting down for 30 minutes, none of the waiters came to our table to even offer a simple glass of water to start. Instead, we watched as other tables that were seated after us ordered their food and drinks. At some point someone came over to our table, not to ask us if we wanted anything, but to ask if they could take the extra chair at our table. So after that, we left and went to Rreal Tacos instead. At Rreal Tacos we were able to order within 5 minutes of being seated. \n\n\nTheir live band was nice though. That was about it.",

The empanadas are delicious, and my friend SWEARS by the red goat soup- it is spicy and delicious.

A front of restaurant outdoor seating area is available. We sat outside inside, I wish we hadn't. Next time we come I will sit out front. The noise level in the restaurant was obnoxiously LOUD. I struggled hearing our server and the two of my guests siting just across the table. The crowd and music both too loud! The inside is small, so it feels very tight. Not much room. Everyone trying to squeeze by. Our server Jolie was great. Fun, full of energy. It was obvious she loves what she is doing and represented the restaurant very well. Very attentive, and great personality. The food was outstanding! Unlike your atypical Mexican restaurant, the food is uniquely presented and was clearly prepared with pride in their work. Two burritos, a quesadilla plate and I had enchiladas all with impressive presentation. At the center was The Three Amigos starter. Guacamole dip, Salsa, and Queso. Salsa was very average, little flavor, almost like tomato sauce. But, the Queso, and Guacamole were delicious! The tortilla chips were perfect, not to thick. Then one of my guests and I had the Tamarindo Margarita with a Repesado Tequila and a Chile-Sugar rim. So good! One of the best I have ever had. We will definitely come here again and sit outside this time. Thank you team Bone Garden. Ok so here we go with our DAVLIN rating.

There's an outdoor seating area in the indoor-outdoor space between buildings (that has so much potential once the other spaces are filled) that I wanted to sit at until we walked inside and WOW what a trip!! Such a fun, colorful epically themed Mexican D\u00eda de los Muertos interior. Very family friendly!\n\nI wolfed down the shrimp empanadas which were yummy and clean and filling. The elote was not bad but smelled a bit like mildewy towel which is odd. The cactus taco was alright a bit flavorless and the meat one was also meh, a bit dry. Next time I'll just order shrimp everything!",

                "text": "Bone Garden Cantina is super funky. It looks like Tim Burton ate some glitter then vomited it up inside. Unfortunately the inside did not look distanced at all; patrons and the majority of staff were unmasked. So, we chose to eat outdoors because of COVID; they have some seating on the patio. \n\nI was fairly turned off when we called asking about reservations, the guy who answered was pretty rude (and no, they don't take reservations.) They apparently reserve some outdoor seating for people with dogs; while we didn't have to wait long for our table, it was a little sad that they wouldn't seat us at an empty table in case someone with dogs arrived (although... while we were leaving we saw a couple sitting there with no canine in sight!) Our wait staff was friendly, otherwise I probably would give the place 3 stars. \n\nLuckily we were seated quickly; our waitresses came pretty promptly and were knowledgeable to our questions. We got queso, tacos, habanero salsa, goat soup, and an empanada.\nThe queso was fine, maybe not worth a retry but worth the calories. Tacos range from solid to dank; we loved the Al Pastor and our vegetarian comrades loved the cauliflower ones. The carne asada, chicken, and cactus ones were decent if a little underwhelming. The empanada was delicious and hearty; the birria soup was great as well. \n\nI think Bone Garden is a super fun spot to visit when things are a little more \"normal,\" it has a festive vibe and if you order right, you can have an equally enjoyable meal.",

The backdrop is bold and bright with skeletons straight out of a Dia de los Muertos festival. And 80's rock played (ala New Order's Bizarre Love Triangle) as the friendly host showed us to our socially distanced table. We're one minute into our visit and I already like this vibe! \n\nWe started with chips, salsa and guacamole. The guac rocks - just see my picture! For my meal, I tried a pork tamale (don't recommend - not bad, just not awesome) and a shrimp taco (more, please!). The Mexican rice and refried black beans were my sides and are so worthy of trying. \n\nIn the midst of COVID-19, the staff wear masks and so do customers (except when seated and eating). There's also a clear sign on the door turning away anyone experiencing symptoms. And, as I mentioned earlier, the guests are socially distancing. \n\nIf we're in the area, we'll definitely try again. It's a friendly, vibrant spot and I'd like to explore the menu a little more.",

After one bite I informed the waiter that I would like something else and they informed me that they could not send food back or take the meal off my check because of a policy, which would be understandable if I ate more than one bite, but I couldn't stomach more than one bite of this horrid meal. 0/10 would recommend poor store policy and customer service. I ended up paying for a meal that I did not even eat.",

So so good and lots of spice. The service was really slow but overall loved the vibe here.",

The meals were fresh, hot, and my biggest issue is seasoning but it was extremely flavorful and I was shocked by the rice. There are a decent amount of options you can choose from but not too many that it becomes overwhelming. The second time we've gone (same meals), idk what happened but the flavor was just not there and we had to add condiments/seasoning to make it better. Still worth it.\n\nDrinks:\nThe drinks are delicious and TASTE LIKE THEY HAVE ALCHOL IN THEM! I do not care for the spicy/tajin rim they suggest but my friend liked it a lot \n\nAmbiance/Decor:\nI love places like this, not the traditional, modern style of restaurants. There's endless things to look and the decor are fun, colorful, bold and one skeleton you can pretend you're dining with!\n\nStaff:\nThe staff here are laid back, engaging, and look/speak in a manner that you can tell they genuinely enjoy their job. Both times had convos that went beyond the dining experience.\n\nParking: \nthere's great/free parking \n\nRestrooms: \nClean",

The guac was also quite good as well as the Jamaica drunk. \n\nThe place gets busy so plan accordingly and service is a bit slow.

Nothing seems  authentic about this place, very mild flavors. I don't recommend the red sauce. The chorizo empanadas were okay, but sausage flavor was not very present... but cooked well. If you like very mild flavors I recommend this place for you. Just a heads up, the restaurant is located in back side of parking lot. The meals are at a very reasonable price point, so I may come back to try different things. Just not the things I ordered this go round.",

It was my turn to buy and he had been griping about it for about a month now (Even with Covid)...lol. We were seated inside and immediately noticed the decor. Many hand painted skeletons and a unique twist compared to many other MEX restaurants. It was nice to experience the restaurant, as they took Covid serious, and had tables seated accordingly and even advised not to crowd the bar. \n\nThe staff was very polite and service was fast. We ordered drinks at the bar, waited for another 5-7 minutes, and were finally seated. We had peeped the menu and already knew what we wanted. I will say, the food came out EXTREMELY FAST. I don't think we waited 5 minutes when the food had arrived. Of course we had chips n salsa and ordered a queso as well. Queso was delicious and had jalapenos. The Salsa had a nice kick to it as well which was great, as I love spicy food! \n\nI ordered the Beef Enchiladas and my friend ordered the  Chicken Enchiladas. Both came with black beans, rice and a little salad on the side.  EVERY item is well seasoned and FULL OF FLAVOR! The beans are smooth and smoky, the rice is fluffy and nice, and the Enchiladas are cooked to perfection with sauce and covered in cheese. The entire meal was just Delicious! \n\nI do have a large appetite and did think the serving was moderate, but maybe I'm being picky. I thought they could have had more salad or more rice to size up the meal a bit. Next time I'll just order an extra side....  For our drinks I ordered 2 Viva La Vida Smoky, and my friend 2 El Double. Double def will get you toasty and the Smoky is something different. Delicious though. \n\nI will definitely be back and recommend this place! This is the best I've had in Atlanta thus far!  My LA friend approved as well. LOL. The bill was $75 including tip. (2) entress and 4 large Margaritas. Not too bad for 2 to eat...",

                "text": "Thankful for Bone Garden Cantina! They are open with outdoor seating. All Covid precautions being taken. Our server, Lacey, wore a mask but that didn't stop her from being attentive, bubbly, and overall a great server.\n\nVisited recently with a couple friends to catch up  after months of distancing. Happy to get out an enjoy a margarita pitcher. Didn't taste much tequila or the orange flavor that was supposedly infused but I knocked out as soon as I got home so it must have been in there! $34 pitcher? Sign me up. Good deal for good portion.\n\nI also ordered the guacamole. It was very creamy and a good appetizer. Not super spicy or flavorful but decent. Eventually I ordered a couple of tacos. The Chivo & Lengua. I've had the Lengua at more authentic spots and the flavor was always there. At Bone Garden, it was good but didn't pack as much flavor as I'm used to. However, the Chivo had a very flavorful sauce and a great taco. Thankful my server recommended it! \n\nOverall, Bone Garden gives decent food, has a lot of parking, and is following safety protocols but still maintaining a good amount of seating. I'd recommend and will definitely be back.",
