        "text": "This is a true 5+ Star restaurant. \n\nMy wife and I ate at Aria last night (3/20/21) for our 5 year anniversary. We arrived about two minutes before our reservation and were immediately greeted and brought to our table. The atmosphere was nice and quiet, well spaced out and with some really neat decor. Could tell right away this was likely going to be a solid experience. Jordan was our server and was extremely polite, professional and attentive. \n\nWe each had a glass of champagne to start our celebration. Presentation by Jordan was exceptional. He poured a taste first then poured our glasses at the table. I then had a pre-dinner cocktail, The High Five. It was a solid bourbon drink. \n\nMy wife and I decided (as we usually do) to share several things.  The pre-dinner bread was to die for. No extra butter or olive oil needed. It's perfect as is. We started with the beef tenderloin starter. It was amazing. Then we had the romaine hearts salad which was also delicious. Nice and light but plenty of flavor. Next we had the sashimi appetizer. Again...delicious. For our main we had the pork with seared broccoli. It was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned and simply delicious. It turned out we had the perfect amount of food. For our dinner wine we had a bottle of 2013 Fiddlehead Pinot Noir. Again...excellent presentation and they used proper Pinot Noir glasses. \n\nI have eaten at a fairly decent amount of nice restaurants in Atlanta. I'm going to go ahead and say it, and my wife agrees, Aria deserves a spot in at least our top 5. \n\nWill be back for sure.",

The duck is super juicy, crispy, cooked perfectly. \n- scallops were super salty... cooked well but too much salt that overtook the texture and overall dish. \n- steak cooked perfectly to medium rare. What I HATE about steakhouses is, I ask for medium rare and often times I get medium. I asked for medium rare!!! \n- lemon pound cake, you may say is not special enough to get it at a restaurant... but I loved that boldness to serve this so I said what the heck. Show me what you got and they definitely showed it to me! Amazing. The best lemon pound cake ever with rich ice cream on the side. Totally get it. \n\nOverall, delicious (but slightly small portion) food/place to treat yo self. Really friendly informative waitress. I'd say 9.5 Gryffindor points out of 10.",

Reservations aren't too difficult yet the dining room is always lively.\n\nWhy minus 1 star? They have a perfectly usable parking lot but they have a forced valet system. In this day and age, no one carries cash and it is always such an annoying experience to pull up and realize someone is going to be driving my car 2 feet to an empty spot I drove past on my way up to the valet, then I have to awkwardly leave them empty-handed because I just don't carry cash. Who pays with cash? Either get rid of the useless valet system OR set it up with a QR code for digital tipping, etc. If you intend to grow to a younger clientele understand your new, younger client base doesn't carry cash.",

        "text": "The fiancé and I came here for our 8th anniversary dinner.\n\nAtmosphere is nice and intimate. By that, I mean you do sit fairly close with other patrons so don't expect a ton of privacy. After our meal, I knew the table to our right were on a date and table to our left were a group of friends who hadn't seen each other in a while. Also it is really LOUD. With everyone so close together, you almost have to yell at the person across from you for you to hear them.\n\nService was good. Attentive. Great recommendations and  friendly.\n\nOur meal included:\n\n- Roasted Brussels Sprouts: A low point of our meal. Nothing special that I don't normally cook at home.\n\n- Pork belly: Delectable bites of super fatty pork. No seasoning really so it was bland and fatty with some sweetness from the jam, which was interesting. \n\n- Rainbow trout: My entree. Excellent sear on the fish and everything was seasoned really well. My fiancé who doesn't like fish even enjoyed it. The sauce purée was delicious.\n\n- Beef short rib: My fiancé's entree. Tender and well seasoned. Good but not as memorable as my entree.\n\n- Lemon pound cake: If you enjoy sweet/tangy desserts, this is perfect! Very strong lemon flavor and aroma. I could've eaten two orders of this alone. So good!\n\nWe also ordered several craft cocktails and unfortunately, our drinks all tasted very watered down without any real discernible flavors. I would stay with the wines next time.\n\nOverall, we had an enjoyable evening but this just wasn't a place that impressed or intrigued me enough to warrant a return visit. Next!",

        "text": "Aria has a lovely atmosphere. The interior is dark and romantic, with mirrors and beautiful light fixtures. \n\nThe appetizers we ordered were really good and honestly way better than the main courses. I was kind of underwhelmed by the main courses. I went a few months ago and I'm not sure if these are still on the menu, but we had the soft shell crab and lobster risotto for our appetizers. So good! The soft shell crab had a great crispy texture and was served over a salad with asian flavors. The lobster appetizer was creamy and buttery. \n\nFor the entrees, we had the short rib beef and the filet mignon. It wasn't really anything special to me. It was good, but not super memorable. I probably wouldn't order those again. I felt kind of let down because our appetizers had great flavor. \n\nWe also shared a bottle of $96 white wine that went wonderfully with the light and fresh flavors. Definitely a splurge but it made it a great date night.\n\nWhat made this place lacking to me was our service that night was very inattentive. Also a bug flew into one of our wine glasses, and when we told the server, she just drained the bug out and returned us the glass of wine that had the bug in it. It was an expensive bottle, and I think it would have been much better if she offered to replace that glass with a new glass of wine. \n\nA plus side was that valet parking was great and the parking attendant was very nice. \n\nIf you are in the Atlanta area, I would say just try out this place once for date night. It really is lovely. Hopefully you get better service than we did though.",

        "text": "Fancy Buckhead restaurant\nWe came here for an anniversary dinner. The staff was super attentive and the restaurant is very beautiful. We did feel a little rushed to order. They have very attentive service here so it was hard to tell if they were being super attentive or trying to move tables. They sat us by a very loud group having a work dinner. There is a small dining room and we were sat close to this group. The cocktails are delicious. The wine menu is extensive. The food was very good. They brought out a special dessert for us that had Happy 3rd anniversary written In chocolate on it. It was a nice experience. The only reason I'm giving a four instead of five because we felt rushed and the table by us was very loud. Also the wine list is super high end and I would appreciate some more basic choices. Overall a very nice place for a special occasion.",

Great safety precautions were taken, all employees were wearing masks and gloves, which we saw them change often.  Customer service was top notch, from our attentive server Batina, to the knowledgeable sommelier Andrew, to the assistant manager who checked on us often. We opted for the 7 course, preselected meal option, and it did not disappoint. I wish I could remember all the courses, but they were all delicious. \nThe atmosphere was intimate with low lighting and classic decor. This is the place to go for a romantic fine dining experience.",

Both dining experiences have been everything we could have asked for and beyond. The photos are from our last visit a couple months ago shortly after they reopened (we were one of two tables on the patio spaced far apart and all waiters wore masks and gloves).\n\nEverything we have tried here has been incredible. The lobster mac n cheese is one of my favorites - sooo good, with sizable chunks of lobster. I was sad when it was gone. The beet salad is also fantastic.\n\nYou honestly can't go wrong with any of the items on their (changing daily) menu. Ambiance and service are absolutely fantastic. They also have some great mixologists. Highly recommend for a date night or special occasion!",

The reason you come to aria is for the food. \n\nWe always pick a few snacks for cocktails. Be sure to try the Korean beef and black truffle burrata. For first courses, all the salads rock, but you're probably not here for that. Get the yellowtail!  Amazing. Always. \n\nPersonally I love the lamb loin. If you are a short rib person, it's good. The duck confit is done differently, and we haven't cared for it. \n\nThe sweets (a small nosh plate) at the end of the meal were terrible. First thing was some kind of nut merengue, followed by a super sweet nutrigrain bar and then some super sweet chocolate thing.  Yuck. Won't do that again.",

        "text": "Aria is a mainstay on the Atlanta fine dining scene with good reason, they deliver a quality experience with congenial hospitality and aplomb. While efforts have been made to appeal to a younger generation of diner, Aria clearly remains a favorite of a more established crowd. The food is tasty and broadly appealing; though rays of creativity shine through at times, parts of the savory menu are somewhat banal. Don't miss Chef Kathryn King's desserts, which are uniquely composed and amazingly delicious. The beverage program is another highlight; excellent wine and cocktail list. Overall a very pleasant and solid experience!\n\nAtmosphere\n- Recently renovated and modernized; the space retains an upscale feel without being overly stuffy and formal.\n- Great bar area at the front, though the tight quarters meant it wasn't fully utilized in Covid times. Would absolutely go back for more casual, small bites in the bar plus the beverage list, a winning combination.\n- Business casual was generally the dress, jacket neither required nor out of place.\n- Parking entrance is off East Paces, not particularly well marked. Early in the evening, it wasn't hard to get a spot. No valet or parking fees.\n\nFood\nThe cuisine at Aria is marked by quality ingredients and thoughtful execution. While flavorful, the menu offers little in the way of unexpected twists and turns. The flip side is that there are agreeable options for most tastes, including those not looking to go far afield.\n\n- Shareable Snacks ($8-12): These were all 3-4 bites and as the name suggests, easy to split. For a party of four, we ordered four items, which was perhaps even too much. The snacks were a highlight, with bold flavors and a global influence. Especially enjoyed the pork belly; beautiful camerlization and tasty chutney.\n- Starters ($16-20): The name is a bit of a misnomer, as these are very generous portions. Our group of four split two, after which we became quite full after this and the snacks. One dish is good to share for two people. The duck confit was crispy and moist, with a very generous portion.\n- Entrees ($32-48): A bit of a mixed experience. The trout and scallops were more uniquely composed; the short rib, while flavorful and well presented, was very generic and something we have made at home many times.\n- Dessert ($10-12): Wow, this was excellent. Feeling quite full, tried one option to get the jist. The lemon pound cake was moist and delicious, with the accompaniments (amazing in their own right) jazzing up the flavor and making for a very memorable conclusion.\n\nReturning, I think the ideal meal would consist of either a bunch of shareable snacks and an entree, or one starter split for two and an entree. The dessert is excellent, make sure you leave room! Aria does not skimp on the portions, so plan accordingly. A tasting menu ($86/person) was also available so long as the entire table partakes.\n\nBeverage\nOne of the best parts of the experience, starting with cocktails. Really enjoyed the Figure Drawings (Peppercorn Gin, Velvet Falernum, Grapefruit, Lime - $14) to start, nicely balanced.\n\nThe wine list is well-selected, with a strong array of options across regions at reasonable price points (most are $60-150).  Many of the selections are more unique, but are mixed in with some better known names. Our interaction with the sommelier was friendly and positive, yielding a strong recommendation for our tastes. We really enjoyed the Bruliam Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir ($118) with the meal. Wines by the glass were also great (most $15-18/gl).\n\nService\n-Very hospitable and welcoming, not even a whiff of condescension.\n-Attentiveness waned a touch as the dining room filled up, but overall a great job.",

        "text": "Fine dining at its finest!  Absolute and sincere compliments to the chef. The appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts - all delicious, fresh, and beautifully plated.  And everything that passed by us on the way to other tables also looked excellent. The atmosphere and ambiance were elegant. Everyone here was having a great time! \n\nThe menu changes daily, so there is always something new and fresh to try. Again, compliments to the chef for the creativity required to invent a new menu every day. \n\nThe staff here obviously have some kind of formal training in fine dining. They were all knowledgeable, friendly, polite, and knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nIf you are thinking about going here, make your reservation now! I called about a week in advance to make a reservation. They had no availability from 5pm to 9pm on a Saturday. Fortunately, the host was able to re-arrange some things and squeeze us in. Excellent service if you ask me! \n\nThis is undoubtedly an upscale place. I felt under-dressed wearing a button-down shirt, a nice wool zip-up, and a pair of dark jeans. Next time, I will change to slacks and maybe a sport coat (and there certainly will be a next time).\n\nYou must use their complimentary valet parking; there is no self park option. The entire parking lot is maybe 30 cars, so the valet doesn't move your car more than a couple of feet. It seems to me like an unnecessary formality. \n\nAll in all, I was incredibly pleased with our experience and I will absolutely be back.",

Every one in the room contributed to the flow of the restaurant ensuring all books and crannies were checked. \n\nAs for the food, every dish we order in our six course meal had no issues.\nIf you're testing this place for the first time and plan on sharing, they will offer to split your meal in the kitchen for you. TRUST the chef! If certain meats need to be cook at a certain temperature, let the chef take the wheel! I promise you that you will not regret it! \n\nCertain restaurants in this type of area may have you leaving hungry with a high cost bill but this place has its portion packed down! Please check it out! \n\nThe plates are affordable ...ranges around $15-50.",

From the time we pulled up the service was over the top - the valet, the hostesses, the bartender, and our waiter, Kim.  The food was all fantastic too, but what stood out the most was the service.  It was amazing and unlike anything we have experienced in years.  In fact, my wife and I could not remember when we last had such incredible service.  We had crab cakes, salads, sole, filet mignon, truffle whipped potatoes, and the warm cheesecake for desert.  The wine was perfectly paired with the help of Kim.  The food was all really good.  It looked amazing and tasted even better.  It was a great overall experience.  We highly recommend Aria and we look forward to going back.",

Well, still no more private.\n\nOnce seated, we waited 10 minutes before our server came by with water and our drink orders. I was starving so I put in a couple of starters and she suggested we put in our whole order. When she returned, we put in our whole order. 2 of our 3 apps came and they were fine, under salted. They must've read my last review because the Brussels shrank in size substantially. Then the issue. Our server, Kaitlin, disappeared. Approximately 35 minutes later and the tables around us had their food. We flagged down a different server for bread. Another server for more drinks. Kaitlin disappeared.\n\nFinally, we got the manager and he came by with our crab cakes. Kaitlin rushed out beside him, blaming the kitchen for the food delay, not acknowledging her absence.\n\nUltimately, the manager took off the crab cakes and our dessert but the meal was underwhelming, under salted and undersized. \n\nSo sad that this institution has gone down.",

        "text": "Located in the heart of Buckhead, Aria was our unanimous choice for our family's Christmas Eve dinner while visiting Atlanta over the holidays. \n\nOur evening started with Aria's convenient valet parking, a cheerful and inviting greeting as we checked in and two hours of outstanding 5-star service by Brandi, our totally professional server. \n\nYou've gotta love the classy but relaxed ambiance of this jewel on E. Paces Ferry. The spot-lighted jeweled dog sculptures will immediately catch your eye as you walk past the small, intimate bar with just a half dozen bar stools. \n\nThe dining areas are very tastefully done with a unique, almost jellyfish-like chandelier gently illuminating the dining room.  Aria even has arm rest pillows positioned beside the diners on the leather upholstered bench seating against the wall...a comfort first in my years of fine dining. \n\nChristmas Eve turned out to be a carnivorous night for our family of six with only two appetizers going the way of fish and foul. The Lump Crab Cake was delicious while the Crisped Boneless Duck Confit w/ red cabbage and applewood smoked bacon w/ natural jus was absolutely over the top...a best-in-class preparation of duck. \n\nFor entrees, we ordered 3 orders of the Short Ribs of Beef, two portions of the Slow Braised Berkshire Pork and a singular Black Angus Filet Mignon.  Paired with a bottle of 2015 Pouilly-Fuisse and a 2011 Casanova di Nero's Brunello di Montalcino...Wow...what a flavorful feast. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the Warm Chocolate Cheesecake with softly whipped cream and the Lemon Pound Cake with lemon custard and pineapple compote. Both plates completely wowed us. \n\nOur Christmas Eve experience at Aria was void of any Clark W. Griswold disasters...and exceeded our expectations in every way.  It was clearly a family holiday highlight...aria earns the solid nickel.",

However, upon walking into the restaurant, I immediately noticed the noise level was really high for a nice restaurant. \n\nThe decor is nice inside, like in an old movie. I like the design of the light in the middle of the dinning room. And was really happy that there is no table directly underneath the sharp pointy edge of the light. I'd be too scared to sit there lol\n\nOnto the food, we ordered crispy pork belly with cranberry sauce, foie gras, Duck confit, venison entree. Everything was tasty. I especially liked the crispy pork belly and the duck confit. \n\nOverall, a good dining experience. I really wish Yelp can do a half star rating too because Aria is a good 4.5 stars!",

        "text": "Aria is a popular fine dining restaurant in Buckhead. It opened March 2000 and is owned by the same group as Canoe. Located in a small white building surrounded by hedges and a big tree, it's easy to miss this restaurant on the corner of East Paces Ferry Road and Maple Drive. The entrance is in the back next to the valet stand. Valet is complimentary.\n\nThe restaurant isn't terribly big, consisting of a small bar and a single dining room with two sections of seating. The interior design is nice, but also a bit strange. From the entrance, you have to walk through this curtain of heavy beads through the intimate bar/lounge to the white-colored dining room filled with classical columns and avant-garde decor. There's a bizarre light fixture in the middle of the dining room which vaguely resembles a tentacled sea creature. There are two jewel-encrusted dog sculptures on either side of the steps leading to the dining room. The monochrome floral patterns on the upholstery is beautiful.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy, romantic, and intimate. There are white tablecloths and candles at every table. Seating against the wall is snug and you can hear the conversations of those sitting next to you and vice versa. If you don't like this, you can try to request to be seated elsewhere when making your reservation.\n\nReservations are recommended. Aria is on OpenTable and has offered 1,000-point reservations at times. Take advantage if you can.\n\nThe restaurant's menu changes nightly. The cuisine is New American with an emphasis on slow-cooked and sustainable foods made from high quality, local and regional ingredients. On any given night, the menu will feature about 10 starters and 10 entrees. Most starters run about $10-15 each and entrees $30-35 each. There's also a pre-set tasting menu that runs $68 per person. This is less expensive than comparable Atlanta restaurants such as Bacchanalia and Restaurant Eugene ($85 each).\n\nI love tasting menus, so that's what we went with. At Aria, each course of the tasting menu is described on the printed menu. There are no substitutions or optional courses. Accommodations can be made for those with food allergies. Here's a rundown of what I had, course by course:\n\n* Bread: House Focaccia\n* Course 1: Creamless Celery Root Soup - black truffles, Parmigiano Reggiano\n* Course 2: Crisped Tempura Octopus - roasted butternut squash, roasted peanuts, Fuji apple, mizuna, frisee, candied ginger vinaigrette\n* Course 3: Blue Ridge Mountain Trout - butter fondue, melted leeks, Hakurei turnips, baby carrots, fingerling potatoes\n* Course 4: Crisped South Carolina Quail - shaved Brussels sprouts, applewood smoked bacon, grain mustard vinaigrette\n* Course 5: Pan Roasted Loin of Venison - charred broccoli, Hakurei turnips, baby carrots, pearl onion petals\n* Course 6: Chocolate Espresso Cake - almond toffee ice cream\n\nUnlike other fine dining restaurants, there are no amuse-bouches or gifts from the chef at Aria. Just one bread course and then the items listed on the prix fixe menu.\n\nThe food was fantastic. The House Focaccia bread was exceptional. It was freshly baked, warm, soft, and herby. Also a little bit oily, it was served pre-sliced into rectangular strips.\n\nThe Creamless Celery Root Soup was delicious. It tasted similar to a cream of mushroom soup, but lighter. The hint of truffles was absolutely mouthwatering.\n\nThe Crisped Tempura Octopus was my least favorite dish of the night. While the octopus meat was fresh, its consistency felt relatively soggy or mushy and the thin layer of tempura batter wasn't crispy. The rest of the dish was great though, from the julienned apple to the delicate mizuna and frisee greens. The delightful ginger vinaigrette tied it together.\n\nThe Blue Ridge Mountain Trout was very good. The skin was perfectly succulent and crispy. This dish normally came with a lobster bisque sauce, but due to my food allergy, the chef specially prepared a butter and cheese fondue sauce instead. I particularly enjoyed the tender baby carrots and sweet and fruity Hakurei turnips.\n\nThe Crisped South Carolina Quail was phenomenal -- one of the best-prepared quails I've had to date. The half-quail meat was juicy and flavorful. The little bird had been expertly deboned. The Brussels salad and pork belly bits were icing on top of the proverbial cake.\n\nThe Pan Roasted Loin of Venison was excellent. The venison was cooked medium rare. The slices of meat were moist, luscious, and flavorful.\n\nThe Chocolate Espresso Cake was superb. Rich yet airy. I had to eat the almond toffee ice cream quickly before it melted away.\n\nService was good though a bit slow. Coats were checked and silverware and plates were changed in a timely manner. We liked our server and the other staff were nothing but polite and courteous. However, course pacing could have been better and we had extended waits on the check.\n\nOverall, Aria is a terrific restaurant. Do the tasting menu.",

They have a few controversial pieces here but the main dining room is actually quite austere with the chandelier being the main attraction. Other than that, it's white on white with white table cloths and walls. \n\nTheir bar is quite small and located right at the entrance but it's nicely stocked.\n\nFor mu drink I went safe and got my default Manhattan - pretty decent. \n\nApp: smoked salmon - ery good. Not a fan of creme fraiche all over the place though. \n\nMy maine dish: Roasted Venison Loin - a bit on the dry side unfortunately. My companion went with duck and I stole most of it off his plate. Note to self: If you want it, get it - even if you both order the same dish! \n\nOverall: good service, pleasant atmosphere, valet, random art which is always fun! \nI will be back again",

        "text": "Aria is a very upscale, 'special occasion' type place.  And since this was our anniversary, it seemed appropriate. \n\nWe made a reservation a few weeks in advance, though I don't know how quickly they fill up.  We arrived a bit before our 6:30 p.m. time slot.  Parking is valet, which is probably for the best as they appear to have a small lot.\n\nThe ambiance is dark/intimate.  If you enter during daylight, it takes a minute to adjust to the lack of interior lighting initially.  The dining room is a bit brighter.  We were shown to our table on what was apparently 'anniversary row', as the 3 tables all eventually featured couples who were celebrating theirs.  \n\nThe wait staff is all similarly uniformed and is very polished.  They know the menu, wines, drinks, etc. cold.  Even given the general price point of this place, the by-the-glass wine prices were noticeably high.  We opted to split a salad (which was still a hearty portion for each of us).  My wife had one of the fish options and I had the steak, which was quite good.  We split a dessert, which was also good.  \n\nPrices here are steep, but that shouldn't be a surprise given the overall quality of the food / service / atmosphere. If you're looking for someplace to make an impression, this is a good choice.",

        "text": "This was our second time to Aria. \n\nWe went for our anniversary four years ago and sat in the cellar for a special evening that didn't disappoint - aside from the ambiance, which was obviously top-notch, the service and food presented Aria very well. \n\nFor my 30th birthday, we decided to go back to Aria as a way of celebrating this important birthday through one of our old favorite restaurants. Unfortunately, we collectively regretted this decision for the following reasons:\n\n1). Many of the items from the menu that we ordered came to the table with ingredients missing. For example, per the menu, the salad should have had roasted corn on it, or the sashimi should have had green apple in it. For them not to mention specific items missing before bringing dishes to the table is not good service. I would even hold Cheesecake Factory to this standard of service.\n\nOrder:\n\nStarters:\nChickpea Fritters\nSashimi\nAvocado + Corn Salad \n\nEntree:\nScallops\nShort Rib\n\nSide: \nLobster Mashed Potatoes\n\n\n2). The scallop dish left me confused. The scallops themselves were cooked well. Aside from that, the rest of the dish lacked purpose. The \"sauce\" was extremely bland (just tasted like a watered-down butter) and the squash was undercooked. In my opinion it was missing an acid (i.e. citrus, tomatoes, vinegar, etc.) and salt, but really any pop of flavor would do this dish well.  Overall, I found myself underwhelmed and perplexed as to if this was how the dish was supposed to be prepared. \nSimilarly, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes lacked a lot of flavor. I think it could've used more butter, salt, and pepper. We ended up asking for parmesan cheese to add some flavor to the potatoes and that improved it a bit. In any case, a restaurant of this caliber shouldn't be missing on the flavor element.\n\n3). While the service was generally fine, the server did not address that it was my birthday till the end of dinner, almost as if he had forgot or wasn't told until the last minute. We've dined at all of the top restaurants in ATL for our birthdays and this was probably handled the worst. \n\nI'm not sure what's changed here between our visits but genuinely hope that this helps improve areas of weakness.",

They complementary valet parking so no need to worry about parking. \n\nWe stared with the arugula salad which was good. Next we went with the octopus dish and the lump  crab cake. The lump crab cake was the highlight very well executed adding the salad with it, the amount of saltiness was perfect. The octopus was good too but not as good as the crab.\n\nFor our main dishes we went with the snapper filet and the mountain trout. Again both were great but liked the snapper more. .\n\nFinally finished off with apple tart. It was good but nothing special.\n\nHere are my ratings:\nArugula salad: 8/10\nOctopus: 8/10\nCrab cake: 8.5/10\nMountain trout: 8/10\nSnapper filet: 8.5/10\nApple tart: 7.5/10",

Highlights for me were the crab cake starter served over a Vietnamese-style salad and the Brussels sprouts side, which was served with the filet (a perfect medium rare). There was plenty on the menu we'd look forward to trying on our next visit. I thought the broccoli side (served with the pork) was a bit bland, and I'd probably try the short rib over the pork next time around.\n\nI was also impressed with the restaurant's COVID measures. A lot of places have let those fall by the wayside, but tables here were very well spaced out, and the staff all wore masks and gave you your space. \n\nWill definitely return on future visits to Buckhead!",

The portions were tiny and the food was barely okay. For the price I paid, I could've had my fill and then some at other places for similar quality. \n\nFood:\nThe lobster entree/ tiny half of a tail on top of cold mash potatoes and sauce.\nThe duck entree/ two pieces of salty meat with beans.\nA salad to share/ only good thing we had. House-made croutons and crisp veggies. The radish slices added a nice burst of flavor.\n\nDessert: a variety of house-made sorbets -that was highly recommended by my server cuz my friend doesn't like overly sweet desserts. But these were all so sour! They all tasted similar and just overbearingly sour! No unique pops of flavors. Sorbets should be a nice balance of sweet and sour but these were just awfully sour with barely enough fruit sauce to sweeten it. They had a merengue chip on the bottom but that didn't compliment the flavors at all and was just too sweet. I was so upset! Dessert is always the last thing you remember from a meal and I'm left with a sour memory!",

        "text": "We found this place  when looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion and even when we live here, we decided to go for a recommendation from trip advisor for one of the most romantic places in Atlanta.  \n\nThe place is a small modern and cozy restaurant.   The environment is dimmed light and  tonight's crowd was either larger groups,  over 10 people, or several tables with couples.  \n\nThey change their menu, according to our server every day, so if I get the names wrong, I'm sorry :).  We started with drinks, I cannot drink so I had a virgin mojito and the hubby had an apple martini that looked very tasty and according to him it was as good as it looked. Tonight we had as an appetizer the crispy pork belly and the braised beef, both of them were very good, however, against what I usually like, the pork belly was superior.  As entrees we  chose the short ribs of beef and the scallops. This place specialty is the braised meats, so as you can imagine the short ribs were DELICIOUS!  Finally, we were celebrating so why not go also for dessert right? We had the brown butter and caramel cake, and to not lose track of the experience,  it matched the amazing flavor.",
