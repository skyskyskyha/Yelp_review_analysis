        "text": "We came here for a late dinner on a Friday night and had no wait whatsoever. They specialize in southern Italian food, so it's a nice blend of heavier dishes like Neapolitan pizzas and pastas as well as veggie dishes. They have smaller plates as well as shareable main dishes. We ordered the focaccia, cauliflower, grilled kale salad, and funghi sausage pizza. Everything we had was great, but there were a couple of things that could've been improved; the focaccia came without anything to top it with. I ended up using the focaccia to sop up some of the sauce from the cauliflower, but it would've been nice to have some olive oil or something saucy. The other thing was the fat/bitterness/acid balance of the kale salad- it may have needed a bit more acid. Other than that the pizza and cauliflower were phenomenal, and they had a blueberry seasonal mocktail that was herbal and refreshing. We also had a waiter that was informative and very attentive. Definitely come visit! Try the cauliflower and the pizzas!",

We had the garlic knots, meatballs, and arancini to start, and all 3 were excellent. The garlic knots are probably the best I've had anywhere. We each had something different for entrees, and with 2 vegetarians at the table, we were all able to find something that left us raving. The COVID practices really put us at ease. Tables were well separated and all employees wore masks. So many employees stopped at our table to check on us and made us feel like family (but also gave us space to enjoy our celebration). A must visit in Emory Village!",

While technically it's food I wouldn't say it was good food. There was something really off about the pasta and we were both looking forward to having pasta that night. Could have been an off night but it's hard to say.  For all the good reviews we were disappointed.  Would I try it again? sure but I'd have to let the sting from this visit go away first.",

        "text": "Castellucci does it again! Came by this evening with my SO and two friends. Our server was Daniel and he was a great sport, very friendly and fantastic service. We ordered two garlic knots and a Caesar salad for appetizers and were blown away from the start. The garlic knots were delicious- chewy, cheesy, garlicy. They smelled fantastic. The Caesar salad was sublime, and you could tell the dressing was homemade. You don't get a salad like that out of a bottle. It was amazing. For our entrees, we actually opted to not get pizza. My SO got the chicken parm and was delighted when he was brought out a separate portion of giant rigatoni as the pasta accompaniment. The portions are huuuge. One friend got the sausage orecchiette and thought it was delicious (also a giant portion in a huge bowl), and the second friend ordered the lasagna, served in a giant cast iron pan AND an arugula side salad. I ordered the chicken Alfredo, which comes with a hearty, thick, savory Alfredo sauce. The pasta was bucatini which was interesting since traditionally it's fettuccine! All of us had leftovers- you can easily feed 2 people with one entree.. and we LOVE to eat so the portions are definitely massive. 10/10 cannot wait to come back and try their pizzas and desserts.",

Right now the grilled kale salad is amazing (I know weird thing to say about kale, but the flavors are spot on). The chicken meatballs are super rich and have amazing flavor and you cannot go wrong with any pizza. I personally am a big fan of the OG. \n\nWe will definitely be back many more times to come.

A wonderful Italian menu, great drinks list, and a contemporary vibe--wonderful spot. \n\nThe food here is outstanding. Each dish was extremely well balanced, seasoned perfectly, and cooked to perfection. We've tried their pastas, pizzas, and man of their small plates. One night we tried a whole roasted fish dish that the chef had prepared with a garlic, herb salsa verde. It was truly one of the tastiest fish dishes I have ever had. I can not recommend their food enough. \n\nWe've also participated in their pizza making class, which is very fun! They tell all about their dough-making process, then each person gets to stretch their own dough and select toppings for their pizza before it's fired in their ovens. A very fun date night activity!\n\nOn top of all of this, their service is fantastic. We've had only the kindest and most attentive wait staff, and their recommendations are always wonderful. Love this place. Cannot recommend it enough!",

        "text": "Disappointed. \n\nStarting off, the restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. I've never been to the old location, but the atmosphere is very nice at the new spot. \n\nWe ordered the Pear and Farro Salad and Risotto to start, Lamb Cannelloni, Lobster ravioli and salmon for mains and the pumpkin ginger cake for dessert. For drinks, we tried the bitter truth cocktail and a couple glasses of wine. The cocktail was boozy to say the least, it was several alcohols mixed cold, and poured into a small glass and garnished with a whole slice of red pepper. Hard to drink, and not at all elegant in the presentation. The server was nice, and tried to be accommodating but honestly didn't seem like she knew much about wine. Stark contrast with the Italian-inspired restaurant in Decatur who seems to always have a sommelier on staff? \n\nThe pear and farro salad was not worth ordering. It was a base of seasoned farro which was actually tasty, then like 3 paper thin slices of pear, then big chunks of sliced endive on top which seemed like an afterthought. It was served with salad tongs with teeth so wide it couldn't pick up the farro, so we ended up eating raw bitter endive with bits of farro stuck to it. \n\nRisotto was tasty, except it was barely risotto. There's so much stuff in it, that there actually wasn't that much rice. The creamy texture of risotto is what's so nice about it! \n\nAs much as they try to tell you the mains and pasta are meant for sharing, it's not. They're small portions, and not served in anyway that makes them easy to share. They're far from 'family style' which is how it was described to us. What it feels like is tapping off of the 'small plates' trend and selling less food for higher prices. The lamb cannelloni and lobster ravioli were good, but not worth the high price tag. I will say the salmon was a very large portion and cooked to perfection, though the spaghetti squash/veggie mixture just didn't seem to go well with the salmon at all. \n\nThe star of the show was the pumpkin ginger cake. It was exactly what you'd expect from the name, just enough spice, not too sweet, very moist, super flavorful. One of the best desserts I've had in a restaurant in a long time. \n\nAll in all, this was a disappointment. Some things were winners, others were fails, but for the reputation and caliber that this restaurant is supposed to be, didn't experience it for this dinner. I will go back and try the pizza.",

I am disappointed to hear that your expectations were not met at Double Zero.  It sounds like you were least impressed with the pear farro salad and I can understand your frustration with the size of the salad tongs.  I also wish we were able to deliver a better value perception as it appears you were underwhelmed by the sizes of some of the dishes.  Family style is not exactly our goal with those sections of the menu and I can see how that would have been misleading.\n\nI would welcome you back to try the pizza as we would love the opportunity to try and make a better impression.

Well, Double Zero frequently came up so I decided to take a look at the menu. At first I was nervous because of the hefty price. I ordered the Bolognese to-go. \n\nSo I finally arrive to pick up my food and the restaurant instantly shocked me. The vibe was on point. It was so beautiful. I immediately texted my boyfriend to tell him he needs to bring me here for a date lol. The staff was so friendly and nice. I went to the bar to pick up my order and was a bit disappointed by the portion of my food.\n\nWhen I got home and took that first bite. OMG BEST PASTA I'VE EVER HAD. I could tell the noodles were made from scratch and the meat sauce was so good! It ended up being the perfect portion size because I was stuffed. I forced myself to finish every bite because I could not stop eating it. I can not wait to come back and try dining in. If take-out was so good, then dining in must be phenomenal.",

The thinly sliced fresh garlic that was fried was super yumm. Risotto was perfect. Just wished there was more, but those items where meant to be tapas in nature.\n\nMy wife had the tagliatelle and it too was OUTSTANDING. The meat had a slight crunch texture from a panko season mixture that made the dish sing.  The meat to noodle ratio was a bit off, in favor of the meat, but no one is complaining. Actually added it to my pizza.\n\nI had the Margherita pizza, and this was the only ding.  At first I loved the idea of cutting my own pie with scissors, but the novelty quickly wore off. Maybe because I was gussied up for the night and did not want to stain my nice duds and I was starving. In the end I found having to cut the pizza with some cheap scissors to be an small inconvenience. The pizza was a bit over sauced which caused it to be exceedingly limp and soggy, but it made for easy cutting.  I will say that it reheated nicely on my cast iron skillet moments ago and with a crisp crust, it was fantastic.\n\nDrink\nBeer selection was small, but I did not expect 32 beers on tap at an Italian joint. The wine and cocktail options where better, for the wife found a tasty red that was spicy and just dry enough.\n \nWe will be back.",

        "text": "It pains me a bit to write this review a bit because we loved the old location of Double Zero while it was still in Sandy Springs. Additionally, we love all the Castellucci restaurants in the area. However, the tapas style menu has its hits and misses. \n\nWe started with multiple of the small plates. The Burrata Panzenella was very salty, and it was the cheese itself that was salty which surprised us. The Gnochi di Pollo also underwhelmed with the dish being a little different that we expected, with the chicken thigh being a slab of dry chicken on the side of the gnocchi. \n\nHighlights from the small plates were the grilled kale and the smoked brisket arancini. But overall the variety of small plates that we loved about the old location was cut in half at the new location, especially with many of the meat options cut out of the truncated new menu. \n\nWe wanted to try the Lamb Cannelloni but unfortunately it was sold out for the night. Instead, we got tagliatelle bolognese and orecchiette pasta. Both solid pastas but not amazing. We also got a Margherita pizza that just didn't seem as delicately prepared as the old restaurant. \n\nThe service was uneven on the night as well. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the \"dough\" so it took quite a long time for our pizzas to come out. Additionally, we did not get the eggplant appetizer we ordered as well. Since it was a birthday celebration and for our delay, we got complimentary champagne at the end along with a free dessert for our troubles. \n\nWe were disappointed at our night at Double Zero just because we had so many fond memories of the old Double Zero. I hope that they expand the small plate menu a bit to include old favorites like the lamb and the mozzarella al forno. There unfortunately are better options in the Atlanta area for great Italian food.",

It seems very unusual that there would be any issue at all with the dough for the pizza, so I am looking into that specifically.  You are not alone in missing some of the original menu items and we are considering featuring some of the items you mentioned when we undergo our next seasonal menu change.  \n\nWe would certainly like the opportunity to improve and to win you back as a customer at Double Zero.  Please let me know if you are open to connecting a private channel so we can further discuss.\n\nThank you,\n\nFred",

I've never had foam so it was an experience!\n\nVery delicious flavors with the sausage and broccolini yet light and flavorful. Perfectly cooked orecchiette pasta as well. It is the creamy pasta dish I've been craving ever since.\n\n\nATMOSPHERE\nNice modern decor with big mosaic furnaces for firing pizza. There was a bar area that sort of separate from the restaurant with neon lights and more of a hipster Little Trouble vibe that I'd like to check out next time!",

It's in a nice big space so you don't feel cramped, yet it somehow still felt cozy.  There was some kinda hiccough with the service (that probably shouldnt have manifested itself as obvious as it did), but once that wrinkle was ironed out it really was a great dining experience.  It would make a good date spot, because it still has that intimate vibe, but could work for larger groups--there were about two parties of 10 or so.  I'd say it's one of my top places to enjoy elevated Italian cuisine.",

        "text": "My partner and I tried Double Zero on an impromptu date night and it was fine, but not great. I kind of expected more based on my stellar experiences at Iberian Pig (same restaurant group/owners).\n\nLet's start with service. Service was great! Five stars there. We were greeted, seated, and taken care of. Our server provided suggestions and spoke with the kitchen on our behalf when we had questions about vegetarian options. \n\nFood is where things fell a little short for me. We started with a dish called \"grilled kale\", and I was fully expecting grilled kale. Maybe I should have asked more questions, but the dish was more of an arugula salad with a few pieces of grilled kale scattered through. It was good... but I wanted kale, not arugula. Next, we tried the hummus and opted to have it served with raw veggies vs. bread since we were also getting a pizza (gotta watch the carbs). I certainly appreciated the raw veggie option but the hummus was lackluster. It was a bit watery and lacked depth of flavor. It was just missing something.  For our main course, we ordered the Cavolfiore pizza. It was my favorite part of the dinner for sure. It's a vegetarian pizza with chili marinated cauliflower, olives, leeks, and roasted red pepper. Just the right amount of spice and a perfect crust. I also enjoyed how the pizza was served with scissors to cut. Definitely easier than a pizza slicer. I had to google this because it was a new experience for me and apparently scissors are the way to go in Italy. Very authentic!\n\nLastly, the atmosphere.. it was very low key when we were there on a Thursday evening. The space is nice though so I would imagine it can get quite busy and bustling on the weekends. This would be a good date night spot or a good place to grab a drink, too. The bar is nice and they have a lot of unique cocktail options.  Definitely worth checking out.",

Any opportunity that we have to share this information, we are happy to do so as it is something that CANNOT be taken lightly. \n\nOur restaurant is following the guidelines of the CDC in all aspects, and we have chosen to take these guidelines even further throughout our daily operations which is mentioned in many other reviews on other platforms by actual guests who have dined with us. It is extremely important to all of us that this be felt with confidence by everyone who walks through our doors.\n\nThe person who is mentioned in your review had not been in the building for over a week when this information was learned. The contact that they had with others based on the CDC guidelines was minimal. All who had that level of contact were notified, and have not been back in the building since. They have all received testing, and will not be returning until they provide their results. \n\nA very well respected company was brought in to sterilize the entire building and the contents within it hours after we had received this information. This guaranteed that we would be able to have a safe environment for everyone to enter our building. \n\nWe can assure you that Double Zero and everyone who is involved takes these matters very seriously, and can state with absolute certainty that this environment is a safe place to be. This requires the participation of everyone by wearing masks, washing hands effectively, and sanitizing all surfaces. For our team, it means conducting ourselves wisely when we are not in the building to show respect to our fellow co-workers and guests. \n\nOpening to the public for the past few months has been a sensitive subject for everyone in our industry, including our employees. We are respectful of those feelings by operating with the utmost integrity and dedication to safety. I welcome any further conversation that you would like to have regarding this or any other matter by calling the restaurant.",

        "text": "I don't even know where to begin. Hands down some of the best Italian food in Atlanta. Came here on a Saturday night with my bff for dinner at 7:30 this past weekend. Valet was full but I snagged a street spot right in front of the restaurant. The location is on N. Decatur near the round about and next door to Rise-n-Dine. \n\nWalking in I was shocked by how spacious the place is. We were seated to the left at a two seater high top and on the right there's a big dining room with more traditional table seating. There's also a bar set up to the far left and in the back you can see the open kitchen area. \n\nWe were ready for a carb feast and wanted to try everything. We started off with a bottle of Viognier which was perfect and ordered the chicken meatballs and arancini to start. The meatballs were very good but ohmygosh the arancini was to die for. I was trying to eat it slowly to savor it. I recommend ordering your own set of arancini because you probably won't want to share. Next we shared a margherita pizza which was simple yet amazing. We found ourselves using the last bits of crust to scoop up any remaining marinara. We were still ready for more so I ordered the short rib cannelloni and she had the mushroom pappardelle. I'm not a mushroom fan so I didn't try hers but she cleaned the plate so it must've been good. I really enjoyed the unique flavors of my cannelloni which had a slight vinegar taste to each bite. I ended up having leftovers of it and Michael our waiter wrapped it up for me to go. \n\nThe service here was top notch. Michael always seemed to stop by at the right time and I guess he saw how enamored we were with our meal and gave us a free small plate coupon. I plan on using it in a few days because I need to get back here ASAP!",

The space itself is huge and pretty. A friend and I didn't have any troubles getting a table at 7 on a Saturday night. I ordered the kale salad, which was probably one of the better kale salads I've had! Lots of flavor with the lemon and garlic dressing, bread crumbs, spices and light cheese. I'd actually go back just for the salad. I also ordered the margarita pizza with an egg on top! The crust was perfect - light and tasty. The server brought out a pair of scissors to cut it (which I thought was odd) but definitely worked better than the knife. My friend had a pasta she really liked. Our server was VERY knowledgeable, kind and attentive. We will be back to the great restaurant in our neighborhood!'",

We had a simple, well-balanced arugula salad and delicious pork belly with a melt in your mouth Farro. The canneloni was hearty and so tasty. To top it off, the butterscotch budino was to die for! A creamy, not too sweet panacotta topped with an amazing sea salt caramel... And a yummy cookie. Crystallized rosemary on top was another detail showing the skill and creativity of this restaurant. We loved it all. Our server, Maya (senior ) was friendly and helpful. We will be back!",

I didn't feel like I had to shout to be heard.  \n\nThey offer small plates, pastas and pizzas.  In our group of 8, we were able to sample from each.  My top two faves were the artichoke al forno (a cheesy dip) and the funghi pizza.  Almost everything I had sampled was wonderful.   The only exception was the octopus which was quite dry and bland.  \n\nI would highly recommend going as a small group like we did so more dishes can be shared! I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu.",

At Double Zero we are trying to push the envelope on a new style of Italian, taking a spin on family style that is so popular in the Italian culture.  Our dishes are smaller by design so guests can try and taste many items all within one meal.  I apologize if this was not communicated to you at the table and do wish we had the opportunity to guide you better. Please let me know if you are in town again, as we would welcome the chance to try to win you back! Take care.",

This IS our go-to spot to take guests who are looking for something unique, unexpected, cosmopolitan - and delicious! \n\nThere's no doubt I was concerned at first after they moved in town and changed their menu. After all, we were big fans of the original location's menu, staff, and atmosphere: urban chic meets pizza and pasta.\n\nBut after several visits to the new location, they clearly upped their food game with an eclectic, gourmet take on small plates while maintaining some Italian staples. Most of the wonderful staff moved with them, and the atmosphere is even more electric. \n\nWords can't even describe how good the Arancini meatballs are.  They are a must-have!!!\n\nCastellucci's personal involvement is both evident and welcome - and we continue to love everything about this place.",

It was absolutely beyond good, amazing, delicious and perfection!!!! Me and my bestie kinda did a tour of the menu lol. We started off with arancini and chicken meatballs, my bestie said the arancini was really good I didn't taste them because I don't eat beef and they were made with brisket but those chicken meatballs with polenta smack your lips amazing!! The meatballs were seasoned perfectly and so juicy man I was in heaven. We also ordered a bottle of wine which was amazing but I can't remember the name due to my bestie picked it out but they have an amazing wine list that is not mentioned on the website but its awesome. We them ordered the margherita pizza and boy oh boy amazing is an understatement because it literally was the best margherita pizza I have had in Atlanta, I'm drooling just thinking about it. The sauce was perfect and the dough was just delicious!!! We finished off with pasta, I had the Pappardelle which was knock your socks off fresh and the mushrooms it was pure perfection not a lot of sauce but enough to coat the noodles and you can definitely taste the freshness of the pasta and my bestie had the cannelloni which she said was amazing. We absoluted our meal and enjoyed our time at Double Zero and will definitely be back. The atmosphere was great, nice decor and very friendly and attentive staff. The parking situation just an FYI they do have valet but it was full at 7:30 on a Saturday night but I found free street parking. I wish I could give 10 stars because they definitely exceeded my expectations!!!!!",

        "text": "I've been here twice; the first time soon after it opened. I really liked it. I don't go back to many restaurants because there are so many to try, but I've gone back here. It also helps that I was able to get reservations on short notice. \n\nMany restaurants these days create an ambience by creating noise. Double Zero has some noise but it's possible to have a conversation without yelling even with the tables that are a little long (the better for ordering more food). The first time I went our server was super friendly but his nails were really dirty, almost as if he worked in a garage during the day. At my second visit we had two proper servers and a trainee. They were just okay and actually seemed a little rushed. Less personable.\n\nThe funghi pizza is really, really good. I've ordered it twice. It has a nice mushroom sort of cream sauce as its base. It's very light though with a very intense mushroom flavor. The mushrooms on the pizza are beyond button and also very flavorful. The pizza is drizzled with some light lettuces. The first time there was a hint of lemon on the lettuces adding a nice surprise to a bite. \n\nThe polenta has chicken broth in it but the chef was able to make it vegetarian for me. This always makes me like a place more. I had it the first time I went and if I recall correctly it was good but not amazing. The broccoli was surprisingly good while the take on burrata was good but a bit small. My friend really liked the meatballs. For some reason I ordered the artichoke tip during my second visit. I think I got stuck on the idea of artichokes even after I learned it was just an artichoke dip. For what it's worth, I really enjoyed it and while it may or may not have had a ton of calories, it didn't feel too heavy. \n\nUnlike, say Barcelona, which gives really small small plates, the servings here are a good size.",

I would still return but maybe next time I'll ask to taste the tomato sauce before they make me my pizza!",

While I did miss some of the old menu items, the brisket arancini was melt in your mouth amazing! \n\nWe noshed on a few small plates and shared a bottle of wine. They have a good assortment at very reasonable restaurant prices. Both of the Tempranillos on the menu were solid. \n\nThe new bar setup looks awesome, and supposedly they do a lot of tastings there now. Will definitely have to check this out as they had out of this world amazing cocktails at the Roswell Rd location. I can only assume they're just as good in Decatur. \n\nParking is a little confusing since this is in Emory village. There is street parking available and parking behind the building. I believe it's valet only on busier nights, so bring cash just in case.",

        "text": "I am legit loving this place. I've been there twice in the past month, and just loved every moment. The drinks are very creative (if you're nice, you can even ask the bar lead to make you a custom drink based on the liquor of your choice as well as undertones you desire). Food is delicious - super fresh (quite a refreshing contrast with the typical Atlantan food!). Their pasta is made in-house as well as their pizza. Just 10s all across the board for me. Most importantly, as a native New Yorker, I pride myself on knowing a good slice of pizza. Their pizza is not your typical NY slice but definitely a more traditional take of an authentic Italian slice (cue hand talk) ... But really, the last time I had pizza this good was in Naples. Slightly burnt in the ferrara oven .. MmmmMm. What are you waiting for? Go already!",
