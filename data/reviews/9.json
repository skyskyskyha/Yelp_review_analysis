Luckily, I was able to find street parking across the street (Glen Iris).\n\nThis place is deceiving from the outside, but don't let that fool you. The service, food and drinks were absolutely tasty. \n\nThe restaurant is quite small, but does have a bar. Service was overall great. After ordering, it felt like every dish came out within minutes. \n\nI would totally come back here for the scallops alone! nom nom",

        "text": "A warm yet inviting & upscale Asian fusion restaurant, with a super friendly atmosphere & stylish Oriental decor. The seating options vary from the main dining area with booths & tables to the spacious bar & private dining upstairs. \n\nWe didn't have reservations yet were able to sit at the bar. Kevin, our Bartender/Server extended us such amazing & engaging service during our first visit here. All the staff we encountered offered the same welcoming service. \n\nThe food menu offers shareable selections providing a great way to try different dishes.\n\nThe Vegan options are plenty (about 6-7 offerings) - I had an order of Spring Rolls to hold me over. My Brother had the Basil Chicken in a garlic & lightly sweet sauce & puff rice. \n\nThe curated menu of libations includes unique cocktails & a few high-quality wines & beers. They offer Half-off Bottle of Wines on Mondays. Overall the menus had a flexible price point, especially for a small party of 2-3. \n\nReservations are limited to 90 minutes & the patio tables are limited to 2-4 guests. Street parking or Valet for $5 which is located in the parking garage next door.\n\n*Service: 5/5\n*Menu: 4/5 \n*Taste: 4/5\n*Portion: 5/5\n*Price: 4/5\n*Atmosphere: 5/5\n*Overall Experience: 5/5",

        "text": "I liked this place a lot! I came here on a rainy Friday night with my friends who are local and it took us a minute to find the door... We walked past it 3 times - it was very non-descript. \n\nWe were seated upstairs and our server grabbed our drink orders. I was starving so obviously I wanted to order the whole menu. Service was a tad slow as our server was serving both upstairs and down. \n\nI started with a mocktail- The Butterfly effect and that was delicious. I tried the Cranberry boss and hated that. It was awful. My friend got a few cocktails and enjoyed his. \n\nFor food:\nPeking duck buns - good! The bun was soft and the duck was cooked well. Didn't have skin though. \nMiso soup - meh - don't get this\nSeared scallops - Scallops were decent sized. Overly salty \nRoasted bone marrow - I LOVE bone marrow and this was delicious\nSalt and pepper tofu - mid\nMiso eggplant dip - my friend's favorite of the night\nRoti canai - soft roti with dip, very good\nShoyu tomago - it was okay? \nCacio pepe - I did not like this but my friend did \nPork Kimchi Fried Rice - I liked it but it came out so late that I didn't have stomach for it anymore\nGreen beans - SO good. I ate it all within 2 minutes of it being put down \nMango sticky rice - I love mango sticky rice, but I really don't like it when they put mango sorbet on top vs fresh mango. Did not like. \nPanna cotta\n\nI think prices are pretty okay and I definitely enjoyed my meal!",

        "text": "This restaurant has valet for only five dollars so you do not have to circle the block attempting to find a parking space. When you walk towards the restaurant after parking, you will notice beautiful Chinese paper lanterns and the outdoor eating area. The moment you walk through the blue door you will feel enchanted by the long velvet drapes and the warm pink lighting. The host was extremely kind and welcoming and I was seated right away. \n\nI think I was matched with the best waitress on their staff, Ashley. She was so knowledgeable about the menu items and described them accurately. The service is exceptional and the food is mouth watering and delicious. Every single dish I ate I literally closed my eyes and sighed because it was just that good. The squash soup is like a warm autumn hug and the roti canai had the right amount of spicy notes. The roti arrives warm, buttery with a slight crisp and pairs well with the red curry chicken and potatoes.  Every dish is shareable and the portions allow you to select multiple dishes before feeling too full.  This restaurant is a gem and is now going to be placed on my top ten list. The entire experience was phenomenal, so don't sleep on this place make reservations right away because space is limited.",

        "text": "I really really like this upscale Asian fusion restaurant. It is perfect for an intimate date night out. The ambiance is very intimate and posh, with very tasteful oriental decor. The drinks were good, they have a curated selection of unique cocktails. We got a couple drinks that were pretty good, kind of strong.\n\nFor the food, they do sharable style where you can order small plates. You are able to order a variety of dishes to try, and the prices are very reasonable for 2 people. We got the tamago, cacio e pepe, brussel sprouts, miso eggplant dip, and basil chicken. Really impressed with the tamago egg dish. It has really good flavor and good texture with the crispy rice. Our two other favorites were the basil chicken and the cacio e pepe. The basil chicken had a nice crispy texture on the chicken while still flavorful with basil and onion. The consistency of the cacio e pepe noodles were fantastic and chewy, it reminded me of Italy.\n\nLastly we had the Panna Cotta dessert. The yuzu flavor on top really adds a nice tart flavor to the vanilla cream base.\n\nI really really recommend this place for a date night!",

        "text": "Came in on a Friday night. I couldn't figure out where to park even though there's a big sign on the building for Ruby Chow's that says parking. After circling the block a couple times a spot opened up on the street a few feet from the entrance. I was also a bit confused on where the front door was because there wasn't a sign like there is on the side that says to go around to the other door. Felt very speakeasy-ish. There looked to be an upstairs but I don't think they were allowing people up there. The downstairs is fairly small but the stylish Oriental decor was very cute and the roar of conversations gave good energy. We were initially sat at a 2 seater table but their tables are too close together for my taste so we sat at the bar. The bartender Ayana (spelling??) was so cool and friendly. We wanted to try a bunch of things since there are several shareable options lol but we settled on the duck and pork steamed buns, the kimchi pork fried rice and the Shaking beef. All were so delicious. Out of the duck and pork steamed buns I liked the pork the most. It reminds me of a pork schnitzel. The fried rice was one of the best I've ever had and the shaking beef was very tender and flavorful. Decent prices for 2 people I think. The manager walked around greeting people. I forgot his name but he was so welcoming and accommodating to us.  I'll be spreading the word about this spot!!",

My friend and I visited on an early Wednesday evening. We did have reservations, which I highly recommend, as it gets pretty busy and the place is small. \nThis place specializes in Asian Fusion (mostly Thai and Chinese) cuisine and serves dishes tapas style. My friend and I ordered about 6 dishes to share, which were were all amazing! While I didn't get pictures of everything, I most remember the duck bao buns, garlic green beans, and walnut shrimp. I absolutely cannot wait to try more dishes when I return!",

Not very soupy. Worth sharing. \n\nShoyu tomago: flavor flavor texture texture!\nPow pow shrimp: smaller portion but the taste is worth it\n\nSalt and pepper tofu: yall, talk about five spice. This was crunchy, sweet, umami deliciousness with a kick. \n\nKimchi rice: a huge portion and huge kick of flavor. \nI would order all of these items again, but I would want to try more. \n\nPrice: menu ranges tapa style from $6-$17; honestly for the price and portion it aligns well with Asian fusion elevated equivalents. \n\nParking: be advised there is a valet on the back side of the complex and it's approx the same price as self park.

We were upstairs which was cute but I wish I could've seen the whole place.\n\nMy fiancée and I both loved our mocktails. We ordered a variety of dishes, including the cacio and Pepe noodles, Brussels sprouts, duck bun, miso soup, pork belly & grits, and roti canai. This was plenty to get us full, I would recommend maybe 2-3 plates per person. We also shared mango sticky rice which left us SO full. We wish we would have had a bit more guidance on the ordering.\n\nEverything was really good, but took a while. My favorite was the pork belly, or maybe the brussels sprouts. The service was good but perhaps not exquisite. We did valet parking.",

The staff offered us menus & beverages. Very attentive. \n\nSmall plates to share - yes please. You'd assume the portions are too little, but you'll get FULL very quickly. We had the Pork belly & grits, Green Beans, Wonton, Roti w/ chicken, Peking beef (Togo) & Mango sticky rice. My food was so good that I ordered more green beans togo. Also, my server suggested a great Passionfruit limeade as I'm pregnant & can't drink alcohol. \n\nI do not know the price point.

Everything has satisfying flavors that make you want to continue eating forever: crunchy rolls, savory noodles, flaky flatbreads, and rich creamy soups. Umami flavor is center stage here. The Cacio E Pepe was a standout dish and one of the best examples of the benefits you can achieve by mixing culinary cultures. \n\nIf you are interested in tasting thoughtful zero proof drinks, this is the place for you. They offer a wide selection of specialty drinks that are fruity and herbal.\n\nThe layout of this restaurant is very unique. You walk in through velvet curtains and you already feel somewhere special. It is dimly lit with a regal ruby color palette. There is a cozy upstairs section as well. If you are looking to dine outdoors, there are heaters and beautiful Chinese lanterns hanging above you. At night, this is quite a sight. \n\nLocated close to PCM, you can park on nearby streets or in the adjacent parking deck. It's a very lively area. I would recommend reservations here unless you get there when they open.\n\nAt the end, the bill was served with a delicious frozen grape and a beautiful flower centerpiece. It was the happiest bill I've ever received! I would come back here many times again.",

        "text": "We came here for a friends birthday there was about 20 of us. I was little skeptical about coming. My expectations were low due to it being an upscale Chinese restaurant but boy ol boy, let me tell you ..... it BLEW MY MIND!! \n\nMy friend made reservations and we were seated somewhat in a private area upstairs. It was a very cute place, soft music, low lighting, perfect atmosphere and the staffs were wonderful!! Definitely a Great place for date night. \n\nMind you I already had low expectations coming here so I didn't care to look up the menu before coming... it's Tapas style menu and none of didn't know what to order so we all started on drinks first. After a few shots in the birthday girl said to the waiter, \" we would like two orders of every thing please \"  \n\nThe food came out pretty quick. The first thing that came out was the roasted bone marrow and let me tell you, my low expectations change so quick!!! That bone marrow was sooooo delicious!!! I was so excited to try the rest of the dishes. I didn't get to take a picture of all the food but I sure will tell you that EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD!!! Taught me real quick to not judge a book by it cover.",

It was the first time in my entire life I'd been asked to leave a restaurant because a party was waiting (there were empty tables nearby). We weren't asked to transition to the bar area - just leave. \"sorry friends, but we have some guests waiting for this table...\" Interestingly, one of the folks in our party left an item at the table and had to go inside to get it a few minutes later. Of course, there were no guests seated or waiting LOL. When I called the manager he stood by the employee and swore people were waiting to be seated there. It was very odd. Service is significantly better at the bar. Food is good and prices are reasonable, but plates are small (enough to share with one other person).",

        "text": "Such a cute place! I remember when this space was a sushi restaurant but it looks nothing like it did before, kudos on the interior design! This is a great spot for a date or for a girl's night. The restaurant is intimately  dimmed and romantic. I took my bestie here for her bday. \n\nNow the food. So many yummy tapa dishes to choose from, and our waiter did a superb job describing the dishes. It was a tough decision but we went with the pork belly fried rice, bone marrow, green beans and the walnut shrimp. My friend also had the miso soup. Everything was so tasty! My first time having bone marrow and it was super buttery and flavorful but one of the ends of the larger bones was red which looked a little raw so we didn't eat that part. \n\nThe bartender was amazing! Craft cocktails only here, we had lavender margaritas and they were a hit! Nicely balanced. \n\nBathrooms were clean, service was great. Parking is available in the parking deck, I think it was $5. \n\nI will definitely be back!!!",

Had I known that the restaurant itself would be so pretty I would have eaten in instead of ordering takeout! Regardless, the food was really good -- I got the roti canal which I absolutely loved and would get over and over again. I also got the spicy pork noodle which was an interesting fusion of asian and italian noodles with the pork ragu. Some other doses on the menu looked very exciting so I am definitely going back here one day to try out some new things!",

Cute Asian restaurant that specializes in small plates & intimate dining. \n\nParking: $3 validated valet parking\n\nFood: Amazing. We enjoyed the Garlic Noodles, General Tso's Chicken & both Shrimp offerings. The Walnut Shrimp was the highlight of them all. Think Bang Bang shrimp. The portions are small since they are small plates so keep this in mind.\n\nDrinks: The margarita was tasty, but a little too sweet for me. I ended up ordering the After Hours cocktail, which was like an old fashioned & very good.\n\nService: Very attentive, friendly service from all the staff I encountered. Our waitress was so sweet & gave us a complimentary new ice cream for my partner's birthday.\n\nOverall, this was a great experience. I'm looking forward to visiting in the colder months. I hear they offer outdoor seating in Igloos!",

We walked in as a party of 3 on Saturday night and we definitely should have made reservations. We were able to luckily get a seat at the bar. \n\nWe sat down and ordered drinks. I got the cocktail with the empress gin and it was tasty! For the mains, we got a bunch of different options and they were all amazing! The dumplings were delicious and one of my faves and have to admit the cacio e pepe pasta was delicious. This is for sure a unique menu and everything is delicious. The vibes of this restaurant are great to and I look forward to going back reservations and trying some of their main entrees versus the tapas style. Great job to Ruby Chow's and a great recommendation!",

So happy I finally had a chance to try out this place with a few friends. \n\nFirst, they do have valet parking located behind the restaurant and it's $5.00. No need to stress about Peking on the street or over at Ponce City Market.\n\nUpon arriving, as you walk by their outdoor seating and walk through the entrance doors you are transported to a very cool 70s/80s Asian lounge complete with old school Chinese mats with the Chinese Zodiac.\n\nThe menu is interesting and has a fusion of many Asian dishes...Chinese, Thai, Indian, etc and even Italian! We decided as a group to try all of their buns (duck, pork and soft shelled crab) and each one of us select two small plates to share. In the end we got: kimchi fried rice, green beans, wontons, bang bang shrimp, shaking beef, fried oysters, roti canai, basil chicken, chicken confit, crispy rolls, salt and pepper tofu. All of it was tasty...you seriously cannot go wrong with anything in the menu!\n\nFor dessert we got the mango sticky rice and the chocolate pot au crème which were just ok.\n\nWe left happy, full and wanting to come back again! Can't say that about most places! Highly recommend if you haven't had the chance!",

        "text": "Ambiance 5/5 - it's beautiful inside! sexy, colorful, feels upscale and sophisticated and you won't feel crazy if you always overdress how I do. The velvet seats and the art work at a little extra something that really makes you forget you're on Ponce Ave. \nParking: Pull into the parking lot and use the valet service. Ruby Chow does validate it, but it only takes a few $ off. I hate paying for parking and think it's an abomination but this is the only part of the night I didn't enjoy, so I'm not really trippinggggg. \nService: Our waitress was very attentive. She knew the menu inside and out, was able to recommend/not recommend things to us and even encouraged us to order less (because we were being greedy lol). Food came out fresh, beautifully plates and quck!\nFood: I met a friend here and we shared everything. We got: \nPeking dduck buns: dduck is one of my fav things to eat and this buns did not dissappint. The bun itseld was chewy, soft and fluffy (sinks into your teeth) and the cucumber, hoisin and star anise jus was the perfect accompaniment to the fatty dduck (why won't my keyboard let me type dduck without automatically replacing the \"d\" for an \"f?!\" do i really cuss that much? I guess the proof is in the keyboard auto correct pudding. \nWalnut shrimp: delightful! Creamy, savory, umami packed and the shrimp was buttery and soft. Wasn't spicy at all to me, though. \nBrussel sprouts: the puffed rice went really well with the spouts and puree. They were really well seasoned, not bitter and the perfect amount of crisp. \nShoyu Tomago: The star of the show. I would have eaten 12 of these if I could. The most delicious, sexy, beautiful egg I've ever consumed. The rice cake really took it up three notches. I would go back again JUST to get this egg. \nSzechuan Green beans: one of my fav ways to eat green beans and this did not disappoint. Perfect amount of crispy/char and the sweet glaze was a nice compliment to the salty. \nSalt and pepper tofu: I get this at any restaurant that has it on the menu and this is by far one of the best I've had in the atlanta area. \nCacio & Pepe: Not what I was expecting but in a good way. It was SO good. The szechuan gave it a nice layered profile. Wish it was more spicy but I tend to have an insatiable spice meter so maybe I'm the toxic one here. \nDessert: We got the chocolate thingy with miso. Chocolate, sesame and miso is an undefeated mix and it hit every taste bud there is to hit. Really satisfying and comforting way to end a meal. \n\nThe cocktails are delightful and very sexy - from the ingredients to the presentation. I got a mocktail with lychee. It was refreshing and perfect for the summer heat. \n\n I will absolutely be back!",

        "text": "This might be my favorite restaurant I've tried recently in Atlanta!! My friends and I walked in on a Saturday evening for dinner before a concert. We were able to get seated at the bar since it was just 3 of us but you DEFINITELY should get reservations. Parking also is a little tricky - you'll need to park in a Parkmobile zone, Ponce City Market and walk, or residential and walk. \n\nService was excellent, everything came really fast like within 5-10 minutes of ordering! We got the Basil Chicken, Cacio E Pepe, Dumplings, Pow Pow Shrimp, and Fried Oysters. I also had the GBS (Ginger-Bourbon Sour). My drink was so tasty and just the right amount of ginger to play off the bourbon. The food was also incredibly tasty, we liked every single dish!! I think the pow pow shrimp, dumplings, and cacio e pepe has to be my favorite. There was plenty of food and we were able to finish dinner so quickly and be on time for our concert!\n\nOverall, 10/10 recommend Ruby Chows, especially for a nice dinner (make sure to get reservations)!",

Our waitress checked up on us often enough and was friendly. The vibe in the restaurant is moody with Asian-floral-inspired wallpaper. Bar was lively! \n\n(If you are coming from the Bay Area or grew up with abundance of Chinese/Asian-fusion food, I would recommend trying more local-Atlanta food).",

I wasn't the biggest fan of the spicy pork noodle, the fusion of italian and asian threw me off a little. Shaking Beef had really good texture and flavor, definitely one of the smaller dishes. My least favorite dish was the Basil Chicken. It had a kind of minty/licorice after-taste that I did not particularly like.\n\nOverall, a really nice place to go to with a great staff and atmosphere.

        "text": "I visited Ruby Chow's for dinner on a Friday night and had a good experience. We really enjoyed some of our plates and had friendly service service, so I'd definitely visit again to explore more of the menu.\n\nSome of our plates were exciting and delicious, and others were just okay, but nothing was bad. My favorite dishes were the Chengdu Brussels sprouts and the katsu bun. The Brussels sprouts were a good level of crispness and had excellent sauces and seasonings throughout; the plate comes with a generous portion that we enjoyed throughout the meal. The katsu bun is soft on the outside and crispy and saucy on the inside with the perfect level of spice. In my opinion, our other dishes (the wontons, pork belly & grits, duck bun, and panna cotta) were just okay; they were well-prepped but didn't taste as flavorful or interesting. I enjoyed being able to share and sample a variety of small plates, and the food seemed appropriately priced.\n\nWe had good service throughout the meal. The hostess and our server were both very friendly and welcoming. The server gave direct and honest recommendations (which turned out to be on-point) which we really appreciated. We dined outside since I secured the reservation only ~24hrs in advance and that was the only space available. It was definitely a cold night so we wore out jackets most of the time, but they had heaters by the cluster of outdoor tables which helped. The outdoor space is covered overhead, so I imagine it's fine in the rain as well, but I'd recommend trying to get a table indoors if it's a particularly cold night.",
