        "text": "I came here for brunch on one of the \"Atlanta Snow Days\" that happened last week. There is a parking in a garage around the corner, which always makes me feel better because I don't have to stress about finding a spot when my stomach is eating itself.\n\nThe decor and vibe is very hip and modern, almost hipster-ish, which is right up my alley!\n\nI arrived before my party and ordered a chamomile tea and was pleased with the set up that included a small tea pot and lemon wedges and honey per my request. Really good tea by the way. My friend ordered orange juice, which came in a large sized glass, and my other ordered the unlimited coffee that is an option if you dine in.\n\nNow to the food. YUM.\nI ordered the fried chicken biscuit that was smothered in tomato gravy. It was good, but I was hoping the chicken would be a bit more seasoned. There was bacon on it which added to the flavor, but when I return, I'll be exploring other option. I also ordered some grits on the side, but wasn't tall that impressed. I don't think I'm a grits type of gal!\n\nMy friend ordered the black bean cake and eggs, and WOW. Who knew black beans could have so much flavor and work with eggs?? I deff want this next time around.\nMy third fiend ordered the shrimp and grits and she was very pleased!\n\nWhen our food got to the table, it wasn't as hot as we wanted. The waitress was very nice and warmed up our food without any issues and was very apologetic. \n\nEach of payed less than $20 for our orders and left satisfied. I will be back!",

        "text": "So I got around to trying west egg cafe and I'm so glad that I did. I went with a group of friends for Sunday brunch because we were celebrating our friends recent engagement. \n\nWest egg cafe like most brunch restaurants do not accept reservations, so more than likely you need to prepare yourself for a long wait. I believe our party had to wait about about 90 min. \n\nWhen were finally seated, our party got a pitcher of mimosa which were okay as far as mimosas go. \nOur server was pretty attentive and we didn't have to wait too long for the food which is great considering how packed the restaurant was. \n\nI ordered the churro waffles and sausage and the Georgia Benedict. The churro waffles were just as amazing as I imagined. A crispy waffle covered in sugar and rich chocolate sauce. So decadent. The Georgia Benedict was good as well. I always like poached eggs and the turkey sausage was pretty decent as well.",

        "text": "Loveeeee West Egg for brunch and that's why we keep coming back! I'll be honest, the long wait here is the biggest downside (2 hr waits, really?) and the reason why half the time I try to go here I end up leaving. But there are some awesome things about this place!\n\nThoughts and Recommendations:\n- Favorite Dishes: the Fried Chicken Hash is a large portion and so flavorful, the Pimento Cheese and Bacon Omelette is just a classic easy choice, The Georgia Benedict is another classic you can't go wrong, and the Challah French Toast is large portion and if you have a sweet tooth you'll love it. \n- Good Coffee: I've said this in other reviews- good coffee is a great indicator of a solid restaurant and West Egg is no exception. I usually order the drip coffee and it's consistently brewed fresh. \n- Friendly service: I love how warm and friendly the staff is every time. They servers check on the table often, refill our drinks without having to ask, and are just very helpful and quick if we need anything. \n- Photobooth: Not many places have a photobooth and I love West Egg for having one. It's a fun way to capture memories- especially if you're here celebrating a big day or catching up with a good friend. Last time I took pics (like 4 years ago) it only accepted cash- but I'm not sure if that's still the case.\n\nOverall, West Egg is a great brunch spot if you're not starving and time to  wait. The food is delicious and affordable, and the parking situation isn't too bad (rare in Atlanta). Just park int he parking deck in the back and follow the signs to West Egg. I hope this review helps!",

It took a little while for our coffees to come (which is why I deducted one star), and the coffee was not hot when we got it. \n\nFood: 5 stars. I loved my tofu scramble. It came perfect with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were well seasoned too, so not much sauce was needed. \n\nService: Our waitress was very friendly and got us everything we needed. No complaints there.\n\nParking: There is free parking in the garage right behind the restaurant.. you have to look for it otherwise you might miss it.\n\nAmbiance: I like the interior of this place too. It's loud so it's hard to have an intimate conversation (especially since the tables are so close together) but definitely a lively brunch place. \n\nI really like this place but I'm always reluctant to come here due to the wait. 1 hour is actually not so bad for this place... (a lot of times it is longer) but it's just too much if you are hungry and there are plenty of other good options.",

It's the first time in a very very very long time that I actually left half of my breakfast on the plate.  \n\nI ordered one of the build-your-own omelets, truly an impressive quantity of food - three eggs, choice of fillings, potatoes, and a biscuit. The omelet was incredibly greasy, with that greasy taste being front-and-center with every bite - and I knew after the first bite that I wouldn't be finishing the omelet. The potatoes were crispy (the way I like them) but lukewarm, and the biscuit was just okay.  \n\nOn the positive side, the staff here is quite friendly, making sure my coffee cup was full at all times and that I had what I needed. \n\nUnless you're already in the Westside Provisions part of town, it's not worth the Uber ride over - and even if you are, I'd suggest searching down other options.",

West Egg Cafe is your go to brunch locations.\n\nEvery other restaurant in the West Side Provisions district is pretty pricey. They have a wide variety of options on their menu as well.\n\nCons: very popular brunch location in Atlanta, long waits on the weekend. Highly recommend reservations made prior :)",

There's free parking in the Westside Provisions deck and there's a walkway on the 1st level that leads out to the shops and restaurants. \n\nI walked in on a Sunday morning, the place was packed. I could barely see the hostess stand! I asked her if the bar was first come first served and she said yes. I gladly sat right down. \n\nThe server was super nice and I decided to order the Westside Pile Up- skillet potatoes topped with onions, peppers, cheddar cheese, bacon, two eggs. I subbed the bacon for 2 turkey sausage patties. I added spinach and changed the eggs for egg whites. That added about $2 on to my total unbeknownst to me. I ordered the peppermint tea as well with honey and lemon. \n\nIt was a pretty good meal. The potatoes were a little tough but I did enjoy the meal. It was a farm to table style meal. I paid around $20 including tip which was a little pricey but you're honestly paying for the ambiance as well. It's a nice place to bring someone if their visiting!",

The place was clean and very popping - seems to be popular with the locals!\n\nService: 10/10. Our waitress was prompt to check on our table throughout the meal and was very willing to help answer questions about the menu. Didn't have to wait for a table and food came out quickly.\n\nFood: 10/10. I ordered the tofu scramble and it was so much more food than what I was expecting. Highlight of the dish: lots of veggies and the vegetarian sausage was so tasty!! My friend ordered an omelet and it was also very good. The roasted potatoes on the side were delicious as well.\n\nDrink: 10/10. We tried the spicy hot chocolate and it indeed had a kick to it. Don't think I'd normally prefer my hot cocoa to be spicy but it ended up growing on me! Wish I took a picture of the cute foam layer on top when it just came out.\n\nOverall, really enjoyed this place and it has a lot of relatively healthy breakfast options!",

        "text": "NOTE: Late, pre-COVID review! \n\nYou have to accept the fact you're going to be waiting for a table, but I really think it's worth it! We got lucky and only waited maybe 40 minutes on an early Saturday afternoon. \n\nThe menu is pretty much brunch all day, every day, but they have a separate specials menu on the table. That's what I ordered from & got the lemon curd & blueberry compote pancakes. I like sweet & savory for brunch, so I also ordered a side of potatoes. Well, obviously that was a mistake when the server came with my food. Literally, my reaction was \"holy crap, those are huge pancakes!\" It was the entire size of the plate! So not only was I full after eating only half of it, I definitely did not need those potatoes. Both were still great as leftovers though! The lemon curd was tart but not too lip puckering, and paired well with the subtle sweetness of the blueberry compote. The pancakes themselves were thick and slightly fluffy. I just wish there was more curd to pancakes. I suppose that's what syrup is for though.",

        "text": "I came here for a solo dining experience after being recommended for brunch by an Emory alumnus. I came on a nondescript Thursday morning and it was about 75% occupied with plenty of servers. \n\nThe place looks much more hip/fancy than it actually is, so it definitely has positive vibes. The prices all seemed fair as well, so don't shy away if you're worried about breaking the bank. \n\nI was seated immediately and got a tea to start. Upon the server's suggestion, I got the Georgia Benedict - two poached eggs on sausages stop split biscuit, with sausage gravy on top. I chose potatoes as my side and got the garlic grits in addition (you get to choose one, but I wanted to try both). \n\nThe food took a while to arrive, but not exceptionally long (~15 minutes). The arrival was metaphorical for West Egg Cafe in its entirety - looks pretty, but full of fluff. Let's go item by item:\n\nGarlic Grits - soupy consistency, tasted like sweet corn, had too much granulation to it. \nPoached eggs - overcooked, hard in middle and did not run. \nSkillet Potatoes - not seasoned with anything other than salt, and not crispy enough. It definitely needed something extra like parsley, paprika, pepper - anything, for the love of God!\n\nI wasn't too upset because the food wasn't expensive, but for all its hype and aesthetic, I was expecting a lot more.",

At one point we couldn't find her so called someone else over but quickly stepped in to make sure our needs were met.\nMain reason for coming here...the churro Waffles.\nI must admit there were pretty good. \nThe only thing I didn't care for was the chocolate sauce. They say they switch it up I think either monthly or quarterly so I went with regular syrup & that was still just fine.\nThe bacon & potatoes were also very excellent.\nGranted this place does not offer bottomless mimosas but I was fine with making my own so I was in control of how much I was drinking.\nDefinitely coming back here soon!",

        "text": "So my hubby and I had friends in from out of town and they asked if we could pick a place in Buckhead to meet up for brunch. I was looking for a place that had the basic breakfast items for my \"traditional breakfast only\" husband and some more unique, elevated options for me. West Egg was it! \n\nParking was a bit of a headache. There is a big parking garage in the center, but I guess because of the time of day (Friday noon) it was packed. Thankfully, we found a spot. \n\nFrom the time we walked up to West Egg, there was such a cool, laid back vibe. Adirondack chairs out front for lounging. Cool staff. We sat on the patio. It was a breezy day, so they had the plastic panels open, allowing the breeze to flow through, aided by the ceiling fans out there. \n\nThe menu was great. It literally took me and the other lady in my party 15 minutes to decide because there were SO many delicious options! The two guys in our party were traditionalists, so they both went for the bacon, eggs, and pancakes. The sour cream pancakes were LEGIT, y'all. Fluffy and moist. They had just a hint of cinnamon in them that really set them off. However, the grits were the real all-stars. They were garlic grits and sooo good!\n\nI got the egg sandwich, which was also delicious - and huge. I asked for the tomato jam on the side, thinking it would be more like ketchup, but it was actually sweet like jelly. I slathered it all over my sandwich and dug in! The side salad with balsamic that came with it was the perfect accompaniment. \n\nAll in all, it was a great, laid back, cool and unhurried casual brunch experience. The service was slow, but fortunately, we were there to hang and weren't in a hurry. We topped off our visit by getting a slice of their beautiful caramel cake to go (I'd give it a 7 out of 10 stars). We keep talking about the place and can't wait to go back!!",

In the end, we decided to come to West Egg Caf√© instead. I found a free parking garage behind the restaurant and we were able to get a table immediately (came on Monday at 8 AM).\n\nChef Andrew Smith won the Jekyll Island Shrimp & Grits Festival's cooking competition back in 2016 and the winner of the cooking competition got an opportunity to cook the dish for the Governor of Georgia. The menu is pretty straightforward and about half of items come with either roasted garlic grits or biscuits. I order a cup of Earl Grey and it came in a small metal pot and was ready to drink - a thumb up on details (usually I just get a cup of hot water and a tea bag)!\n\n***\n\nGeorgia Benedict (turkey sausage patties, two eggs*, turkey sausage gravy over split biscuit, choice of roasted garlic grits or skillet potatoes - $10.50): Roasted garlic grit tasted pretty bland, but turkey sausage patties were flavorful and the combination between poached eggs, gravy, and biscuit was very good.\n\n***\n\nThis was the 2nd restaurant I visited in the South that actually gave out a postcard together with your receipt (this never happened in any of brunch places that I have been to in Los Angeles). It is a good all-around brunch place with Southern influence, but I wouldn't wait for more than a hour - so come during early weekdays to avoid the potential long wait!",

Well the wait was about an hour but it was Sunday at noon in Midtown so sounds about right.\n\nWhile we waited to be seated I had a milky way latte with soy milk, it was really good.\n\nAfter a while we were seated and waited on immediately. Of course we knew what we wanted and I got the same thing as last time the Chicken Chilaquiles minus the egg. I'm from New Mexico so anything that resembles Mexican food for breakfast reminds me of home and I'm definitely getting it. They were delicious, just be sure to ask for more Chilaquiles than salad because it's easy for them to pile it on and hid the fact that there isn't as much.\n\nMy brunch date got the fried chicken biscuit and he said it was delicious and the tomato gravy definitely added to the flavor everything blend together well.\n\nAnother one of my friends got the salmon cakes benedict, she liked them and the hollandaise sauce together, but the grits were really creamy and she didn't like that but overall it was good.\n\nOur waiter was funny, helpful, and attentive I would eat here again but I'd probably go a little earlier or later to avoid the crowd.",

        "text": "[Delayed review based on my experience on 5/10/19]\n\nMy mom, boyfriend, and I came here for breakfast on the day of my graduation. I chose this place because I often saw it on yelp whenever searching up breakfast & brunch places and it had good reviews. Sadly enough, we left very disappointed and I don't see myself going back.\n\nMy mom got the Belgian waffle and it was fine. She didn't particularly liked the level of cinnamon taste, but it was cooked fine.\n\nI got the shrimp & grits and it was the worst I've had. The only thing right on the plate was the shrimp, which wasn't overcooked. There was too much sauce which made it almost like soup. The grits were hardened and like jello and gummy. And as if it couldn't get any worse, the poached egg wasn't cooked properly. The egg white wasn't cooked all the way, so it was raw and clear. No one wants a runny egg white that looks like snot--yuck! Texture wise, everything except for the shrimp was very off-putting. The overall seasoning and flavor wasn't good either. Definitely the worst shrimp & grits.\n\nMy boyfriend got the Georgia Benedict and he thought it was just average. Nothing wrong with it but nothing special either. The potatoes didn't taste freshly made. They were hard and stale on the outside and lukewarm temperature on the inside. \n\nAll in all, a very disappointing meal, especially on a special day. Chefs need to improve!",

It was cinnamony and sweet, but not over done. I offered my friend a piece. At first, she did not want it bc she not a fan of oatmeal pies. She finally caved, and couldn't stop taking pieces. \n\nI ordered the short stack pancakes, turkey sausage and potatoes. I have zero complaints. None! Everything was absolutely delicious. Fluffy pancakes, perfectly fried potatoes and huge turkey sausage patties.

I had a very simple breakfast with eggs ham a biscuit and their garlic roasted grits. I did not get much of the garlic in the grits but they were teast I. I ordered my eggs over easy because I have found often times they are overcooked however this was not the case. To my surprise over easy today was way undercooked watery.

I liked the originality of the pineapple strawberry mimosa - since I'm used to the orange juice standard. The Fried Egg Sandwich was delicious, but it was a bit on the sweeter side - possibly because of the type of bread it was in. I recommend adding some hot sauce to it.  \n\nGiven their long waiting time, to do explore the area and return about 10-15 minutes prior to what your expected time is. That way, you are able to explore the many local stores nearby while working up an appetite. This is definitely a repeat location.",

The mimosa was strong and the punch was super sweet..too sweet really because my husband had to put water in it to finish drinking it.\n\nWe got the fried green tomatoes and they were so good. I set my expectations very high after this for our actual food selections. I got shrimp and grits and the hubs got fried chicken hash. \n\nMy shrimp and grits were good but nothing stellar or out of the normal. It looked really soupy but it did have flavor, but I do wish there were more grits. The sausage in the food was a little overcooked so they tasted a bit dry but with the juices on the plate it helped. \n\nThe chicken in the chicken hash was SO DRY it's like they cooked it on the stove then battered and fried it after it was already cooked enough. My husband doesn't like sending food back so he suffered through it and ate it. I tried it and was mad at him for not saying anything until I asked. But he did like the rest of the stuff that was in it. \n\nHe also got the sour cream pancakes and I tried those and they didn't taste spectacular nor any different than regular pancakes. \n\nOur server disappeared for a little bit and I wanted another mimosa but by the time she came back we were ready to go.",

Super nice guys. I had already paid and tipped and they were still super sweet to me. They could have easily just said, \"thank you\" and ignored me from there on out. Right?\n\nMy breakfast was the Fried Chicken Hash, it was delicious and the coffee was made well, served hot and the servers stayed on top of refills. I dream of my next visit to Atlanta.",

        "text": "Delicious! My husband and I came here because we wanted to kill a few hours before going to the airport and discovered this cute part of the city and thankfully West Egg Cafe! \n\nI ordered the Chicken Chilaquiles which were amazing and came with a packed plate of eggs, tortillas, chicken, and a healthy serving of avocado and sour cream. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits which were good (not the best I've had, but good). They had plenty of shrimp and sausage. Finally, my latte was delicious and came in a very large mug with a beautiful design. \n\nService was very quick and pleasant. I'd love to come back. \n\nMy only complaint was about the bathrooms. For such a cute place, I'd expect clean bathrooms, but they were dirty and wreaked of pee (and no soap).",

When I asked for management to help, the \"manager (short, Black male with short locs and a red Georgia crew neck shirt) was equally as rude.

        "text": "West Egg is a fine option for a buzzy brunch on Atlanta's West Side. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was packed. After being seated on their pleasant covered patio, we ordered from their excellent drink menu. She had the grapefruit and sage mimosa, which was fine, and I had their michelada, which was actually exceptional. I love a traditional michelada with a Mexican beer, but West Egg's used more of an IPA-style beer which gave it a nice, sweet flavor that counteracted the acidic tomato and lime juices. In addition, we ordered the London Fog. I am not much of a tea connoisseur, but I am glad we didn't  pass up this delicious and frothy steamed milk and lavender tea latte, which went exceptionally well with the rainy weather. For brunch, she had the cheese omelette, which was good, if not a little dry, although the potatoes were deliciously salted and crispy. I had the black bean cakes with eggs, which were good but also a bit dry and lacked the salsa and sour cream as the menu advertised. The service was friendly, but a little less attentive, as you could tell they were strained by the large crowd. All in all, while the food and service were a bit spotty, West Egg is a good spot in the neighborhood for good brunch drinks in a fun, lively atmosphere.",

Our first time here & we'll definitely be back. There is a oarking deck FREE of charge so that's definitely a PLUS!!\nHowever, the only con that I had was the wait  we waited 1 hour for a table and we had to keep going to the front desk to check on the time because 2 groups who arrived after us got seated first. Other than that we had a great time. The food, service, and atmosphere was bomb! Good job guys",
