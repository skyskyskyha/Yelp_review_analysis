Dined for an intimate birthday dinner and was disappointed that I didn't enjoy and couldn't finish a single course. Servings were inconsistent among my party - at one point we were unsure if they were the same entree because the fish had been prepared and plated so differently on each plate. The experience seem very amateur between preparation and service. I was incredibly unimpressed, especially having such high expectations for a restaurant like this.",

        "text": "One of my favorite restaurants. I've been celebrating special occasions here for many years. There are some picky eaters in my family, but there's something for everyone in the tasting menu selections. \n\nI remember when the tasting menu was only $75 for 5 courses. Now, it's about $110 per person for 4 courses. Inflation, I suppose! You actually get more than 4 courses since they bring out many treats on the side. I still highly recommend Bacchanalia. \n\nThe ambiance and service is great here. Parking is very convenient since they have their own lot. \n\nBacchanalia is located next to their sister shop Star Provisions so don't get confused if you enter from that entrance.",

        "text": "We came here for my birthday dinner and it was an experience. I have been wanting to come here for years and my husband and I went for my birthday. I will be honest and we thought we might not leave full with the small plates and had a plan b for after but it was not needed for we left food on the table and were full. \n\nFirst off if you don't know it's a 4 course menu and you pick all your courses up front and let the team pace them out for you. We had Denise as our server with a full staff supporting her. Let's say if you can choose a server I would choose her each and every time. She was friendly, knowledgeable, a foodie, timed everything well and always seemed to know when to check in with us. \n\nI wish I was a wine person for they have a sommelier who can help you pick wines based on what you have liked, or by region, types of grapes etc. We are cocktails people but if I want to explore wine I would be showing up here. \n\nI will post pictures of all our courses and please know besides the four courses you get amuse bouche to start with and with fun treats between or within your courses. They make bread fresh there as well and the sourdough and onion rye were amazing. I make sourdough, but now I want to see if I can make a rye onion roll loaf. \n\nNothing we had here was bad everything was excellent. We even went out of our comfort zone and had foie gras and duck. \n\nIf you want to explore food, have an excellent dinning experience, and just overall forget about the world and live in the moment, Come and dine here.",

The staff is knowledgeable , the ambiance is cozy, refined and appropriate for any type of occasion. If you are the type of person that truly enjoys gastronomy this is the place; however, remember that good quality and presentation is not cheap. The price per person -if you stick to the prefixed price- is not costly considering the variety of options your palate will enjoy in just one dinning experience; but, be careful getting too excited with the drinks and any other option out of the offer. Bottom line I enjoyed it very much and look forward on coming back! No pictures are posted of my dinner as I was too delighted with the food and made the decision to live the experience with all my senses and mind just focusing on my plates!",

Amazing. The experience from the time we arrived to the time we departed was simply perfect. The restaurant- exquisite. The service- exemplary. The ambiance- calm and exuberant, both at the same time.\n\nBut of course, you want to know about the food. The food! Amazing... simply amazing. They take the prix-fixe, tasting menu concept and truly do it justice. There wasn't a single dish that we didn't love. And that crab fritter... delictable.\n\nMaybe we were just missing truly gourmet cuisine after a long stint in Miami, or maybe this place really is that good.

        "text": "I came with a friend to Bacchanalia last weekend during my college homecoming. We got a reservation at 5 PM, right around the time they opened, and the restaurant was perfectly set up by the time we arrive.\n\nThe course menu is set up with a variety of options within each course, which offers some nice flexiblity. My friend is gluten-free and dairy-free, which significantly limited her options, so that is something to keep in mind. I am allergic to seafood, but there were still quite a few options available for me.\n\nFor the first course, the steak tartare was the largest potion of tartare I've ever had anywhere! It was rich & flavorful, so if you enjoy tartare, don't miss this dish. I enjoyed the dry aged NY strip for the second course. The triple creme during the third course was interesting, if almost a little overpowering for me. The apple dessert with brown butter was my favorite dish of them all.\n\nThe prix fixe price, compared to cities like DC and Boston, is a great value. The one item I'll note is that service was a little lacking--on multiple occasions, we had to flag someone down in order to get more water or wine. That said, the dining room is nicely appointed around a reasonably large central bar.\n\nI'd be happy to return to Bacchanalia.",

The creativity and attention to detail, combined with the relaxed and homey feel, is unlike anything I've eaten in Los Angeles or New York. Sophistication with no pretense. Excellent service. Reasonable prices. They also accommodated my gluten allergy flawlessly.\n\nOne more anecdote on how Bacchanalia (and Star Provisions) goes the extra mile for their customers--I left my gift to my fianc√©e at my seat when we left, and received a text that night that they have it and would keep it safe for me. With a flight the next day, I couldn't retrieve it within Bacchanalia's opening hours, so I went to their sister bakery in the morning to see if they could help. They couldn't access Bacchanalia, but they made me a free cappuccino for my troubles, which I appreciated very much. Later, I called the manager and they agreed to ship it to California for me right away. Bravo!",

        "text": "4 stars for a nice Atlanta restaurant.\n\nWhen it comes to Bacchanalia, I heard a pretty wide range of opinions. Some have told me that it is wildly overrated, while others have told me that it is now underrated. I wasn't sure who to believe about this Star Provisions-owned venue located over on Ellsworth Industrial Boulevard, so I decided to book myself a table early one evening to find out.\n\nI arrived at the venue, which is split between a store on the left when looking from the parking lot and the restaurant with a nice setup and pretty lighting on the right, and went inside to check in. I was invited to take a look at the store for a few minutes while my table was prepared. I came back over after looking around for a couple minutes and was led to my table. My server, who was a relatively young guy, did a very good job of providing solid service and answering questions. Like with some other nice Atlanta venues, Bacchanalia utilized various staff members to do things like bring out each menu item and even just be the bread guy (I really liked the bread guy). Aside from one issue that I'll discuss below, the service was overall what I would expect from a restaurant listed as a top 10 Atlanta spot in various lists.\n\nThe way it works here is you pay something like $115 dollars for a 4 course tasting menu. While that price for such few items alone could be a bit concerning, they also bring you little tasters in-between each course to give you a full meal experience. While I wasn't super full at the end of the meal, I had plenty to eat and walked away feeling like I received my money's worth. \n\nThe first thing I started off with was actually a holiday drink - their version of egg nog. I actually got the wine pairing to go with the tasting course (which is actually specific wines to specific selections, which is kind of nice). While the wines were fine, the egg nog was actually a really good drink to start off the meal.\n\nMy first items were (off menu) a few little little items (I think a radish was one of them) covered in an interesting butter. They were a little bland tasting, but I appreciated the effort and creativity. The first on menu item (which I ordered due to some pretty extensive Yelp research) was the crab fritter. The fritter was probably one of my favorite food items of the night as it came with citrus and avocado to make for a really fun food item.\n\nWhen it came to the next items, it actually took a little while for anything to arrive. A large party came in and seemed to take up everyone's attention (aside from the awesome bread guy). I get that big parties are important and profitable, but going about 30 minutes from first course to second course with zero waiter interaction was pretty annoying.\n\nMy second items that came out were (off menu) a moderately spice carrot dish with pumpkin seeds on top that was fun and (on menu) the guinea hen. In terms of the hen, the foie gras and endive that came along with it were great ideas that made for a really tasty and interesting dish.\n\nThe third items I had come out were (on menu) the Beecher's Flagship, which is a cheese dish that was suggested by the waiter. While I thought it was a little weird and unnecessary to have the main entre come out before the cheese/salad type of dish, it did work ok and the cheese dish was fairly tasty. The off menu dish that came out after it was some hot chocolate that was by far my favorite drink of the night and some of the best hot chocolate I've had in a while. I would drink a tall glass of that anytime.\n\nMy fourth and final dish that came out was the profiterole. I'm a pretty big fan of getting these at French restaurants, so I wanted to see how they would do. While the item generally tasted alright, the move to use maple instead of chocolate seemed like a bit of a misfire to me. A bold choice, but one that I don't think worked. It wasn't bad, but just not what I wanted to end my meal.\n\nOverall, Bacchanalia provided me with a good but not quite great restaurant experience. The pretty venue, solid service, and good food I think is enough to make this place actually pretty properly rated and at least worth checking out. Plus, they have a bar (why do nice venues not advertise this?), so that it another avenue to check this place out as well.",

        "text": "Great first time at Bacchanalia! For many many years I've been told the experience here is a must in Atlanta and my husband and I finally decided to come here to celebrate our 10 year dating anniversary. \n\nBacchanalia only offers a prix fixe menu consisting of a 4-courses. Wine pairings are optional for an additional cost. The dinner started with a 3 piece amuse- bouche which was truly delicious.\n\nNext, we experienced the fresh bread delivery? I've never seen this before where there is a staff member with a basket of fresh bread dedicated to servicing the tables. Very cool!\n\nFrom there our 4 courses began arriving. Our first course was probably our favorite! The Crab Cake and the Lobster Roll were so so so good! Highly recommend both of these options. The second course was a bit of a disappointment. I ordered the Salmon which was fine- it was cooked perfectly but there wasn't anything unique or special about the flavors here. My husband ordered the duck and unfortunately we had to send it back. We never send food back (emphasis on *never*) but the duck was inedible. I thought my husband was being dramatic but when I tried it it was all skin, incredibly chewy, and after chewing it for maybe 2 minutes I still had a hard time swallowing. I'm not sure why Bacchanalia would think eating a piece of duck like that would be possible or enjoyable but it was not. Learn from us- avoid the duck.\n\nThe rest of the courses were decent. Salads and desserts were delicious, unique, and were presented beautifully! Since we were celebrating an anniversary they brought us a complimentary small cake with a candle. Very thoughtful on their part. \n\nAt the end I ordered some coffee which was the second disappointment of the evening. It was brought out in a french press which was nice. Then I realized the coffee tasted far too strong to be made in a french press  and had coffee was murky with coffee grounds (not good filtration). So, I took a look at the coffee grounds in the press and they were far too small! It looked like coffee grounds for an espresso! If this place knew anything about making coffee they would know that coffee grounds need to be large for a french press. I was honestly shocked that a top tier restaurant would make a mistake like this.\n\nOverall, I now understand the fascination over the experience at Bacchanalia. The service is like none other. However, there was basic errors (objectively) and for that I deduct 1 star for my review.",

It is very expensive, but the way that the food was presented and the service was truly amazing. \n\nMy friends and I planned to have a large party, but they were initially unable to accommodate a party of 14 so we split into tables with staggered start times. However upon arrival the manager was able to pull some strings for us and we ended up getting the back section for our whole party to be able to sit together, which made the experience great from the get go. \n\nI believe the menu is seasonal. Everything I had was really great. I thought my cheese course was a bit heavy but everything else was great. I thought the crab fritter was one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life. \n\nThe duck was my second favorite. And the desserts were amazing as well. \n\nDefinitely worth the experience, but make sure you're saving up for it!",

        "text": "A lot of people will tell you this is the best restaurant in Atlanta, and it is certainly a great place to dine.  The place was made a little more famous but the 2017 movie Baby Driver when \"Baby\" played by Ansel Elgort is offers to take his girlfriend to Bacchanalia for dinner exclaiming that's \"it's the finest wine'ing and dining in all of Atlanta\"!  It's definitely a place you should try, but I've heard mixed reviews.  I don't think this is a reflection on the restaurant as much as widely varying expectations on the part of diners.  My recommendation, try and after work drink and an appetizer at the bar one evening and get a feel for the place, see if it's for you before you drop a few hundred on dinner...;).   Personally, I really enjoyed it and would go back.",

The service was great even we a little hiccup with hubby's entree not being warm enough. Everything was corrected right away and they were the perfect amount of attentive. \n\nThere were a few items that stood out on our menu that we enjoyed: \n\nCrab fritter: we both got this for our first course based on other reviews. It didn't disappoint. The outside was crispy and the accompanying sauce was delicious \n\nTurbot: my first time trying it. It's a nice light white fish. The caviar on top was a nice touch. The side of squash was nice as well. The size was also much larger that hubby's lamb. Between the two, the fish was the better choice. \n\nCheese course: The Pierre Robert was sweet and preps you for dessert. Hubby and I enjoyed his choice of the Red Cow Parmigiano. The cheese was thinly sliced with the most amazing warm date cake. We loved it. \n\nWe enjoyed our coffee and chocolate desserts.\n\nWe were doing dry January so didn't try their cocktails or wine but they have an extensive list and a sommelier to help you pick wine.",

        "text": "Bacchanalia is on my list of to-go places in Atlanta and we were so lucky to get a table of two for a Friday dinner. It's kind of far from Atlanta Downtown without subway so the transportation must be by cars. \n\nThe restaurant offers a 5-course Prix Fixe menu with surprising snacks between courses for $95 per person. There are 6 options under each course. After being seated and made our selections, we were served with the 1st snack, mini choux with cheese and various bread. Their bread was so addictive with chewy texture. \n\nEvery course was amazingly beautiful and delicate. My favorite was my first course, Foie Gras, which was creamy and perfect with bread. My husband loves his third course, New York Strip. The steak itself was well-grilled & tender and the sides were delicious & matched the protein so much. \n\nWe were satisfied and felt like royalty during the entire dining experience. Bacchanalia is definitely an ideal place for special occasions and we highly recommend it.",

        "text": "NICE PRIX FIXE MEAL WITH DECENT SERVICE!\n\ni made a reservation at bacchanalia for a Christmas present and it was absolutely lovely. the ambiance is pretty formal with a farmhouse/industrial vibe. it wasn't too crowded when we arrived for our 6:30 reservation and we were seated immediately (reservations are required). \n\n\nfood - 5/5\nthe food was outstanding. i had such a tough time choosing between dishes to get from each course since so many of them caught my eye. the menu changes regularly, but some items are pretty permanent. \n\nwe got the oysters to start and they were wonderful! they said that they get a shipment every day. \n\nfor my meal i got the crab fritter, marine lobster, Pierre robert, and chocolate. the crab fritter and marine lobster were outstanding. the seafood was so fresh and beautifully done. i wasn't a big fan or the pierre robert, i thought it was a little one dimensional and flat. the chocolate was good, but needed more ice cream in my opinion (probably wouldn't get it again). \n\nmy mom got the steak tartar, pasture raised lamb, chevre, and pecan. however, she originally ordered the souffle, but right before we were supposed to get the fourth course they said that they could not serve the souffle due to recipes issues. that was a big disappointment, especially since they notified us on such late notice. doesn't a souffle take a while, so wouldn't they have known earlier that they couldn't serve it? anyways she opted for the pecan instead and it was really good! i would get that over the chocolate. her other dishes were fabulous, the lamb was so tender and perfectly cooked. the chevre was vibrant (i liked it more than the pierre robert). \n\nservice - 4/5\nthe service was an area that was lacking for me, especially since it's such an expensive meal. for the most part, the waiters were really helpful, but a couple could have been a bit better. they frequently didn't refill the water glasses which was a bummer. and i am only making these harsher comments because it is one of the fancier restaurants in Atlanta. additionally, i tried taking photos and used a light and the manager came over to me and said i couldnt. im guessing the light was bothersome to the guests, which is totally understandable, but i was disappointed that i couldn't take pictures. \n\nother comments\n- parking: plenty of parking, big parking lot\n- extra food: the chef provides complimentary dishes in between some meals. it's a nice addition, but none of them were spectacular.",

Wasn't terribly impressed by the hostess and our first (albeit free) bites--a confusing dish with a slice of cucumber, radish, and wafer. They had my group thinking that the restaurant was trying too hard to be like a Michelin-star restaurant.\n\nHowever, as the night rolled on, we became more and more impressed by the food. Much of the menu was obscure and hard to understand, so we had to ask our waitress for her recommendations. But almost everything that we ate from there on out was delicious. I didn't always know what I was eating, which made the experience very fun and intriguing. Some standout dishes: the oysters, farmhouse egg (which is served like a dip), cheese courses, and chocolate molten cake.",

        "text": "Years ago, my hubby and I made a list (after lots of research) of the \"Best Restaurants in Atlanta\" that we wanted to visit and Bacchanalia kept coming up over and over again - so we were thrilled to finally take the time to visit for dinner service.\n\nDefinitely plan to make a reservation to eat here, they do have a generous bar space but it fills up quickly - there is very little room for walk-ins so you'll want a rezy (and make it several weeks in advance or else you'll end up eating at 5pm or 9pm) \n\nParking - they did not have valet and had plenty of self-service parking. \n\nLocation - they're tucked away behind Star Provisions on Ellsworth Industrial (you'll feel like you're lost or passed it, but it's literally on the back side of SP) \n\nAmbiance - LOVELY place! The decor, lighting, music, mood, etc was all exactly how I expected. They have a very generous bar space and great table seating. It was exactly the kind of ambiance you would expect for the price! \n\nService - wonderful service, the server was attentive in the correct amounts and allowed you plenty of time to enjoy your dish without making you feel rushed. They were great to answer all of your questions about the menu and the sommelier was great as well. \n\nThey allow you to bring your own wine bottle for a corking fee, I read online the corking fee was $25 which must have been very old because it was $50! That's definitely the highest corking fee I've ever experienced. They have a very extensive beverage list as well. \n\nNow on to the food....the food was good, however it always felt like it was missing a little something. In general it was good, but not excellent (which for $110 pp you expect excellence). My favorite dish was either the Crab Fritter or the NY Strip. For the bread service, go with the sourdough or the baguette. The lobster was lack luster, I had a few pieces that were a little fishy and I felt like it lacked the natural sweetness that lobster should have. The cheesecake is a nice finisher as well. In general I just felt like the food was missing a little something (seasoning, salt, etc), it was good but there was not much that absolutely knocked my socks off.",

        "text": "We have been wanting to go to this place and we were lucky to have a spot on a Friday night before our travel back to Augusta coming from our Miami flight. Given this is in Atlanta, we are happy that they have their own private parking lot and is free. They say it's business casual but people actually dress up here. Coming from the airport, we were definitely not that.\n\nAnyway, we were still given the best service. Although some reviews about this place says it's not kid friendly, i actually have my 5 y/o and they offered mac n cheese or chicken tenders for her. They also made sure that she's comfortable.\n\nThey have prix fixe menu where in you choose one dish from each of the four courses. The first course is an appetizer. We got the foie gras and crab fritter which are both AMAZING! We are very particular about the texture of our foie gras and they absolutely got it right here. The crab fritter is flavorful and texture is also so good. The second course is the main dish. Serving is slightly bigger. We love duck... and their duck did not disappoint. The maine lobster is something different. Not as flavorful as the previous dishes but still good. Third course - mostly cheese dishes except for the Leek. They gave us hot chocolate to cleanse our palate prior to our fourth course which is the dessert. We got the souffle and the strawberry which we also both liked.\n\nAlthough it's only a four course meal, the gifts from the chef plus the bread they offer (unlimited) will fill you up\n\nWe are hoping to come back when we visit Atlanta again in the future!",

However, Bacchanalia essentially met my high expectations.\n\nI came with a group of about 20 people for a corporate event, and we got to sit in a separate little dining area at a long table which was nice. We commented that the lighting only reaches about 2/3 of the table, so a few of us were left in the dark - but like, too dark to be in the \"romantic\" or \"fancy\" sense. \n\nI can say that the service was exquisite although I wish we could have had more individual choices for wine or cocktails. For the group, we just did a couple bottles of wine which were tasty but considering the price of everything, it would be nice to choose 1-2 drinks versus many refills of the same wine. \n\nFood was wonderful and I left very full - each course is small but there are many and also things interspersed, including a tasty bread basket. My favorite was the summerland farm egg with a runny yolk and unique spices as my starter. \n\nI think I will never quite feel comfortable at places this upscale, but I did really enjoy the food, service, and overall dining experience.",

We ordered champagne to start which was served in white wine glasses instead of champagne flutes. The sommelier insisted that they were champagne flutes - go figure! In terms of food, the best dish we had were the crab fritter appetizers. From there it was down hill. The entrees arrived at the table barely warm. We asked for them to be heated up and they came back the same - warm. The signature souffl√© desert was a soupy mess and over spiced. I'm sure people have good experiences there, but there are better in Atlanta where you don't have to break the bank.",

        "text": "I had high expectations for this place but was underwhelmed. I will start with the positives then move on to the negatives. \n\nPositives (+)\nBecause of its locations, there is ample parking and none of the valet hassle surrounding restaurants in tight lots around Atlanta. \nI also appreciated the architecture and interior design of the restaurant.But no one is here for parking and ambiance, so let's talk food. \n\nFood (+)\nI started with the Nantucket Bay Scallop and we were off to a great start! Very well seasoned and cooked, and the sauce it was paired with was delicious. Usually, scallop portions are quite small but I was not only surprised but appreciative of the amount of scallops on my plate. It was followed by the Pasture Raised Lamb, cooked medium and yet another great selection. I will also mention that others in my party got the Crab Fritter  (we will get back to that) for the first course and the Dry Aged New York Strip for their second course and I heard great things about these selections, too. As mentioned, we were off to a great start but the rest of the meal fell flat. \n\nNegatives (-)\nThey give you small snacks in between portions to fill in the gap between courses but all of these are a miss. An assortment of bread that has more misses than hits, very hard and crunchy (could do without), small bites of cucumber with garnishes, something else I can't remember because it was easily forgettable, etc.  All of these snacks leave you with one big question, how long before the next course comes to the table? The answer: FOREVER! The time between courses is immense (this could be because of the holidays but please come prepared with several conversation starters because there is much more talking than eating in the time you spend here. \n\nMoving on to the 3rd and 4th course, I chose Cheese and my partner chose Mushroom (I tasted my meals and theirs) and they were both okay. Nothing special. I could probably get a better selection of cheese at Kroger and the mushroom was overpowered by shallot and tarragon that you might forget there is mushroom on the plate. NOTE: This course also seemed a bit out of place, I would rather have the 3rd course before the 2nd course and after I finished my lamb go straight into 4th/dessert course, but that's neither here nor there. \n\nWhat was there, was an okay dessert. I had Pecan and my partner had Apple. Both were just okay. Nothing to rave about, nothing to remember. The big question: would I recommend? NO. Only because the highlights of the night didn't overrule the low points. Yes, I loved the scallop and the lamb but the amount of food I didn't care for doesn't make it worth the wait. If I wait 20 to 30 mins between courses I want to be blown away but instead, I continued to think about places I could've gotten a bigger portion of lamb. And to not leave anyone hanging, Bacchanalia is a sister company to W. H. Stiles Fish Camp in Ponce City Market and the same Crab Fritters are on the menu. If you enjoy steak, lamb and scallop, there are better options without all the fluff in between. Proceed with caution.",

        "text": "While by no means a terrible experience, I couldn't help but be disappointed. We came here expecting to be blown away but left feeling that we got robbed of our money.\n\nLet's start with the positive. The service is excellent. The staff are very friendly and very attentive. We had a late reservation on a Tuesday and when we left they gave us an entire loaf of sourdough bread they had leftover. The place also has a cool vibe and nice lighting. There's plenty of parking as well. \n\nThe bread. Love that they have a bread service. Wish the bread was better. The baguette was stale. The onion bread was good. The pretzel bread could was average. \n\nThe appetizers: we got the crab fritter and the hamachi. The crab fritter itself was quite good; a decent portion, and not too heavy with the batter but there was a little too much fish sauce/vinegar in my opinion. The yellowtail had potential but i felt that it wasn't marinated well enough and lacked some flavor of the sauce it was in. But still quite good. \n\nSecond course: the pasta and the lobster. The pasta agnolotti is delicious. No complaints at all. Good flavor and good portion. Likewise we were pleasantly surprised at the generosity of the lobster portion for the lobster dish. Downside was that pieces of lobster were still frozen inside. The accompanying sides of the lobster with the corn also felt very bland and thrown together. The chorizo in the dish was the sole contributing flavor. \n\nThird course: the least favorite part of the course. We got the triple creme and the Parmesan. I love cheeses and i love triple cremes but something was off. I almost think that the cheese was borderline turning. It was pungent but not in a good way in my opinion. The Parmesan was trying to be fancy but was just shaved Parmesan. I felt that this course was useless honestly lol \n\nAmuse-Bouches: in between some of the courses they gave you different tasters. The first was a cracker with smoked fish paste. The smoked fish paste was tasty but the cracker was so stale it was embarrassing. There was also a tomato tart which had a lot of potential but the dough was not cooked properly or had not risen in time to give the flakiness that a tomato tart deserves. There was a beet side that i tried a bite of but I'm not a fan of beets at all so i am biased in my dislike. \n\nDessert: the blueberry honey cake and the coffee feuilleutine. I was so excited to try the blueberry honey cake. I was disappointed to find that the blueberries were likely frozen. The \"croissant\" pieces were reminiscent of a hotel breakfast danish rather than a croissant and the gelato didn't taste like anything. There was so much potential for this cake. It felt like they had just taken the easy way out on the preparation. The coffee dessert was basically a bunch of ice coffee shaved ice and some coffee mousse. Enjoyed the mix of textures a lot but it was a bit too sweet. \n\nUnfortunately, fell quite short to my expectations and for the cost. Not worth the money at all and I'd say I'm unlikely to go again.",

        "text": "Corkage fee is now $50; was $25. Now, rarely see sweetbreads on the menu. No guarantee the night you show up they will have souffl√©s. \nAria corkage fee is $30, fair price. Given the slide at Bacchanalia, I will choose Aria much more often now.\nI always felt that Bacchanalia set the standard for food as well as corkage fee. I assumed that they recognized that many of their clients had wine cellars and that a fair corkage fee brought in these clients looking to pair food with their wines. It was the middle priced restaurants that tended to over charge on the corkage fee; like their clients were trying to cheat them out of wine profits. (Really? Are you a restaurant or a bar?) Bacchanalia's new $50 corkage fee sets a sad new standard.\n\nThis was previously my favorite restaurant in Atlanta and we ate there often. It's a sad decline.",

On the other hand, regretfully, there were some missteps with cooking and service. Some dishes were not perfect, and others were better. 2 of the dishes that were hot arrived and look warm and even cold. The worst was the baba in bourbon which came with no bourbon and hence was very dry. An attempt to say this to the waiter met with a shrug. Same problem with Madeleines that were clearly not fresh and dry. Maybe the restaurant should consider doing less and pay more attention to make the quality more uniform so all dishes are very good? It felt that they were over reaching vis a vie the capacity of the kitchen that may have made mistakes because they were stretched thin?",
