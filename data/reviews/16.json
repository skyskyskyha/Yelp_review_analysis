The service was quick and attentive. \n\nIt was a very busy Friday night when I visited. We did have a reservation, but we waited around 30 minutes to actually be sat since they were running behind. The bar area and waiting room are sort of small for that many people to wait for tables, but they eventually sped up the process. The ambiance is perfect for a date night, birthday celebration, or girls night out. \n\nRegardless of the wait time, the food was still work the wait! I would recommend you try if you're a sushi lover.",

        "text": "Let me start by saying the sushi was delicious. No complaint there. I do think that a $40 entree should come with soup and/or salad, so I don't think it was a great value. I had to order more food because I was still hungry. I got the Mori sunumono. It was just ok. Too much ponzu. I do think service could improve. I sat at the sushi bar for a long time before finally getting a menu from another customer. I had trouble getting my order taken and the server acted like he was doing me a favor. If I'm spending $70 or $80 on dinner I want to feel like it's a little \"special\" or at least feel like my presence is valued. The restaurant was crowded and noisy and I guess it just wasn't my scene.",

        "text": "This place deserves a 5 stars on the foie gras nigiri alone. I love the use of material other than fish in their specialty dishes. Everything from quail egg to greenery, their presentation and flavor will bring all types of joy to your taste buds.\n\nThere is both an outside and an inside, but we opted for inside as it is summer. A very industrial mid century vibe going on with raw wood and sleet serving dishes. It has a small clash of styles but overall it feels very new era and I like that for this area in downtown. \n\nAs for pricing and food quality, the price matches the quality which means high for both. I don't think this is a place we will frequent because of that, but it does have some amazing flavors that I will go out of my way for in the future. \n\nOur waiter was super nice and loved explaining parts of the menu to us as well as talking about the foods he enjoyed and the flavors you get from each type of fish or way it is served. \n\nOne thing was the scallop roll (cassanova roll) felt overpowered and if we are being honest I think scallop has a very strong flavor that doesn't need to be smothered out by sauce like it was here. It would have been just as good as a shrimp roll and cost less. I would love to see more additions of scallop on their menu though if they can learn how to balance the flavors for that specific fish a little better.",

I'm an avid sushi eater and it's very rare that I'm disappointed in sushi, but the King Crab Roll was just meh to me. Maybe it just wasn't my niche. My date tried the Island Breeze roll which I sampled and that was very nice and refreshing. I still see myself coming back and trying the Shinobi roll which everyone swears by so we will see!",

The service was impeccable, with attentive staff ensuring every detail was taken care of. I literally dropped my chopstick on the ground and less than 2 seconds later, our waiter switched them out for me before I even got to bring it up!\n\nNow, let's talk about the star of the show--the \"Shinobi Roll.\" This culinary masterpiece left an indelible mark on my taste buds. The combination of crab salad and tempura crunch provided a delightful texture, while the Smokey-tasting filet mignon on top elevated the dish to new heights. The interplay of sweet and Smokey flavors danced on the tip of my tongue, creating a harmonious blend that I will never forget.",

Yes, that's an early dinner, but it's worth it! \n\nThe restaurant's address is Howell Mill but the entrance is at the corner of 8th and Brady. There is some street parking but we used the parking garage in the same complex.  Once inside, the place is beautifully decorated.  It was a nice day so we ate outside in their covered seating.  \n\nWe had a hard time choosing what to order since their menu is large and so many things were intriguing.  Here is what we ordered (great recommendations from our server):\n\nEggs Benedict\nTuna Crisp\nOrange is the New Black\nWagyu Sando\nCeviche\nHashtags Roll\nRice to Meet You\nBread pudding with butter pecan ice cream\n\nWe loved everything we ate.  I can't pick a favorite, they were all equally great!",

        "text": "Eight Sushi Lounge came highly recommended by friends and the Yelp reviews backed it up, so my girlfriends and I made a reservation to dine here on a recent Saturday night!\n\nOur reservation was for four people at 8pm... we arrived on time and had a short wait, so we ordered some drinks at the bar and enjoyed the fun restaurant vibe while we waited in the lobby.\n\nAlly was server, and she was attentive and had some solid recommendations for us.  Three of us love sushi and the fourth ordered a salmon entree.  Unfortunately for her, it took a really long time for her dinner to arrive and she ended up spending most of the evening watching us eat.  Due to the delay, they did the right thing and comped the salmon.\n\nAs for the rest of us, we enjoyed everything we ordered - both food and wine.  My favorites were the explosion roll, ginger salad, hotate nigiri, and sake nigiri.   The only thing I didn't love was the \"iced ponzu\" served with the kampachi serrano.\n\nAll in all this was a fun and delicious experience!",

I called 5 days before and got the last reservation they had (9:30pm), so I figured it must be a hoppin place.\n\nEight Sushi Lounge wound up being TOO hoppin. They overbooked their reservations so badly that couples with reservations were spilling out of the lobby when we arrived, and the host said we'd be seated at 10pm, not 9:30pm. When we finally entered the dining room it was comically packed with couples, 2-tops as far as the eye could see. The ambiance was romantic but it was hard to concentrate on the lit candles and white tablecloths when you felt like you were in a refugee camp of Valentine's Day couples. \n\nThat being said, I'm still giving Eight Sushi Lounge a good review (4-star) because their servers were somehow still speedy and charismatic, and their host handled the chaos with a surprising amount of grace. Additionally, their sushi really was amazing. I see why folks think it's the best in Atlanta.",

When it's cold out, I crave their miso. It's the best miso soup I've ever had. \n\nEight sushi lounge is my go-to spot for birthday/special occasions. It's worth every penny and minute spent here.",

The ambiance was quiet and Asian themed. Nicely lit and done on the inside. I was seated an hr before closing and the hostess and waiter were super nice and customer service-oriented.\n\nA friend recommended I order their lychee martini and I haven't turned back since trying. 8sushi made a good first impression and introduction to the lychee cocktail. I had two kinds of rolls which blew my tastebuds out of the water. I did not think I'd get great sushi in ATL. \n\nOverall, it is a MUST GO - 10/10 highly recommended and I would visit 10x over!",

While the food is good, the lighting, the music, even the names of the dishes are funky and fun.\n\nParking - midtown parking can be dicey, so consider a ride share. Service was exceptional, but I already mentioned that.\n\nThe FOOD:\nTuna Crisp - FREAKING AMAZING, just not enough of it.\nFoi Gras Nigiri - a must try, but not nearly as interesting tasting as it sounds.\nEggs Benedict - looks amazing, but cold and different. Not my thing.\nFried green beans -DELIGHTFUL especially dipped on the sauce.\nHashtag Roll - best dish of the night.\nCasanova Roll - good but not as good as the Hashtag\n\nThis is a super date night place.\n\nTips:\n- try the tuna crisps\n- keep an open mind, this is not your typical sushi joint.\n- hashtag it, the hashtag roll is so good.\n- Slurge?  Try the beverage menu, it is almost as interesting as the sushi menu.",

And on top of this, you walk in to BLARING music. But still, we heard great reviews on the food, so we were here to try it out. Yes, some of the food was outstanding: the miso glazed bass and the foie gras on sushi rice. Wow. But the tuna crisp did not look fresh and I thought the gyoza was the worst I had ever tasted! The nigiri  was good. But when you get a bill for $250 for 4 people, it really makes you rethink....",

        "text": "I was anticipating this place for awhile as I kept hearing rave reviews about it. I had a few issues initially with a larger party, so I decided to come with just a couple of people to get a better experience. \n\nThe fish quality was not what I was expecting. I expected a buttery melt in your mouth sort of experience with their sashimi and nigiri. The salmon was not that. I took a bite and the silver skin got it stuck midway through. The flavor of the sauce was also lacking a lot. \n\nOrange is the new black is what the salmon plate was called, and I honestly just wouldn't get that again. \n\nI got the 8 piece chefs nigiri plate. They charge an extra 10$ if you get individual pieces instead of pairs. Bringing the 8 pieces to $50.00. Would be fine, if the flavor was good but it just wasn't. \n\nThe rolls were good. Very tasty and beautiful. The tuna crisp was nice. Tasted like an elevated crème fraise crispy salmon bagel (although it was tuna)\n\nThe Walu was amazing. (Nigiri) That was the only thing I took a bite of that blew my mind. I was surprised because it's seared which I usually don't care for, but the flavor of the miso glaze and the texture of the escolar was so good. \n\nI do think they got stingy on the chefs plate. I think it would have been a different experience had I ordered individual pieces of nigiri  it seems. \n\nThe eggs Benedict (bed of rice, spicy tuna, sunny side up quail egg) was very lovely. Mild in flavor. \n\nThe server was SO sweet and patient while we explored the menu. I just don't think the price point matched the fish quality. The rolls were not expensive at all, but to really experience this place properly, you're not filling up on rolls I'd say you wanna try their \"mind boggling\" menu items.",

You must know that all sushi isn't just raw fish. They have vegetarian, baked and deep fried options available at every sushi restaurant. Just ask your server or waiter and they will share what options they have available! I had the pleasure of being taken care of by Isaac and tried everything he recommended! He's an expert and has a great sense of urgency like no other. I'm asking for him every time! And you can too! Tell him Slim sent you!! \n\nNote: Please, don't use my name looking for a discount!

I believe it's 10$.\n\nstreet parking is also available for, I believe, $2 an hr. i hear many people complaining about finding parking but I've personally never had an issue\n\n\n\nP R I C E \n140",

We had the Casanova roll, the chicken teriyaki, the bread pudding, and the Langoustine (my bf loved this and he's not even a fan of seafood). The Maiden's Kiss cocktail was great too! Keep in mind it can be a little crowded and loud on a busy night, but overall the food and service makes up for it.",

Very attentive and gave us amazing suggestions that did not miss! Arjun and Garrett at the bar were fantastic, made us our favorite drinks and amazing drinks off the menu. They took time to explain so much about drinks and catered to our particular taste! Love eight sushi",
