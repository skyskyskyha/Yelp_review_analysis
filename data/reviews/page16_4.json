        "text": "We have been going to Campagnolo for many years, especially under the leadership of Alice. The food is consistent, not extraordinary, but definitely enjoyable. The service, now that is something to discuss. Again, In the past, we've had amazing service. I have even taken clients there on numerous occasions, and there is a group of us that choose Campagnola for our birthdays celebrations (generally 4x) a year. \n\nUntil this evening, Sunday, September 30th, celebrating one of our friends birthday, a party of 10, a few apps, salads, and of course adult bevs. We had a rather rude, abrasive young server by the name of Dylan. Even though he forgot a few adult bevs, we can look past that as we are a party of 10. Until....it's time for dessert and we bring our own. Rainbow cupcakes. Honestly, our group would not have ordered dessert anyway but Dylan chose to charge each of us a little over a dollar($) because we brought our cheap rainbow cupcakes. Seriously. We just dropped over $600 in 1.5 hours and you are going to charge us this because we brought in our cheap Publix cupcakes. It's not the $1 I'm upset with but the fact that he dropped it on us as the checks were delivered. And seriously, La Grotta doesn't even do this!!!!! \n\nA few of us all agreed we will never go back here again. This is not Servant Leadership!!!!  I wish I could take back the 20% tip Dylan received from us but that does no good. Maybe this rating will teach Dylan and Campagnolo a lesson!!!",

I would say that this place is in the price range of Maggianos but more upscale. Our waiter Hakim (spell check) was absolutely wonderful. Definitely recommend him. Tried the chicken entree with a lemon wine  sauce but would not recommend it. However the restaurant allowed us to get the lasagna which was absolutely amazing. I would come back for that. I enjoyed the ambiance and definitely enjoyed my time here. Reminder: there is valet parking but it's complimentary.",

The menu doesn't have a huge selection, but they do a good job with the meals that they do have. I ordered the frittata and a Bloody Mary. The frittata was a good size and flavourful, though could have done with more seasoning. The Bloody Mary was excellent. The area is trendy and the restaurant had a good crowd with a nice vibe.

I ordered the mussels and crab ravioli. The menu is a bit pricey for the portions. For instance the crab ravioli is $13 but you get two. The raviolis are good. They use a good amount of crab. The mussels were scorched. The flavors were there but a burnt after taste. \n\nThey have a nice patio but it's located on a busy street. There is parking in the back by Kats cafe but some days I believe there is a valet charge.\n\nOverall their food is good and their breakfast is pretty good too!",

I almost forgot about the burger when I tasted the onion ring! So tasty! I also really like their french toast.

Possibly the best lasagna that I have ever had in my life. The noodles were so fresh and the cheese and sauce were cooked to perfection. Granted it was a $20 plate of lasagna but I felt like it was well worth it. \n\nWe also had the roasted cauliflower. Pretty good but I could've done without it. For dessert we had the almond cake with strawberry rhubarb. That was delicious too and reminded me of somebody's grandmom's pound cake. Overall, Im excited to go back when I visit Atlanta.",

        "text": "I am rarely craving Italian food - although I love it when I eat it, it always seems heavy and too much (and yes, I get that I don't have to eat it all).\n\nCampagnolo was wonderful!!  We sat outside on the patio and the whole experience was lovely.  The wait staff were attentive and made great recommendations.  We started by sharing 2 salads - a very standard, but very tasty, caprese and a lovely fennel and blood orange salad that was delightful - the perfectly interesting flavor combination with blood orange and olives!\n\nI would normally never order lasagna (heavy and too much...), but on his rec I decided to go for it and was very glad I did.  It was a more deconstructed version of lasagna - not casserole like at all - and the flavors and portion size were spot on!  My dining partner had a cioppino - delicious!  \n\nAlthough we sat outside, the experience was still intimate and very reminiscent of dining on the street in Florence!  We loved it and plan to go back!",

        "text": "Located in mid-town, a place known for difficulty in parking your car, I found it to be easier than expected. Firstly, if you are like me, do not like to pay for valet, you can drive up Argonne Ave to look for some curb-side parking. We went there on a Friday evening about 8pm and we lucked out on a spot. Yay for us.\n\nIt was a short walk to Campagnolo. When we arrived, the outside seating area was still quite empty, we were shown a table and it took a while for our server to come out. Think it wasn't a good day for him, he didn't feel very happy that day. But he was cordial and did his job, no-nonsense. I like servers like that. You feel like he could give you a straight answer type of guy.\n\nI ordered a mushroom carpaccio without knowing what it was except that it was going to be raw and a side of roasted brussels sprouts. I didn't feel like meat at all after 2 nights of overnight shoots, I lacked sleep and just needed to go to sleep without hunger pangs. My husband had the lasagne. And we shared a pate, the chicken liver mousse crostini.\n\nThe pate, creamy, lightly salted came with a dish of tomato jam and a few slices of toasted bread exploded in my mouth and woke my taste buds! It was so good that we soon realised we had finished all the bread and still had half the dish of pate, so we took it home and made it last for 1 more day. The jam, which was tomato didn't taste like tomato at all, so sweet and jello like. I could blind taste it and would think it was strawberry jam or something. Very good.\n\nMy carpaccio came and it was sliced brown baby shitake on a plate of arugula and topped with creamy, yellow dressing and some slices of sundried tomato. Very refreshing on a hot summer's day. My brussels sprouts were well roasted, lightly salted too. And was a big serving for one person. We had some leftovers too. My husband's lasagne................. good amount of tomato, had good sweetness, contrasted really well with the fragrant cheese. The pasta within the dish was soft and absorbed liquids making it tasty with some texture. OMG it was even better with the brussels sprouts, even more texture to the entire dish. If you are there, try it. We soon lapped up all we ordered and some. I nearly forgot to mention our dessert. We had the panna cotta, some times I get a little iffy about panna cotta as it could sometimes come too creamy, too milky, or just too dry. This - I LIKEY. It was firm, moist and the berries that sat with this dessert were sweet and with the right amount of tang, not overpowering. Will be back to try the brunch next time but without our big dog.\n\nLastly, they are super dog-friendly. If our big Pyrenees could go, any other dogs can go. They brought out some dog treats for Simba and ice cold water too for him. If he had thumbs he would give a thumbs-up sign.",

I will definitely be ordering that next time I am in town and visit this place. \n\nDefinitely worth a try. Just don't be wanting to start your day with a Bloody Mary early on a Sunday.

        "text": "Update (2/14/13)\n\nBRUSSELS SPROUT PANINI - $9\nRoasted brussels sprouts, proscuitto, spicy anchovy aioli, Fontina cheese on ciabatta bread, and served with a side of arugula salad. I'm a huge brussels sprout fan so no surprise I loved this sandwich. \n\n****************************************************************************************\n\nThanks to Scoutmob for introducing me to this place - one of my new favorite lunch spots. This is the location of the former Big Red Tomato and Sweet Devil Moon. \n\nARUGULA SALAD - $6\nBlack pepper lemon vinaigrette, toasted pine nuts, parmesan cheese. The reviews raved about it, I'm a huge arugula fan, and Campagnolo's salad didn't disappoint. Yum. \n\nCAMPAGNOLO BURGER - $11\nThe reviews and my servers from both visits raved about the burger too - I agree w/ them :) House ground double patty, mortadella, spicy pepperoni, provolone cheese, picked onions, garlic bread bun. Burger was salty but I still enjoyed it - I liked the aioli-like sauce. Also came w/ Sweetwater 420 battered onion rings - very crispy! No surprise I was super full after eating the salad, burger, AND rings. \n\nORECCHIETTE - $10\nThe reviews and server also raved about this dish - again I agree. Housemade sausage, broccoli rabe, parmesan, cherry tomatoes. I think there was enough pasta to make two meals ... except I couldn't stop eating. Nice tasty pasta dish.\n\nNext time I'd like to try the Brussels Sprouts Panini ($10) and the Roasted Beet Salad ($8). \n\nOverall 4 stars for their great menu, reasonable prices, nice service, great space, not being crowded during lunch, and free parking in the back. Definitely check this place out.",

        "text": "If you're considering this place for dinner, consider your decision made: EAT HERE. I had an amazing experience eating dinner here on a Thursday night at 9pm with my parents (visiting from NYC).  Here's what I loved:\n\n- FOOD: The food was amazing. The beet salad has this great beet purée (very unique) and is a well balanced delicious dish. The caprese has meaty tomatoes and a huge serving of cheese. The roasted garlic on top was amazing. Salmon was cooked perfectly- medium on the inside, crispy skin on the outside. The pastas were cooked perfectly and the little ear pasta was well balanced with a bit of spicy sausage and roasted tomato. Loved it. Portion sizes are huge, consider getting the half portions (available for some dishes). The bread pudding melts in your mouth. Wines are very inexpensive by the glass.\n\n- SERVICE: Jason was an amazing server. He was incredibly nice, knowledgable about the menu and helped us to navigate our way through it to our final meal.  The manager came by a few times to see how we were doing and he was very warm and welcoming. \n\n- ATMOSPHERE: You have options for inside and outside seating. I love the casual yet cool space. It felt very comfortable and was perfect for our post-comedy show dinner.\n\nHands down this was a five star restaurant and experience.  Also the best restaurant I ate at during my 4 day trip to Atlanta.",

After driving 30 minutes we were prompted to show our vaccination cards. There was zero warning on open table and the did not notify us prior so our party was entirely unprepared. The beyond rude hostess tried to tell us that this was on open table and that this had been in place for 6 months. BOTH of these statements could not be more false. It is the last sentence in open table and all it says is that you \"must be vaccinated\" but lacks any mention of required proof: LIE. The hostess also tried to tell me that this policy had been in place for 6 months - my boyfriend and I were there in August and this was not the case: LIE. Such a disappointment and we had been so looking forward to dinner and excited to show our friends from out of town. I will never give them a single penny or any of my business again.",

        "text": "I came here with my family during brunch/lunchtime on a Sunday. I was hoping to try the food since reviews here were generally positive, but unfortunately, the front of house staff were rude to us. We did not have a reservation, but: (1) it was almost 1pm, and brunch/lunch service was clearly winding down, and (2) their entire patio area, and most of the inside of the restaurant was empty. \n\nWhen we asked the host if we might be able to grab a table, he gave us a very rude look (despite the fact that none of us had been rude or were dressed inappropriately, etc.), inaudibly conferred with another staff member, and then wandered away without giving us an answer. Several minutes passed and then someone else asked if we had been helped, to which we asked the first person for an update. He acted as if we were doing him a huge inconvenience and insisted that every single one of the empty tables was reserved, and that it would probably be impossible to squeeze in 4 people. Now, this may have been the case, but we were standing there for at least 15 minutes, and not a single one of the parties for whom these tables were mysteriously reserved materialized. \n\nMy mom and I have both worked in restaurants in the past, and as a result, we make it a point to be patient customers and give waitstaff the benefit of the doubt. However, in this case, even if the answer were an emphatic no, there was no reason for us to have been treated rudely. I make it a habit to spend money in places that treat their customers well, so I won't be returning here.",

Appetizers was the cheese and meat board and bruschetta. Meat and cheese board was average, what you expect, the bruschetta was one piece of bread cut in half, again, average. Pear martini was good and not too sweet. The veggie lasagna is the best of the plates, so are the sides of cauliflower and Brussels sprouts- above average. The salmon and lamb were average and on the salty side. The lamb was the most salty and I wouldn't get it again. Not a fan of the salmon which was also salty. For dessert we got tiramisu and panacotta. The panacotta was plain, nothing great. The homemade tiramisu was good, but not great. Again, 3 Stars. Parking is Street on piedmont road. Nice location, very clean place. People do seem to like this place, so try it, but to me it's an average place. Nothing bad about it, nothing great either. See for yourself!",

I had their version of a margarita (La Paloma) and husband had their version of a lemon drop (Aaaaah Sorento).  The bitters in la paloma were a bit overpowering for me...neither of us were impressed by the drinks and switched to wine and a plain dirty martini.\n\nNext up were the beet salad and the arugula salad.  Both were delicious.  Though the arugula salad only has a few ingredients, it felt full and rich.\n\nFor dinner we tried the lasagna and the lamb marsala.  The lasagna was fantastic.  Spectacular.  I am not easily impressed by lasagna and I was blown away.  The marsala was good, but didn't wow us.\n\nFor dessert we had the  Banana Walnut Semifreddo at the recommendation of our server.  I wasn't impressed.  I wish that we had tried something else.\n\nThe service was really good.  Steven V. did a great job!\n\nIt's a nicer (i.e. pricier) place, but the servers were mostly wearing shorts (seemed a little out of place) or jeans...so you can definitely come casual.",

Who would've known that a nice Italian restaurant has great brunch?! \n\nThe best part of the restaurant is their front patio that overlooks Piedmont. One a sunny, breezy day, there's nothing better than sipping some mimosas or beach bellinis (refills are 1/2 off). \n\nI ordered the Campagnolo breakfast, which sounds like a basic 2 eggs any way, polenta (grits), sausage, and toast. But my God... this simple breakfast was infused with crazy awesome Italian flavors and upgraded to a whole new level. Those sausages were sweet and spicy, and added great flavor to the polenta and eggs. The ciabatta toast also had nice flavors and textures as well to complement the rest of the dish. This may have been my favorite breakfast ever. \n\nI also tried a bite of my friend's Eggs Benedict which also had great Italian flavors in it - mortadella (sausage), and tomato hollandaise. My other friend ordered the shrimp and polenta (grits), and it had bacon sun-dried tomato pesto!! Both were amazingly fantastic. \n\nParking is a bit difficult in the Piedmont area, but if you're able to snag a spot, I would highly recommend coming to Campagnolo for their weekend brunch and top it off with a  nice walk around the park. \n\nThe missed star goes to service - everything seemed to come slower than we would've liked.",

        "text": "Campagnolo is located in the heart of midtown Atlanta and nestled in between \"The Pet Set\" and the restaurant \"Ten\" on the popular and busy Piedmont Ave.\n\nThe atmosphere is laid back and casual, as there were several couples who had their dogs on a leash while dining in front of the restaurant. Being located next door to a pet grooming spot, it's kind of expected you might see proud animal lovers stopping by to enjoy the neighborhood and some fine Italian dining. So if you're allergic to dogs, you might want to consider dining inside.\n\nMy wife and I are doggie parents, and used to take our miniature poodle Mr. Snuggles to the Pet Set to get his \"fly guy\" look on, so we were perfectly fine dining outside and watching people walk their dogs in the neighborhood.\n\nSo let's get down to the food! I am Italian and have worked in the culinary industry for many years--specifically in fine Italian restaurants. Therefore, my goal is to provide you with an honest and thorough assessment of the items I tasted.\n\nFirst, my wife and I ordered the mussels and the calamari as appetizers. Heads up, they are both pretty large portions, so if you're not feeling like one of those characters in a Snickers commercial, you might consider ordering the appetizers as a meal or just focus on enjoying one appetizer to start.\n\nThe mussels are cooked in a sweet vermouth wine along with crushed tomatoes and sliced scallions. Most Italian restaurants cook their mussels with \"garlic\" and their choice of wine-particularly some type of white wine, so I was a bit surprised when I scooped out my first victim.\n\nThe focus of the flavor was hence \"sweet,\" as there was little to no garlic flavor infused into the broth. The pairing of the sweet vermouth wine with the scallions and diced sweet onion really makes this dish special if you enjoy a sweet dish. I personally like more of a garlic taste in my broth with a \"dry\" white wine, but I must say that the mussels tasted great! They weren't overcooked into a wad of bubblegum and were soft and easy to remove from their shells.\n\nHowever, I would have preferred a side of \"warm\" bread for extra dipping, but after requesting some extra bread, our waiter brought back a basket of bread that was not warm--a BIG NO NO by Italian standards!!\n\nWe also ordered the calamari which is \"sautéed\" and NOT flash fried. Yes, make sure you read the menu carefully, because this is also a different preparation than what you might typically be accustomed to. The calamari is sautéed with pine nuts, white wine, tomatoes, scallions and here is the kicker--\"raisins!\" Yuck! Well that is what my wife said because she dislikes raisins, but they are \"golden\" raisins (oooh fancy) that aren't too dominant in the overall flavor profile. However, like the mussels, there is a sweet note to this dish, but the difference here is that the tomato sauce contains cracked red pepper and the raisins provide a delicate balance of sweet mixed with spicy, so it actually works well in my opinion.  \n\nThe thing I didn't like was that the calamari and sauce was portioned on top of a slice of bread, which became extremely soggy and essentially scooping up mush. Not my thing, but overall a pretty good dish.\n\nI had the lamb marsala as my entree. This was pretty tasty, but the wine reduction was not as \"pure\" as I would typically make in a Marsala dish. Basically, it appeared that they used corn starch or a rue (butter and flower) to rely on thickening up the sauce, instead of allowing the Marsala wine to cook down and thicken up into a true reduction. I could tell by the consistency of the sauce; when I picked up my fork and allowed the sauce to drip...it was making streaks as if it was hardening too quickly-this is a sign of adding too much flower or corn starch. Although the flavor was good, I would have preferred more mushrooms and my mashed potatoes positioned on the side of my dish, as opposed to the lamb laying directly on top of the mashed potatoes-too much moisture in one spot for me.\n\nOverall, the service was great and our waiter was very kind. The atmosphere is chill and the food is tasty with some different taste profiles for your pallet to experience. If I could give 3 1/2 stars I would; what keeps them back from having 4 stars are the few inconsistencies with the food preparation that I discussed above.\n\nMore importantly, I would dine here again to try another dinner entree on the menu. In addition, this was my first review on Yelp and I hope that it was helpful. I look forward to sharing more reviews in the near future...until then...happy dining everybody! Cheers!\n\n-Tom",

The restaurant was filled with karaoke (they have this every Friday) christmas carols. So the ambiance was relaxing and appealing. \n\nI was seated in the back away from the noise but next to a drafty window so it was cold. My meal had ups and downs the best part being the bread an olive oil (free) and the lasagna which they are known for. If you love beignets do not order them from here. The ice cream tastes like a hint of banana and frozen ice with no sugar. The pork shanks falls off the bone but it's served with shaved ricotta salata (cheese that taste like plastic) and non satisfying gritty mashed potatoes. Overall I would only go back to sit at the bar and have appetizers on Karaoke night. It just isn't worth sitting down for a whole meal.",

For real, it's best that I've had.  Made with bolognese sauce and bechamel cheese, it was quite remarkable.  I enjoyed it immensely.  \n\nI must say, though, that I don't particularly care for how the calamari is prepared. It's in a tomato based sauced and served on top of bread, which gets soggy pretty quickly.  It's not breaded nor fried.  \n\nOur server did a great job attending to our party of eight.  Glasses were refilled properly and we were checked on at the appropriate intervals.  \n\nI really liked the space and atmosphere of the place.  Whatever Pandora or Spotify station they had it on was a good one.  I savored that lasagna while grooving a bit to some Maxwell, Erykah Badu, and some D'Angelo. Smooth.  \n\nThey have complimentary valet parking and while the restaurant is on Piedmont, you enter off of 10th.  Because you have to leave the same way you come in and this is the same valet parking area for several other restaurants (like Zocola), it was a tight pickle with cars coming and going in a cramped space.\n\nOverall, I found this place to be a good one.  I know for sure that I'll be back for that lasagna.",

        "text": "Food was good. Good caesar salad, good but very garlicy mussels, and the pasta dishes were tasty. The vegetable dishes were a bit lacking. Supposedly, the Brussel sprouts are the star of the show, but we felt they were bland, unseasoned, and tasted just like plain old Brussel sprouts - they were also overcooked and a bit mushy. The desserts, including the tiramisu, were very good. In terms of service, unfortunately there is a woman who works there who was a real bummer to our dinner. Not only did she seat us when we arrived, but she also brought our food to the table. She was extremely unpleasant - I even commented to our server how miserable she was. Everyone at our table thought she was quite unpleasant. Our server was pretty good, although not the most attentive. With this in mind, I'd give the food a 3.5-4 star rating but service only 2-2.5.",

It has greAt vibe and tries to be cozy but the chairs arent quite as comfortable as I would have liked them to be; hence the 4 stars. Great place nontheless along with amazing service!",

        "text": "Cute little place in the heart of Midtown. Came here on a yelp recommendation but was not very impressed. It was Sunday brunch and the place was busy and they  were accommodating enough to give me a table instead of making me sit at the bar and I will say that all of the service members were very friendly and the hostess was running around like crazy doing a lot of things at once. \n\nThe food was a disappointment. Ordered a chicken piccata sandwich which was basically an unseasoned Large piece of chicken breast on some very good bread. It was not breaded and there was no lemon sauce nor was  there any aïoli. It came with an arugula salad  which also didn't have any dressing.  Ordered a side of creamy polenta which was actually very pleasant. I tend to like polemta a little more firm but they did advertise it as creamy.  My waiter was very friendly but seemed distracted  so subsequently my iced tea didn't get refilled and he was pretty AWOL through most of the meal. In all fairness to him, it looked like he was having to serve tables on two different sides of the restaurant.\nI should've sent the food back and made them dress it out the way they described it on the menu but I was very hungry and just ready to get \nto the airport. \n\nIf I'm back in Atlanta, I might consider giving this place another try.",

The parking situation could be a lil confusing since Piedmont is a one way street. Valet is in front of the 10th&piedmont bar, just FYI.\n\nFood: the salumi was good, pasta and Italian wedding soup was both delicious. Roasted cauliflower tasted a bit strange, not my taste.\n\nService: our waiter was awesome. Very attentive and friendly. \n\nOverall, I'd go back if I want Italian and don't wanna go too far.",

There was a piano concert with show tunes while the audience sang along. Great place and we will be back soon.",
