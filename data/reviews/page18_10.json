        "text": "Um yeah, I wouldn't come here. My husband and I were craving BBQ so we stopped here for dinner. The space itself is very nice - it feels very open and there's a lot of seating available. When we went to place our order, we asked for the combo platter (2 meats with 2 sides) and a small order of the chicken. We wanted to get the ribs and brisket, but our waiter told us they ran out of that and we were supposed to be told prior to being seated. Okay, off to a rough start, but fine, we'll get something else. Sausage please! Nope, also out of that. Are you guys kidding me? How are you out of food already? It was only 6:30 pm!\n\nWe received our order within 5-10 minutes of placing it. That's odd, barbeque takes time and this came out super quick. And we finally found out why. Brisket was a bit dry and pulled pork was nothing to rave about. The only meat I liked was the chicken. That was actually very juicy and flavorful. The mac and cheese honestly takes like kraft mac and cheese. The corn souffle was amazing, but it was drenched in butter. The butter settled at the bottom of the dish - it was quite disgusting once you realized how much butter they used to make that side.\n\nService was okay, nothing to brag about. Overall, I wouldn't come back. There are much better BBQ places that is also cheaper.",

Took an hour to get a table, and that's while seeing tables sit open for 30 min plus. Once seated it took another 20 minutes to get water and 10 after that to get an order taken. Still waiting for food after another 20 minutes... we'd have left if we hadn't  already invested so much time...\nOk, food was good. Based on the other reviews this is probably a good place to eat... just needs more help during events - which I assume is a good part of their business?",

Sent them back and asked for something less well done; server complied but second go round still meh. All the sides were dry too (mac n cheese, corn casserole etc). My hunch is they smoke early, meat is re-warmed for hours; sides are preprepared early to the same affect. Very limited menu too. Wouldn't recommend.",

The service here was great, very attentive waitress. The restaurant itself is really nice as well. Sadly the food was only okay. I got the pulled chicken with potato salad and my bf got the ribs and brisket with cornbread and Mac and cheese. The chicken needed a little more flavor in my opinion, even with massive amounts of their bbq sauce smothered on the meat, still tasted bland. I wasn't expecting my potato salad to be chunks of potato, lol. The Mac and cheese was alright, the cornbread was different to me, but tasted really good! The ribs and brisket were okay said my boyfriend but idk really. He's spoiled with his brothers bbq. Nice location, and they validate parking if you park across the street.

This is what makes Yelp so awesome.\n\nTwin Smokers motto is 'Burbon and bbq'.  They do both very well. We were seated immediately and then our server brought us some pork rinds...which were very tasty!  I had a brisket sandwich with corn soufflé as a side.  The brisket had an excellent smoke flavor and was VERY tender.  The corn soufflé was excellent as well.  They have a variety of BBQ sauces based on different regions of the south. I went with Memphis. \n\nI also had a cocktail....Georgia peach tea...it had Burbon in it. A perfectly balanced drink...not to strong, not too sweet. \n\nI cannot wait to come back to Atlanta and eat here again.",

        "text": "I was not very impressed with Twin Smoker's. The service was great, and the sides as well. However it is the meat that makes a bbq joint, and they fell a bit short for me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I shared 1/2lb of pulled pork and the blue sky combo plate with brisket and the sausage. The pulled pork was dry. Putting sauce on it helped (and they have a great sauce selection), but I shouldn't need to douse my pulled pork in sauce to enjoy it. Their brisket was good (not dry!) with good flavor. My issue is there was barely any of it! For the price of the combo I was expecting more meat and was very disappointed when I saw how much was on the plate. The sausage tasted good, but nothing too special.\n\nSides: Cornbread was really good - I love cornbread and theirs is one of the top ones ive had. Mac and Cheese was delicious, very cheesy. Their season side was this cream of corn kind of thing and it was tasty, a nice blend of sweet/savory.\n\nFor the price I was expecting better barbeque, but everything else was decent. Maybe I am spoiled from the bbq in Texas but Twin Smoker's didn't meet my expectations.",

The ribs were a bit dry. However, the brisket was delicious as always and are writhing coming in for a try. Also, the varieties of various bbq sauce is great. They have sweet, spiced sweet, and spicy for those with numb taste buds. Solid place, but a bit overpriced for what you get these days. Nonetheless, I finished all my food cuz I'm not a chum and I love some good southern bbq.",

All of it was tasty. Ribs and Brisket seem to be the overwhelming favorite of the group. Great Beer selection, but most of it is in cans. A nice ice cold glass is delivered to go with the beer, upon request. \n\nThe sides were Very good, especially the greens and broccoli salad. Everyone went home very full!",

It's far better than a chain restaurant in a mall parking lot. \n\nMaybe I was disappointed because I read some really thrilled-sounding reviews. As if people drove specifically to go here. Twin Smokers does nothing \"wrong.\" There's just nothing truly inspired about it. \n\nWhile authentic in terms their smoking low-and-slow chicken and pork, the result does not compete with places that put a lot of love into what they make. Also, the portions are small.\n \nThe variety of the sauces at the table is a welcome addition. My enthusiasm for pan-regional saucing made up for some of my disappointment when I saw the  ice-cream-scoop-size servings of meat and side. \n\nTrying one sauce after another, the \"Southern\" one was tasty - but none of them feel like they have been really cared for. These are not recipes that have been passed down through generations, or refined through passionate exploration. \n\nThe pickles flung on a piece of paper next to your plate for down-home flair, are made with a homemade brine. Those are a nice touch. \n\nIf you love bbq, it is not a destination spot, but it is solid. You might be really happy stumbling onto this bbq if you find it around the corner from your hotel.",

        "text": "I love barbecue!  I've eaten regional varieties from Chicago to St. Louis to Memphis to south Florida, and enjoy them all.  That's why I was excited to try Twin Smokers just around the corner from where I live.\n\nI've always said it's hard to find bad barbecue.  Well, you can stop looking.\n\nThis place looks and smells the part of great barbecue, but that ends at the taste buds, sadly.  \n\nI tried the wings.  I couldn't finish an order of five.  They were extremely tough, not tender the way smoked meat should be.  They were dry and rubbery, with way too much smoke flavor, which obscured the taste of the meat.  Unable to finish two, I moved on.\n\nThe pulled pork was also tough and dry.  Drowning it in sauce made it edible.  The macaroni and cheese was -- continuing the theme here -- dry and seemed old.  It appears to be smoked also, because there is black in there.  Macaroni and cheese shouldn't be black.  \n\nSurprisingly, this place doesn't offer barbecue baked beans.  That should've been my first red flag.  Instead they offer pinto beans.  I like a good pinto, so I thought it would be a suitable substitute.  Wrong.  If you hate pintos but love onions and onions and seasonings and seasonings and parsley (or was that cilantro?) you'll like the watery pintos, the only thing that wasn't dry.\n\nTo finish it off, the banana pudding was passable, but the recipe tastes exactly like the Eagle brand condensed milk recipe for banana pudding, made with whipped cream.  It's light and tasty, but when you're eating out, you want something more than you can make at home.  There was just nothing special here.\n\nI really wanted to love this place.  It's in walking distance from home and I'd be a regular customer.  Sadly, I won't be returning.  It was truly that bad.  The hours posted on the door say they're open from 11:00 until the meat runs out.  With taste like this, the place will never close.",

Was in the neighb in the ATL on biz and, suddenly overtaken by an insane craving for BBQ that would not be ignored, happened upon Twin Smokers via Yelp just now on a rainy late afternoon.\n\n#DIVINEINTERVENTION!!\n\nI have discovered the South's Best BBQ!! The St Louis-style ribs were falling off the bone, pure lean meat and BEYOND succulent.  The Memphis sauce is what God intended BBQ sauce to taste like.  The brisket was so tender (14 hours in the smoker! #WhosOnTheNightShift?!!??) that I asked Tim the Cook, who was clucking over us like an attentive Mother Hen once he saw we were on our maiden voyage to the restaurant, if they offered a Senior Citizen discount (because if your Grandma forgot her dentures, she would STILL love that brisket, it's so tender!!)!!\n\nThe sides will wreck your diet, but are worth every calorie!   I, a true french fryaholic, did not miss their absence ONE NANOSECOND! Because I was distracted by the fluffy corn soufflé (corn pudding to the Real Southerners but that's semantics!)! And the broccoli salad!  The coleslaw! (Ok, the latter two are healthier options but oh, THAT CORN SOUFFLÉ!!)\n\nSlap your Mama good.  Which is pretty much the highest accolade a daughter of the Deep South can give.\n\nIt's better than Texas' Salt Lick. Better than Virgil's in NYC. Better than Southern Soul on St Simons Island in Georgia.  I don't know WHO the pit masters are behind the Twin Smokers (which are adorable and painted fire engine red btw -- #cute!!), but congrats, y'all, on the #SouthsBestBBQ!  And on your terrific staff serving it up -- Tim and Rachel were awesome.\n\nForgive me if I rave!",

It comes on a fresh toasted bun, and of course you have an array of sauces to choose from on the table already. I got mine with collard greens and the greens were pretty darn tasty! I'm glad my friend picked this to go to. I wanna go back, like right now, as I sit here starving at my office desk. Get the brisket-you will not be disappointed.\n\n*minus one star because everyone else at the table ordered mac and cheese that wasn't that great.

        "text": "First time visiting this downtown Atlanta BBQ spot. Met a friend from out of town who also like BBQ as much as I do so this was a no brainer primarily due to location near all the key downtown venues near Centennial Park. We  arrived right at the 11:30 AM opening time and were greeted and seated quickly. A quick look at the simple menu made us realize the tough choice of meats and sides. We settled on brisket, pulled pork, mac & cheese and corn soufflé. The brisket was good but I like mine a little more fatty. The bark and smoky flavor were spot on and really added to the flavor. The pulled pork hit the spot as well. The surprise of the day was the corn soufflé, it was simply smack yo mamma awesome. I have never had this side before but will certainly be on the lookout for it and will more than likely make a trip back to Twin Smokers just for this dish as it was incredible. Bottom line, if you are downtown and looking for some top notch BBQ, be sure to check out Twin Smokers. BBQ.",

It's near some of the main tourist attractions, such as the Coca Cola museum and Centennial Olympic Park, so its location is pretty convenient. I found this place on Yelp and decided to grab dinner there with a colleague on a Sunday night. I ordered the blue sky combo plate ($19), which came with two meats and two sides. I chose the brisket and the ribs, which according to the server were the two most popular. Both were good, but of the two, I would choose the brisket since I prefer baby back ribs and these were pork spare ribs. However, both meats were tender, smoky, and went great with their bbq sauces (lots of sauces to choose from and all at your table too!). For the sides, I chose the coleslaw and the mac and cheese. You can't go wrong with either, but nothing I would write home about. Overall, decent food, reasonable price for good portions, and nice ambiance so worth a try.",

The Mac and cheese had a weird after taste and the Collards were undercooked and hard to chew. Despite the food, this place is still worth a visit because it's a great place to go and have a drink and watch your favorite sporting events on one of the many tv screens. I overheard the bartender state that the beer is specially brewed next door so I decided to order a drink while I wait for my to go order and it was really good.

        "text": "Well, it was a ten minute walk down the way from my hotel, and recommended. The service is prompt, and friendly. We had a choice for table or bar, so selected a table. Couldn't figure out why the table was wet? The high humidity, with the air conditioners in this place, easily a formula for dripping condensation, water from above off of the ducting! So, don't sit directly under the air con ducting! We moved a few seats over and was fine. Drink and dinner was fast smoked brisket, smoke ribs and two sides Mac n' cheese and potato salad ( Atlanta version). The food was good, moist and tasty! Under $25 , refillable drink included. \n  So after we got our checks, I take a look at my check and they ran my card twice for two meals? Error? Or..... Yeah, I wanted to be positive and give the young lady the benefit of the doubt, a clerical mistake. So, first time, I was told it wasn't charged twice. Lucky I have real time check, no it was ran twice for two meals. The waitress, who said it wasn't, says now she'll correct it. The absence of my credit card started to raise my concerns. So, a Manager got involved cancelled error charges, and ran my card again. In actuality my meal was $22 and some change, but my credit card got impacted for almost $70.00 not too happy! So, overall atmospheres casual, experience would have rung up close to 4 1/2 , but the whole bill thing, didn't sit right with me and felt as a Manager, to compensate the customer. NOTHING! Not expecting, but you always , always give back extra hoping your business gets revisited or a great review! My thoughts? How many people eat and run without checking their dinner bill? Yeah! You hear me on that one! I'm full, enjoyed dinner",

Ordered half rack of St Louis ribs, and they were some of the best I have ever had. The surface was grilled to a pleasant, mouth-watering crisp, while the inside remained juicy and moist. Think about the joy of chewing up crispy skin while the inner layer fat literally melted in the mouth; it made me want to eat the ribs for as long as possible. Beer was also good. Very friendly and helpful staff. Not pricey at all ($30 tax included for half rack of ribs, a beer and a side). Totally worth it. Will visit again if coming back to Atlanta!",

The hostess was amazingly helpful in explaining the food choices as it was our first visit. \n\nWe had the recommended foods mention in other reviews, smoked chicken wings, brisket, corn soufflé and the house bbq sauce. The seasonal side was broccoli salad, so we got it for the green vegetable we need to eat to get well needed fiber and vitamins, LOL. It was very tasty, a traditional recipe with broccoli, sunflower seeds, raisins and mayonnaise dressing.\n\nAll the food was packaged so nicely in recyclable trays, and you get a very big portion of side dishes in deli containers.  With the smoked wings you get Ranch style dressing and bbq sauce, both made in house and tasty. I don't care for Ranch but this was really tasty. I would save it for my boring salad the next day. Brisket was tender and juicy. The corn soufflé is like a dessert to me because it is rich and sweet and buttery. All in all I would give 4.5 stars.",

        "text": "Twin Smokers BBQ is what you get when you plant a backyard, shack-style BBQ in the middle of a downtown metropolis area.  It is amazingly good, seems kind of out of place, but is seriously done well.\n\nLet me make this a compliment sandwich.\n\nThe food is excellent.  The menu is simple, straightforward and the staff is willing and able to help you make your decision on what side(s) you want.  Go with the pork or the brisket.  I use pulled pork as my BBQ barometer, and it certainly satisfied.  The coleslaw was probably the best that I have ever had.  Seriously.  Also, there is a very good local beer selection; more bottled than on tap, but I was very happy when the bartender gave me samples of my preferred types in tiny glasses before making a choice.  The fact that there were no fewer than 7 sauces to select from (I enjoyed the Sweet and Southern) was an added bonus.\n\nService is both good and bad.  The individual servers are amazing.  Please don't get me wrong, I was highly impressed by Amy's ability to give me knowledgeable suggestions on the food and drink menu.  However, there are simply not enough people behind the bar.  I watched who they had working and they are seriously hustling.  I can't imagine anyone not getting flustered by the amount of orders and people surrounding the large bar they have there.  They were working the their capacity, but they could have used some help.\n\nThe environment was pretty sweet.  Lot's of folk art, the smell of smoking meats, a huge pallet rack of wood and \"The Twins\" Elizabeth and Matthew at the back cooking the pork, brisket and chicken clear to everyone in the place made this a truly enjoyable spot to visit.\n\nAll said, I would frequent Twin Smokers if I lived in the area.",

        "text": "For good barbecue, it is usually recommended to go to dumpy little places by the side of the road. However, this place, despite being very nicely decorated and modern inside, has some fantastic barbecue! They have different smokers for different kinds of meat and that sort of attention to detail shows through in the food. \n\nLoved the brisket especially. \n\nI wish I could remember our waitress' name, but she was fantastic! Very friendly, patient, and helpful. \n\nI also enjoyed the adult milkshake to finish the meal.",
