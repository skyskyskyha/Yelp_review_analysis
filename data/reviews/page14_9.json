I wish I had asked the waiter for his name (he of course said his name when we sat down but I quickly forgot) because his great service and knowledge definitely added to value of our overall experience. The food was fantastic, I am from NY and have dined at many steakhouses, New York Prime is by far the best food I've had at a steakhouse. Appetizers we had the Oysters Rockefeller, Jumbo Baked Shrimp, and crab cakes. All three were amazing! Entree we had the New York Strip 16oz and the Bone-In rib 22oz with a side of cheesy mash. Steaks were perfectly cooked and charred just the right amount. I will absolutely be back here on my next visit to Atlanta!",

        "text": "Went here for my birthday with my family and it was one of the best food experiences of my life. The ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful, and amusingly there were steam punk cosplayers from a local convention at the bar. We started off with the Oysters Rockefeller, which were just amazing. Personally, I liked it better than the baked shrimp but both were extremely fresh that I could still taste the saltwater.  I ordered the Petite Steak and it was one of the best steaks of my life; I ordered it medium-well and it was amazingly tender and well-seasoned. My mother ordered the crab cakes, she said it was good but she said it was a bit salty (take that with a grain of salt though :)). My father ordered the Sea Bass and said it was a tad bit dry but it was very good. For dessert we ordered the Butter Cake, which was huge but very delicious. I also got a complimentary desert for my birthday, which was very nice. The service was A+ and although I forgot the name of our server, he was very nice and we chatted about our college experiences. Overall, highly recommend and I don't regret spending my birthday dinner there!",

        "text": "My wife and I came here for Valentine's Day. It started off with good service, until our entree came. After we hade portioned the sides, I noticed there was a 'made in China' tag that had been deep fried into our brussel sprouts. The waiter never came over to check after the food was served, so I had to flag him down. He apologized and took them back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, we cut into the steak. We ordered medium and it came out raw. I knew it was raw, despite the darkness in the restaurant. I took my phone out and used the flash light. It was definitely raw. I had to flag him down again. They took the cut up $85 steak back and threw it back in the oven, brought it out, and didn't even come back to check if the temp was good. A manager never came out and apologized. I've never had an experience like this at a restaurant of this supposed caliber. It doesn't matter what grade of meat you have if you can't cook it. As we were leaving, I asked to speak with the manager. He had just walked up. He said he was sorry and that no one had alerted him. He gave me his card and said to call if we came back. I honestly, don't care to go back. We would've been better off going to Little Alley. At least the server and manager are present and ask if everything was good there.  I expected better customer service and food for the price point.\n\nAdditionally, the restaurant did not follow proper social distancing guidelines. The guy next to us (within 4 feet of our table) proceeded to pull his chair around to where he was within 2 feet of our table.",

The lobster and shrimp bisque had hood amount of protein but salty. Filet cooked Pittsburgh style (little salt with butter cooked at 1700 degrees) was the best steak I ever had. Not too pretty on the outside at that heat but it was cooked perfectly and very juicy. All the side we're good, my favorite was the mushrooms. Service was great, attentive and prompt. Very classy with live music. Only downside was the people smoking cigars at the bar. This place became one of my favorites.",

We never want to turn guests away but if we do not have the availability for the a large group, we cannot accommodate. Alex did his best to seat you at a later time. In the future, since reservations for 8+ are not able to be made online, please call us for availability. Thank you for understanding, we wish you a happy holidays.",

We made reservations online. This was our first time eating here we were celebrating our 9 year anniversary. \n\nI ordered a salad to start and we both ordered steaks with creamy spinach and southwestern corn. The steaks were absolutely amazing!!! They didn't require any sauce whatsoever. Since it was our anniversary they gave us a dessert on the house it was a warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. That was the best cookie I've ever eaten and I don't like chocolate. \n\nThe only thing that I did not like about the restaurant was the smoking of the cigars. I don't like to be around smoke, I don't smoke. It was annoying to have to eat with the smell of smoke. It was worse that when I got home my clothes and hair smelled like it.

There should have been no reason for the delay in receiving your meal. As for your incorrect steak temperature, we broiled all our steaks pittsburgh-style on a 1700 degree broiler that creates a charred outside, and as noted on our menu, we don't recommend cooking temperatures from medium well and above. That was likely the issue. Despite this recent experience, we know we can still wow you and hope you'll give us another chance.",

We arrived 10 mins before the order 2 in our party. They said it's fine your table isn't ready anyway we will text you.  We go to the bar and our friends arrive. Mind you they gave the reservation name as well when they got there.  We are sitting at the bar for well over an hour and we go ask what was going on and the manager says, \"oh we've been seating others before you because we didn't think your party was here yet.\" Did you not think to text us?? Since clearly that's what you said that you would do!!  Once we finally got seated the server comes over and is reaching all over us instead of walking around the table. Food finally comes out after forever and it's cold. You could clearly tell it had been sitting.  We mentioned when making the reservation that we were celebrating birthdays. That wasn't acknowledged but they made a big deal out of several birthdays around us.  This place is too expensive to give this type of service.  I won't be back!",

You do get a hearty amount on your plate for the price. The lump crab appetizer was unbelievably fresh. And the lump crab were actually lumps and not just small pieces . Well worth it. We went on a Saturday at 7:30 with a party of 8. We sat immediately  upon our walk in. We were celebrating a birthday locally however my party and I had a room at the W so our hotel service had a private car take us to the restaurant . The restaurant does however have valet service. Fun fact they do have a cigar menu within their drink menu. The live music, atmosphere and ambience was great. I will say it was  a little dark in the restaurant some of my party who wore glasses did use their phone light to read the menu. However the restaurant was overall a great experience. I will come back on a more intimate occasion, like a date or with a smaller party .",

I must admit that I was a little displeased with being sat outside, because it wasn't aesthetically pleasing for an upscale dining experience, BUT we were greeted by  our server, Nettie and she was AWESOME. Her southern accent and superb service set the tone for a wonderful evening. She explained in detail the menu and even suggested the most popular appetizers and we were not disappointed. Everything we ate was so fresh and delicious. We have been to several steakhouses, but none compared to the food at NY Prime. We were so impressed by the service and quality of food,that we rated it as #1 on our list of restaurants. We will definitely be making another trip to Atlanta to have dinner here again and we will make sure to request Nettie as our server. WONDERFUL DINING EXPERIENCE!!!!",

        "text": "This used to be my favorite steak house. It is unfortunate to have to give this review. The service and quality of food has certainly changed. We got there early before the normal rush, but this did not help the attentiveness of the server.  After a long wait at the table, our server finally came to greet us. It took a while but he eventually returned with our drinks and took our order.  The food quality was sub par compared to how I remember it before COVID. Prices were higher but I anticipated this due to current supply. I didn't anticipate the service to suffer. We did not see our server for the majority of the meal and when we did, we had to ask for our empty drinks to be replenished.  When it came time for the check, a dessert menu was not offered so we went ahead and accepted the check. We promptly gave our credit card and it wasn't for another 20 minutes (at the least) that our server returned with the receipt.  Based on this, My view of this restaurant has not made it high on my list to return.",

        "text": "My husband and I dined at New York Prime for the first time last night. Choosing New York Prime as the restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. It was truly a grand experience. The service was extremely exceptional, and attentive but we never felt rushed. I started with the Frosty Lemon Martini, their version of a lemon drop (I loved it). The hubby had the Johnny Walker Black straight up (he's a scotch man). I think they were being really nice because it was our anniversary because they gave him a full short ball of JWB. That's unheard of for 14 bucks. I love oysters, so of course we started with the Oysters Rockefeller. I've had better oysters but they were good. For my dinner I chose the bone-in ribeye, and hubby got the New York Strip. They pride themselves on being masters of charring, and they are. The steaks were beautifully charred, and my ribeyes flavor was excellent. The sides are shareable, and we chose the creamed spinach, and Southwest creamed corn. Again, everything was excellent. New York Prime is my new favorite steakhouse.",

If you are not familiar with the location, it's tucked away and difficult to find. \n\nI went on Valentines Day and was pleasantly surprised that we did not wait to be seated. The service was impeccable.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the choice of sides and appetizers. They did not serve the traditional seafood or truffle Mac & Cheese. Or any Mac & cheese for that matter. No potato Au Gratin. No crab cakes for an appetizer. The side I ordered was loaded baked potato and my man ordered French fries. Really, French fries with a $40 steak? So although the steak was good, I didn't enjoy the entire entree due to the selection of sides.\n\nNice steakhouse but will probably not return.",

The food had highs and lows. The fried lobster was so so bad. Breading tasted like chicken nugget batter from school lunch and the lobster itself had NO taste. Baked shrimp appetizer wasn't too bad, but someone in my party said it tasted like pool water. Oyster Rockefeller not bad either, but the spinach tasted like frozen spinach and not fresh spinach and the presentation on the rock salt was not a great choice at all. Crab cakes were impressive (all crab meat with no filling), but lacked soul. Sea bass, I was told is the best sea bass in the city! Can't go wrong with that, but don't get it with Brussels. They don't take the end off the Brussels sprouts, leaving them very chewy. Nothing special about those, but the other sides were good. Steak was superb and cooked to perfection. Oh! The bisque was amazing! But the soup being at the top of the list doesn't say much for the restaurant. I probably won't be back. So many restaurants in Atlanta that are so so good this one I may not repeat.",

Due to the previous reviews I was skeptical of this place but those people weren't even close to describing the restaurant and I'm so happy I went with my instincts and decided to ck.e anyways.",

Found free parking in a parking deck located adjacent to the building the restaurant is located in, so that was a plus. Have to knock it a star for the same reason as all the other reviews: the smoke. It being a small little place, they allow for cigar smoking and if just one patron is partaking, then you're inhaling. It was over-bearing and made my wife a little ill. I'm not sure why in this day in age a restaurant still allows for smoking, but Prime does, so be prepared!",

Ceasar salad was great. Had the bone in filet and it was cooked to perfection. The onion straws were also really tasty. Wife had the cheesy mash potatoes and again very good. And finally the dessert. Had the huge Chocolate tower with ice cream and 4 people ate from this dish but was really good. The service here is amazing and I will definitely return. The only reason I am giving it a 4 start is because this place allows smoking inside the restaurant. So at our table we could smell to much smoke which made my wife a little nausea. \nI will be back to this restaurant.",

The service was on point and even with our large party not a single glass went empty. The rest of Atlanta wishes they had this caliber wait staff. They were efficient and not obtrusive so we could talk and not be constantly interrupted like other places and every item came out exactly as requested. Then the meal...every item looked Instagram perfect when it appeared and was cooked spectacularly. I highly recommend their Old Fashioned from the cocktail menu and have now been ruined for life and will have to come back often.",
