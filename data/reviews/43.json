And a full bar for the alcoholics! It's a dim and intimate spot that gives off Victorian mansion vibes (lots of statues and pillars all around). It's perfect for a date spot.\n\nNo I'm not a coffee drinker by any means, but I hit up the coffee there is good. Now the cake, I can be here for that! I tried the apple crumb cheesecake and I got the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake. Both of them were fire! If you want to quiet setting to have some coffee and some dessert, or maybe a cocktail, I would definitely suggest this spot.",

I enjoyed the American breakfast, that came with a flaky croissant, eggs, bacon, and great breakfast potatoes. Filling and great quality!

We came in a large group but were able to be seated right away since we split into two small groups.\nMy girl friends and I enjoyed the spicy seafood dip and the mango arugula salad that we added cooked salmon on top. We each got a drink - johannes, alpine, oj and hot chocolate. Each drink was great. My only suggestion is that they melt the white chocolate in the alpine instead of putting cold chunks in there. It all falls to the bottom and you can't really enjoy it after that.\nThe spicy seafood dip was delicious and warm, as was the bread. We also enjoyed the salad, so refreshing. \nOverall a good place to visit. It just needs a little renovation / refresh soon!",

        "text": "I have previously given Cafe Intermezzo two 5 star ratings, one on Google and one here on Yelp. However, as of today I don't feel inclined to continue being a patron. I've had two bad experiences in the last few months. Around Christmas I went to the Alpharetta location for the 1st time and I felt the servers were cold and the cake I ordered (the pumpkin torte) was nooot good and overpriced. However, I didn't leave a review about this because I thought it was either a fluke or just that location. However, today I went back to the Midtown location as usual and I just was not pleased. \n\nLong story short, I had a horrid long day of traveling which resulted in me getting home 2-2.5 hours later than planned. I had flight delays, had to run through customs, all due to things out of my control. I had no time to eat during the day so my plan was to go to Cafe Intermezzo when I got home since I knew they were open until 1am. However, when I got back to ATL the Marta shuttle that was supposed to pick me up didn't show which resulted in me walking a few blocks home with a big bag of luggage. The ONLY reason this detail is relevant is because during my walk I called Cafe Intermezzo 3 times in hopes of placing a To Go order. No one answered any of my calls. But since most places are closed by 12am I was desperate so when I finally got home I rushed to my car to drive to Cafe Intermezzo to see if I could place the order there. I got there maybe at like 12:35. When I got to the bar the lady tells me the kitchen is closed as it closes 30 minutes before the restaurant. I informed her I had been calling them to place an order but no one picked up. Then I asked if there is anything already made I can order so they wouldn't have to cook anything. (I had a specific order in mind but I was sooo hungry I'd take anything). Anyhow, she asks the manager if there's anything they can offer me and the answer she received was No. So I just got a piece of cake and coffee since coffee usually helps suppress my appetite. When I got home to eat the strawberry torte cake it was dry! I had to separate the bread from the icing, warm it up for a few seconds, and drizzle some milk so it could be moist.\n\nTonight I wasted $17, my time, and ate food that was not in any way filling or tasty. I should have just gone to sleep hungry and tired instead of trying to eat. To be clear I understand me having a bad day of flight delays has no connection to CI. However, them missing 3 calls for me to place an order & them not doing anything to try to compensate is what is the issue. There wasn't even a sense of urgency in getting the coffee and cake that I did order. It was just weird. Also I suggest putting on your website the times the kitchen closes.",

We sat down and each ordered a drink a slice of cheesecake to share. The drinks took forever to show up and we had finished the cheesecake by the time they did but everything still tasted phenomenal! Service was also great. To drink, I got the espresso martini and it had to be one of the best espresso martinis I have had in a long time.

The dip itself was great, as was the bread that came with it. \n\nMy favorite part of the meal was probably the peaches and cream torte. The quality of the peaches were amazing and super fresh. While the torte was definitely very sweet and I couldn't finish most of it, it was great and I would definitely order again.\n\nThe cafe has plenty of dessert options on display. I am excited to come back soon! :)",

        "text": "We were in Midtown on a recent Saturday evening and decided to get something dessert-y and sweet - like cake, and we just happened to be driving right past Cafe Intermezzo, which we knew served great tasting cakes.\n\nWe found paid parking available in the large parking garage between Peachtree Street and Juniper Street, entering it off of 12th Street.  Cafe Intermezzo validates parking for 2 hours, so bring the ticket for parking into the restaurant for validation.\n\nCafe Intermezzo is located at the corner of 11th Street and Peachtree Street.  We were greeted immediately by the hostess who led us to a table in the indoor dining area where we could look out the windows facing Peachtree and people watch.  R and I both went back to the entrance area where cakes and cheesecakes were in the refrigerated display cases so that we could gawk at their delicious presentation and decide which cakes we were going to order slices from.\n\nOur very courteous server, who provided great customer service throughout the entire time we were there, came by to take our orders after we sat down.  We told him that we were only going to have cakes and I was going to drink water, since we'd been outside in the sun and were close to dehydration.  I ordered a slice of German Chocolate torte, and R ordered Strawberry Creme torte and an iced vanilla latte.  In a very short time the iced vanilla latte was served, followed by the tortes a few minutes later.  I loved the German Chocolate torte, which had a delicious richness to it and not too sweet.  R thought his Strawberry Creme torte and iced vanilla latte were great.\n\nI was very impressed with Gaybriel (the name on our receipt), our server.  He was absolutely great.  Even though he knew that we were there only for dessert, he still came by periodically to check on us, and was constantly refilling my water glass, and showed a fantastic overall level of service.\n\nNot only are there indoor dining areas, there is also an outdoor covered patio area, which is a great place to watch traffic and people going by.",

And the desserts are absolutely divine. Our frutti di bosco and cookies and cream cheesecake were so good and not incredibly sweet either, which was perfect for us. I'm not a huge fan of desserts that are so dense it makes you regret your life choices after you leave the restaurant. So Cafe Intermezzo was perfect :)\n\nI will say though, it got pretty crowded inside. There are a LOT of people who come inside to eat but just as many waiting to order by the display case.",

I typically opt for the Irish Coffee for something sweet, and finish it off with the spicy seafood dip - shrimp, scallops, crab, and garlic with a doughy baguette for dipping. In the 70's, people used to come here after a long night of disco dancing and I can totally see why. Intermezzo is Atlanta's gem, and I love collecting gems",

I got the intermezzo hot chocolate while my friend got the intermezzo cappuccino to drink. For food, I got the seafood crepe and she got the chicken croissant sandwich. \n\nThe hot chocolate was delicious and presented very prettily. The cappuccino was good, but presentation- not so much. The food, on the other hand, was way better! That crepe was perfection and I cleaned up my plate (which I normally don't). My friend loved her chicken salad also but that portion was big enough to have leftovers. \n\nI really liked this place. I will be back when I visit Atlanta next.",

Compare it to going to a busy bar with bartenders that act high and mighty if they don't know you type of vibe. \n\nSecond time here we just stopped by to grab a slice of cake to go, $12 and they asked for a tip... for slicing and bagging a slice of cake. Maybe that's why they had us wait 6 mins at the front of a busy front entrance... for a slice of cake. The icing on top was... well see the attached photo \n\nCake itself was, alright.

This time my husband and I had just finished watching The Great British Baking Show and were in the mood for sweets. \n\nLos Guidry's Thoughts and Recommendations:\n- Be prepared to wait. We came here on a Friday night and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. There were plenty of tables available but the restaurant was understaffed so it makes sense they couldn't seat everyone.\n- Frutti di Bosco! This was our favorite dessert. Light, fresh flavors, not too sweet and overall delicious. Highly recommend if you like fruit tarts.\n- Hot chocolate can be skipped. It was far too sweet for us. All we could taste was the sugar. \n- Naan and Lox! From the dinner menu this was our favorite item. We weren't looking for large plates since it was late at night and a big meal would be too heavy. This starter was absolutely delicious and plenty to share for 2.\n\nAny time I've been here I order the Tiramisu which is INCREDIBLE. I didn't order it this time but always recommend if coffee desserts are your thing. Overall Cafe Intermezzo continues to be a staple in Atlanta. It's whatever you make it- a fun night out with friends or a romantic date night with your SO.",

The Frutti di Bosco is flown in from Italy as well as the Tiramisu (currently out of stock while Bindi returns production to the traditional one we've served for decades).  Your comment about our hot chocolate is heard and will be addressed.  And, the Naan and Lox is quite yummy! It's a personal favorite of mine.  We have loved serving our guests the European-style coffeehouse experience for almost 43 years and look forward to many more.  Your patronage is very appreciated!!!

The bacon was amazing and my husband had a seafood crêpe. That was delicious. I had a peach martini that was not too sweet but light enough for a hot day. We had dessert there are there are a ton of cheesecake options and quite a few torte options. We had a coconut cream torte the cake was so moist. The filling was amazing and the frosting was sweet, but not overly so. My husband had a coffee drink that was vanilla ice cream with a double shot of espresso and whipped cream and he thoroughly enjoyed that. If and when we return to Atlanta, we will definitely be stopping here again. Our waitress Tina, and her colleague Damien we're both excellent and the host Jeff was the host with the most.",

        "text": "I come here every Sunday for brunch regardless of the heavy meditating I have to do prior. I just love the ambiance. I love the Bloody Mary's here even though you have to be prepared for them to come out after your food has already come out. This place is not for the impatient as you're lucky if your water comes out before your food. I put Tabasco on everything and although I ask for it I always end up wandering around the place to fetch it myself. But even with this - I keep coming for the vibes. Let me tell you why I will not be returning. \n\nAll of the above happened but THIS time my eggs Benedict came out wrong as a salmon Benedict instead and I was actually so stoked about this. I got to enjoy my Bloody Mary as my food was being fixed. Fortunately, I was a bit tipsy from this by the time I took a big ole bite into my eggs Benedict. Why? Because at this moment, I find myself on a beautiful day, sun shining, ambiance out the wiz, with a gooey string of raw egg white hanging about 3 inches out of my mouth. I'm embarrassed to say that I then slurp it up praying that it is extremely cohesive egg yolk and end up swallowing the translucent insides of a raw egg. On the upside, I have involuntarily checked the raw egg challenge off my bucket list. On the downside, I had to summon the courage to tell my waiter about this. \n\nI finish the confrontation off by saying please no need to tell the kitchen to remake it as the bloody Mary's and potatoes filled me up! At this point I'm planning on tipping the waiter more because I feel so bad he is having to deal with this. The news I receive next was enough to make the slimy whites come back up with vengeance. I receive the bill and was fully charged for RAW egg on a chilly English muffin. I summoned the courage to tell the waiter about this even with crippling social anxiety and was still charged. \n\nEveryone makes choices in life and I'm not sure I'm prepared to gamble paying for salmonellae again. I'll get salmonellae, but I sure would appreciate not paying for it.",

It was a little busy  and the staff member that took my order didn't seem to be that thrilled to be working so I didn't ask a lot of questions.  I ordered two pieces of the Oreo cheesecake and spent almost $27.  When I got home I realized that they slices were a lot smaller than in the past and both my husband and I thought it tasted not as good as the previous cheesecake we've had from there.  The cheesecake didn't have a lot of Oreo mixed in and just missed a bit of flavor.  Not sure exactly what it was but it just wasn't that great and this was a pretty mediocre experience for a place I've had some really good experiences.",

Then we got the mussels and it was perfectly seasoned and the sauce was very good. Probably will work with even pasta in that sauce. We also got the tortellini and added salmon.

        "text": "I've been to Cafe Intermezzo a handful of times and based on those experiences, I've found that it's a great place for cheesecake and dessert drinks. \n\nThe vibe is truly unlike anywhere else in Georgia. The patio is large (with windows that close up around it if it rains) with a European bistro vibe. While the outside is charming, the indoor seating option is intimate! I love that it's open late -- the perfect place to end a night! The service has always been top notch for me, and they have their own validated parking lot.\n\nThe best item(s) to get are the cheesecakes -- they have a wide range of flavors, all rich and delicious. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the cakes and tortes I've had. Some are great, others are dry or one dimensional. It seems like the quality varies. So, if you like cheesecake, definitely stick to those because you can't go wrong. The non-dessert options I've had (tortellini, spinach salad) have not been my favorite, especially at the price point. \n\nThe drinks are great. Their espresso martini is top 3 for me (!!!) Emphasis is on \"espresso\" rather than \"martini\" which is to say it's creamy and sweet instead of boozy. The Mexican Hot Chocolate is also amazing...so much whipped cream! Their iced coffee on its own is not my favorite, compared to others in the area. The sugar is just packet cane sugar which didn't dissolve well and the flavor was lacking. \n\nOverall, highly recommend if you're in the area and looking for dessert after dinner (or just craving cheesecake at midnight...) It's worthy of the hype if you know what to get!",

        "text": "Not the one to leave a bad review but here I am, was really looking forward to trying some coffee from here, we are staying at a nearby hotel and it's always busy so we figured we just pick up some drinks to go, I purchased a regular iced vanilla latte over the phone and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes which it was. I got my latte, but it did not taste like a latte at all. It tasted more like a super sweet chocolate milk which I was not looking for at all. \nThe ambience and atmosphere appears to be really nice but if they don't have good quality products to back it up, I will always leave disappointed. \nI am open to trying again in the near future and hopefully I have a better experience. I would be happy to revise this review. If the drinks I order next time are more on par for midtown Atlanta.",

We decided to wait at the restaurant which is likely why they gave us a table in just 10 mins, so props for that. \nOur waitress was really friendly but did not know about allergy info and had to keep going back to check. We ordered 2 hot chocolates since we've had them previously and remembered the taste being fantastic. This time it tasted as if it was store bought powder with milk. The red velvet was okay - nothing special. \nThe atmosphere is really nice and warm as well as the service.\nParking is validated at the garage.",

Maybe our baristas made it incorrectly?  I'll definitely look in to it to make sure they are following the recipe. Thank you for letting us know about this.\nI also oversee our bakery - might you have a suggestion about our Red Velvet Torte?
