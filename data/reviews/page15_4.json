It was fine, taste like chicken (just kidding, it was as advertised. awesome).   \n\nThis was an early birthday dinner for yours truly.  We splurged on the whole\nFish dinner.  We chose the Atlantic char. The appetizers of Greek spreads-authentic and creative.  Salad and eggplant were nicely prepared.   The fish was nicely grilled.  \n\nWine list was good, and very reasonable.  \n\nDefinitely recommended.",

The spanakopita and lamb pie were fresh, flaky, and delicious. Octopus was the best we've ever had. Red beets in the beet salad were sour and not edible.

Because I help my group eat all of it! I wish I could remember the meal that I had but it was the most delicate and airy fish that I had. The sauce that surrounded the fish was delicious and it was paired well with the fish. The sweet white wine was nice and chilled. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice, warm and inviting. It was good for a team dinner or intimate evening with your significant other. \n\nThe waitress was very well versed of the food andd wine.

For tonight's meal we ordered the lamb pie (must have), scallops, and lobster for appetizers. We then ordered the Lamp Chops cooked Medium Rare (cooked to perfection) for main entree. Alex, our waitress was beyond amazing, not to mention her bottle service is extremely professional and graceful. All thanks to Alex, we will be seeing her again. We had a wonderful experience.

        "text": "I've been to Kyma plenty of times now and each experience has been quite different. My last visit was quite disappointing service-wise, our server Kylene just kind of forgot about us. We had to ask for bread where it is usually brought to the table without asking, our drinks took forever, and it took her a while to take our order. She said she had a big table that kept her busy. Really?? What kind of an excuse is this? If you are in the weeds, don't take an additional table. Why would I care about her other tables. If I go out, I expect excellent service no matter what.\n\nThat said, the food here is good, if a bit too heavy on the oil. But that's Greek, I get it.\nThey have two different food menus, one for the dining room, one for the bar. I'd recommend asking for both as there is a difference in price but not the size (which is strange). The waitress first said that the bar menu offers smaller portions but then when our items were brought to the table, she said the portions are actually the same.\n\nHere are some of the menu items I've tried here through my visits. \n\nApps: \n- \"Kyma's Been off the Menu for Years, Non-Stop-Ordered\" Baby Back Pork Ribs - excellent. Fall-off-the bone tender deliciousness;\n- Truffled Veal Sweetbread Nuggets \"Professionally Cooked the Way They Should Be\" - these were a-ok, we ordered sauce on the side and with quinoa salad (the salad was too citrus-y for my taste);\n- Calamari pasta - this dish had a strange consistency and texture, not my favorite;\n- Braised lamb cheeks - good but not as tender as ribs and quite fatty;\n- grilled octopus - some of the best in Atlanta.\n\nDishes:\n- Giant prawns  - perfectly cooked and very juicy;\n- Lamb 3 ways - I expected it to be more tender and juicy.\n\nThey have a very well stocked bar and a small patio although the outside tables are tiny if you plan on eating al fresco.\n\nOverall: if you like greek food, you will like this place.",

        "text": "My husband and I decided to celebrate our anniversary dinner here. After valet parking we were warmly welcomed and seated. Our waiter took some commerative pictures of our special night which we appreciated.\n\nThe two of us wanted to share the sea bass. After reading reviews that the fish came with the head and tail on I politely asked if they could be removed. Our waiter told us yes and we could have the filet portion. They had a special appetizer that night which was soft shelled crab that came with cabbage.slaw. It was so good you could eat the whole thing. We were also served bread with olive oil dip prior to our main course.\n\nWe were shown the fish up front that is flown in daily and what is used to prepare the dishes.\nThey even identified some of them for us.\n\nOur Greek bass was served as we requested so we split it and had a side of kale to go with it. The bass was delicious except while eating I hit two fish bones, one a bit large. I brought this matter to our waiter's attention. He brought the manager over who offered to make us another one but to expect an occasional bone or two. They would do their best to skin it. As an apology they gave us a Greek salad on the house.\n\nWe got fresh dishes and utensils when our 2nd bass came out. This one was completely boneless and we throughly loved it.  They brought out the dessert menu but we were too full from eating nearly two of the bass so we declined. As a surprise they brought out delicious baklava and pistachio ice cream with nuts as an anniversary dessert. It was just enough we could handle and this baklava was excellent.\n\nI am grateful for the staff of Kaya who made things right for us. My true rating would be 4 1/2. Would definitely recommend if you want a Greek Mediterranean dinner.",

My husband ordered genuine snapper with brusse sprouts (good). As for drinks, I am convinced after both my visit to Greece several times and here that they cannot make red wine like Italian can and they shouldn't be charging an arm and leg for it --(mine was $15 per glass and I've tasted much better elsewhere). The ambiance is great with white columns and blue star lit sky. The waiters seems a bit over the top and pushy. I would return for grilled octopus anytime",

We sat at the bar waiting while a rude bar staff kept reminding us that two seats at the bar were reserved.  Once seated outdoors the cushions were wet from the rain, I asked for another seat, the hostess attempted to flip the cushions over and they were still wet.   I went to the hostess stand to ask to be moved inside but there was no one there so I asked miss rude barstaff and she told me to tell the hostess I POINTED THAT IT WAS EMPTY!   By 7:30 we were lingering around the bar watching people get seated and the \"reserved\" spot still empty (don't they only have a 10min wait).   The manager shows up and is apologetic but has no resolution.  By 8p we were finally seated our waitstaff Andrew was awesome with recommendations and service and the manager comped our drinks for the inconvenience.",

        "text": "This is been a great place that we keep returning to since I've moved here. We are always so pleased with our order and everything taste great.\n\nThe grilled octopus is always cooked perfectly. But on this last visit I feel like the portions did get a little bit smaller and we were informed that the chef had just recently updated the menu. I don't know if he updated the menu for the price or the portion size since I don't remember how much it was before but it was definitely a smaller portion that were used to.\n\nThe steam muscles are always another favorite of ours. Never overcooked and very tasty! The toasted bread that it comes with is just perfect for dipping to the sauce.\n\nFor the main courses we've tried many different dishes. Our favorite go to is usually the lobster pasta, the lobster is always very sweet and succulent and they come out showing you the fresh grilled lobster before taking it back to just take the meat out and making your pasta. The portion of pasta maybe a little bit small so I don't think it would satisfy someone with a larger appetite.\n\nThe lamb chops here were perfectly cooked and well seasoned. One of the few places that I'll have lamb chops because I know it'll always be cooked right.\n\nI've also had the dinner entrée prawns and as delicious as they were however for a main entree it only came with 4 shrimp on tomato sauce. I think it needs another component or some starch to make it more of a meal than comparable to an appetizer. \n\nFor dessert, on our first visit we ordered three full-size desserts to share. The donuts we ordered a half order but that was our least favorite dessert. It's just fried dough balls soaked in a syrup that made it very sweet and had honey on top as well. Our two favorite desserts here is the baklava and especially the blueberry dessert in Filo dough that's perfectly light and not too sweet of a dessert. \n\nOverall this is a place that usually has solid food once you know what to order. This is a place we keep coming back and back and will always bring visitors to you. The ambience is very nice and the staff is always been great to us.",

We decided to try all of the main mezes that everyone suggests first like the grilled octopus, tzatziki spread, & spicy lamb pie. However, my favorite items on the list were the scallops & foie, which are Maine diver scallops, seared foie gras, fall squash, almond & the Calamari pasta, which are thinly sliced and sautéed Maine calamari, Mediterranean vegetables. Truly delicious. I will come back for those two dishes alone. I would not suggest the roasted oysters. The taste was very strong. Overall, we had a great night. The only flaw was that my boyfriend was annoyed by the loud European techno music in the background the entire night.",

        "text": "Summary:  A bit pricey, but worth the coin and the time.  If they can't fit you in the dining room, they have a very capable bar with a full menu and friendly staff.\n\nRoom:  Khyma is just a tiny bit darker than I'd prefer, but it does have that kind of lighting that makes you look good.  The surroundings are definitely \"Greek\" and if you've ever been to Greece you'll notice that sensibility has carried over.  It's got high ceilings and is very comfortable. My only quibble was that the music was a little loud on our most recent visit, but not overly so.\n\nService:  We sat at the bar and the service was terrific.  Our bartender was very helpful in choosing wines for us (we tasted several before settling on two we liked very much) and he struck the right balance of being there when we needed him and absent when we didn't.  \n\nFood:  This is where Kyma really shines.  I'm sure they have great non-fish dishes but the fish there is SO GOOD that we just can't bring ourselves to order anything else.  We had a dorado and an Arctic char that were both prepared grilled with just a minimalist touch. The dorade had a caper butter sauce and the char was grilled with olive oil and herbs.  You have to be VERY confident in the freshness of your fish to serve them that plainly because the fish is going to shine through.  In Kyma's case, it shined brilliantly.\n\nValue:  Like I said, it is a bit pricey with many fish dishes running about $40-43 per pound (you get less than a pound so the net is in the low $30's) and single glasses of wine are mostly $12-16, but the quality is outstanding and there are lots of appetizers that are much less expensive and very filling.  We could have had 2-3 appetizers each and been nicely full but, like I said, they just do SUCH a good job with their fish...  Overall we feel it's a good value and worth 4 stars, bordering on 5.",

Our server was barely eighteen, a recent high school graduate, therefore he was unable to serve us a drink and had to tag someone of age to help.  Took 30 minutes to get our first drink and even longer to get the second one....he forgot.  The bread which we had to ask for was stale and when we complained they said, we can bring \nyou more but it's all the same.  Tasted like it had been sliced yesterday morning.  Ordered beet salad but it had no greens, not even a tiny bit!  Food arrived way late and was not even warm so I can't blame how horrible it was on a heat lamp.  Server showed up before we were finished dinner with a dessert menu which by the way was the highlight of the evening.  $370 later we left.  Bad bad bad!  No wonder the Buckhead Life restaurants are a shrinking presence in Atlanta dining arena.  Sorry for Pano if this is the best this group has to offer.  There are too many good places to eat in the ATL to accept mediocre!  Never again.",

        "text": "This our first time to Kyma.  I took the family for my wife's bday.    \n\nI found that there were some hit and misses.     I get it, its high end fancy Greek Food and not what we have come to expect at most places, which are massive portions of ok heavy and sometimes greasy food.   Small plates we ordered were  The Four Spreads ( Eggplant, Hummus, Red Pepper, Tapenade all delish   but not enough bread. Boo, an extra pita with a $14 dip spread for $5!?! ), Spanokopita ( very good and close to my Yiaya's), Lamb Pie ( a Stunner),  Grilled Octopus ( another hit!)  So overall we are impressed with the flavors and presentation.    Plates tend to come out as they are ready and not all at once.    \n\nEntrees we ordered- Lamb Shank, Lamb Pasta,  Prawns, Lobster Pasta, Lamb Chops.   All were very good and there were no complaints.  Or leftovers..... The Beet Salad my wife ordered came after the entree was served.   Dessert were Loukoumades (donuts) and baklava rolls.    The Loukoumades were like  hot just out of the fryer and couldnt have been better.  The baklava was meh at best.  The pistachio ice cream was fantastic. \n\nOverall we really enjoyed the food.  Quite Pricey, small portions but in the end we were stuffed and would go back.  The food was that good.  However we did have some misses that made we want to rate it 3 stars.  \n\n I felt the service was more akin to that of fast casual restaurant than a fine dining establishment.   We enjoyed the pace of the night, but I felt things like our waiter leading us through the menu would have helped.   How many sides will we need?  You have fish on the menu - anything special we should try?    I am sure we missed things that we should have tried.    He was young and seemed a bit inexperienced for this level of dining.     \n\nThere are also some very pretty tables, we (5) were seated by the kitchen door.  :-|",

        "text": "Kyma is one of those establishments that attract and typically host old money. It gives off that vibe from the valet to the host stand to the dining room.\n\nI took my boyfriend here for a late birthday dinner on a Friday night around 8:00pm, and it wasn't that busy. He had been craving whole fish for a while, and I thought Kyma would be the perfect restaurant for that craving. Of course, I was right!\n\nI had called ahead, and when we walked in, we were not greeted by the three people at the host stand. Instead, I had to approach them before a hostess spoke to us. She simply asked for our name and seated us without another word. It was a bit off-putting, but our server made up for the hostess's lack of enthusiasm.\n\nMy boyfriend started off with a jalapeño-based cocktail that he really enjoyed. We quickly ordered since we were starving!\n\nWe chose to do the tasting meal. As I was looking over the mzzses, I noticed the prawn saganaki was absent, but our server offered to ask the kitchen to make it for us. We also wanted the lavarti/ seabass, but they didn't have one fitting the portion size of the tasting menu. However, she was able to explain the tasting notes of the other fish.\n\nAnyways, our meal started off with the four spreads. As for mezzes, we opted for the ever popular house octopus, lamb pie, tomato salad, and the prawn saganaki. The lamb pie was our favorite. It wasn't gamey like lamb typically is. The tomato salad was disappointing since the heirloom tomatoes weren't being offered that night. We ended up getting the bream, which my boyfriend really enjoyed.\n\nTo end our meal, our server surprised my boyfriend with baklava and pistachio ice cream. Although I'm allergic to cinnamon, he said the flavor combination paired well. It was a nice to see that Kyma is one of those restaurants that recognizes special occasions!\n\nThe manager also checked on our table, which always makes me super happy. Kyla's one of those classic restaurants you can always count on.",

        "text": "One of the best seafood restaurants in Atlanta\nI went here for a dinner with husband on Wednesday night. Place was busy but not bad. We took uber so didn't really have to worry about parking but if you are going to drive then they have a valet parking. \nName of our server was Corey. Nice guy, good service. He was knowledgable about the menu and was able to answer any questions we had regarding the menu.\n\nWe started with meze ( appetizer). \nFirst meze was mariades which is basically a fried smelt served with a garlic, potato puree. It was delicious! I would I've it 9/10. \nSecond meze was grilled octopus. Although it's their famous dish I didn't like it as much as mariades. But I think that depends on a personal choice because my husband loved grilled octopus. I would still give it 9/10.\nThird appetizer was roasted oysters. Least favorite. I would give 3/10. Didn't like at all.\nFourth meze was baby calamari served with quinoa. Loved it! Would give 9/10.\nLast meze was tomato salad. Really good. The cheese used in the salad is dodani feta, which is an authentic greek feta cheese with a smooth creamy texture and a unique taste. 9/10 for salad. ( some ppl might not like it but personally I just love salads).\n\nThen came our fresh fish- rare greek sargos(White Sea bream). Heavenly! Although I was full I did manage to eat a bit because it was so good. The fish came with some kale,I forgot what it's called but it was really tasty. \n\nFor dessert we did kyma dessert tasting. We got to choose theee dessert samples - loukoumades, baklava with icecream and creamy rice pudding. Next time I would just order baklava with icecream. It was the best. \n\nIn short, it was a pleasant experience and I would go again.",

Because when we notified management of what was happening, they immediately stepped up, took care of the bill, provided free dessert / wine, and apologized immensely for the issues. Waiters make mistakes but management does not always respond with such a high level of customer service. We really appreciated that and will absolutely be back!",

        "text": "I thought about not posting this review but decided that I needed to share. \nSo my fellow Yelpers, I was initially excited to reserve a 'Mixology Experience' but sadly it was an ill executed afterthought... My original reservation was cancelled at the last minute b/c of a media presentation.  Then I asked for a reschedule on 12/18. As we all know with COVID any planned time away from home for an experience is a bit of excitement for us all.  So we were excited for our experience!  So we arrived for our 6pm reservation and mentioned that we were there for our previously reserved mixology experience. There were lots of blank stares followed by the Assistant Manager walking away for a very long time (7+ minutes).  When she came back she said that she would 'accommodate' us.  How rude?  She placed at a table in the bar area...so we continued to wait...As the time grew, I grew more frustrated and even more disappointed.  Guys I'm a buckhead lifer - I dined over the years as Panos and Paul's, Chops, Bones, KYMA etc.  THIS was not a buckhead life experience.  So we are still waiting... I asked for the manager and shared my frustration and disappointment with him.  Mostly what I shared is that ALL experiences outside the home are SPECIAL as we are still in the middle of a pandemic. So, SERVICE is key! Make sure your front of the house staff talks to your marking staff to ensure this doesn't happen to any other diners and or cancel the experience offering since you're not prepared to execute it very well.  We ended up having an okay experience but i won't be back any time soon.",

        "text": "I'm surprised I don't eat here more often considering how much I love seafood & Greek fare!! It's been a mainstay on the Buckhead restaurant scene since 2001, but I often overlooked Kyma. Not anymore! \n\nAside from the food, one of the things I love about this place is the decor and ambiance. Although it's slightly dated by today's standards, it's designed to be reminiscent of what else, Greece. Crisp white and deep blue hues impart a classy, sexy and tranquil vibe. Be sure to look up as you enter to see the starry ceiling. And you can't miss the focal point of the entryway - a fresh fish display. \n\nI prefer the bar dining area over the main dining room - it has more charm. There are a few cute, intimate candlelit tables perfect for two. Larger tables are also available in this area, as well as patio seating. \n\nOur Greek server expertly guided us through the menu. We started with the octopus ($12.50), hailed as \"the reason Atlanta eats octopus.\" I was reluctant to order this because I remember it being very tough & chewy elsewhere, but with such a lofty claim, I figured I had to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did! The tangy sauce & pickled red onions are what made the difference to me - the flavors popped! It was a little chewy, but octopus doesn't really lend itself to being tenderized. The texture didn't stop us from fighting over the last bite! \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the halibut ($30) with leeks and a mussel garlic emulsion. The dish arrived beautifully presented with two perfectly cooked filets perched atop the leek ragout. The flavor was very mild and fresh. It didn't have much seasoning but I added some lemon juice to jazz it up. I enjoyed it, but I probably would've liked it better without the mussel emulsion. Just a personal preference. \n\nMy guest has the sargos (striped sea bream), which came with the whole head & fin still intact. It didn't faze him, but I'm just not a fan of feeling like I'm doing an autopsy on my dinner! And for those who don't like food that stares back, you can order it with the head removed. After trying my halibut though, he said I ordered better. I love when that happens! \n\nThere were tons of other things I wanted to try, but I'll have to wait until the next time!",

        "text": "I have been to Kyma previously, around 5-6 years ago, and went tonight as part of the Buckhead Dine Around summer. We were very disappointed in not only the service, but the lackluster food. \n\nOur server never once explained anything on the menu. He was also not very present, we had to flag him down to order drinks and our food.\n\nMy husband got the lamb shanks, which were over cooked but still good. I got the lobster pasta, which while it did say there were chili flakes on it on the menu, it was almost not edible because it was so spicy. I can handle a bit of spice, but my husband and I ended up switching plates as I could barely eat the pasta. I wished the server warned me that it was very spicy. \n\nWhen we asked to see a dessert menu, again we were given the menu and no explanation as to what the server might recommend. We passed on dessert and ended up getting after dinner drinks and dessert elsewhere instead. We requested our check and put our dine around card in. When we got the check back without the next card in it, we had to flag down the server who then told us someone else would bring it. \n\nOverall, we were really just disappointed in the service. To spend over $100 (after a gift card discount) on lackluster food and service, I most likely will be switching out my dine around card to a different restaurant next year. \n\nThe two stars I am giving is due to the great bus-boy service (my water glass was never empty and they were very kind), good valet, and overall a nice atmosphere at the restaurant itself.",

        "text": "Honestly I'm not even sure where to begin. I have been to kyma with my family for many years, but it's been about 4 years since I've been, up until yesterday. My boyfriend and I had a reservation at 7:30pm. We arrived at 6:53pm to a fairly empty restaurant and asked to be seated. The hostess said she couldn't seat us until closer to our allotted time, totally fine. She told us to wait at the bar, you would think when our time came she would come and grab us, but she was clueless so I knew to keep watching the time. So at 7:30pm we go up to her to get seated, table isn't ready so we wait a few minutes, meanwhile there are plenty of open tables. \n\nOkay- so we finally sit. A lady comes up and asks for our drink orders, my boyfriend was in the bathroom so I got rose. Then 10 minutes pass and a guy comes up and asks for our drink orders, i said I already ordered through her, but my boyfriend will have a beer. We also ordered the olive spread, and 2 orders of 6 oysters. At this point it's about 7:45pm. The guy told us we can do 6 and 6, but on separate orders, they don't do 12, totally fine. \n\nNext- the girl waitress comes back with my drink and asks us if we want apps. At this point I was frustrated so I said can you two please communicate? He just asked us that and we told him. She apologized and said she would talk to him.\n\n30 minutes pass- no beer, no apps. I asked the boy pouring water for the manager, I watched him do absolutely nothing and proceed to walk around. I found the manager myself and I said I need to talk to you, i also asked your employee to grab you and he didn't. \n\nThe manager proceeds to tell me everything from then on would be perfect. It was no where near. I see him grab our guy waiter and speak to him, so the guy comes over. At this point it is almost 8:15pm.\n\nThe guy returns and said I just put in your order, 2 of each type of oysters to amount to 4, and the spread. The beer is coming. THAT WHOLE TIME HE NEVER PUT IN OUR ORDER!!!!!!\n\nThe beer is brought out at 8:20pm, almost an hour after we sat down. The spread is brought out, we ordered the olive spread, the assortment spread with a 12 dollar price difference was brought out. Not what we ordered. \n\nFinally the manager comes over and says they like to tag team tables, and that our waiter is new and there's 2 different menus and he's learning. \n\nIt's almost 8:30pm, no oysters, no entree order taken. We get up and leave.\n\nWe check this morning to write a review and the manager cancelled my boyfriends reservation on open table so he wasn't able to review it. \n\nHonestly I am shocked and appalled, 0/10 experience, will not be returning.",

It was delicious.\n-dessert sampler: great way to try 3 bite-sized desserts without the full portions",

Went with the lamb chops which looked pretty but they over did it with seasoning and salt.. ugh. The kicker?!

This is one of the few places (with the exception of Chinese restaurants) that serve whole fish with the bones and head and eyeballs and all haha. You can also order fish without the bone, but what would be the fun in that?? \n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the octopus... very delicious and comes in big chunks without the tentacles. For those of you that are scared to try octupus, don't be, it basically just tastes like chicken :P For entrees, we ordered the lamb shank (I'm not usually a huge fan of lamb but this was seasoned just right so it wasn't too gamey) and whole branzino (SO tender and yummy but be careful of the tiny bones!! Also very very pricey). \n\nThe atmosphere is romantic and very nice/fancy, perfect for a special date night or a business dinner. Parking is valet only, and service is great!",

The lamb pie was not at all overrated and I can see how that was the dish that beat Bobby Flay. We also had the pink snapper and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Dessert was also wonderful. \n\nDrinks: We had the Morpheus and it was sweet, floral, and delicious. 10/10 recommend. \n\nService: Our server was wonderful and was spot on with all of his recommendations.",

Kinda cool seeing all the fresh fish they offer in the cooler right off the main entrance.\nFor appetizers, we really enjoyed the four spreads they let you sample.  The red pepper one was our favorite. The octopus was good but my husband thought it was a bit overcooked.  The ribs were tasty, lots of seasoning.\nWe shared the whole red snapper.  It was huge, very expensive,  and very fresh.  My husband totally enjoyed it.  It did take a long time to prepare so be prepared for the wait.  We also tried the tasting dessert...the donuts were amazing.\nWe had a good meal here but be prepared for the long prep time and very expensive cost.  Also, just a word to the staff...in their effort to be efficient and keep the table cleared during our long wait, they swooped by and took our appetizers before we were finished.

        "text": "We have been going to Kyma for more than 10 years, and it used to be one of our favorite restaurant. Sadly, our last meal there left a lot to be desired. They have expanded the outdoor seating and we were seated practically in the parking lot with the sounds of passing traffic and a view of a giant billboard. Service was incredibly slow and appetizers arrived out of sequence. The recipe for the stuffed grape leaves (one of our previous favorites) seems to have changed and the current version is bland with an off putting texture. The whole Lavraki (also always a standout dish in the past) was bland and not particularly light and flaky. A truly disappointing experience-we won't be going back.",

We started with the oysters for an appetizer. The oysters tasted a little fishy and were mediocre. However, the skatefish was soooo scrumptious along with the lobster pasta. The server was attentive and friendly. In sum, the experience was memorable and we will return to try other dishes.",

The service is impeccable and the food is to match. \n\nThe octopus is the best thing on the menu, and the best in the city. The pickled red onions make the dish. Slop up the sauce with the bread. The for the entree I always get the arctic char plate. I didn't even know this fish existed until Kyma and now I can't even eat basic salmon anymore. Char is my new go to. \n\nMake sure to save room for dessert because the Greek doughnuts are a must have. A full order comes with a lot so we usually get the sampler with baklava and another dessert. Perfect amount.",

Great food, and more importantly service that was just as great. Started off with some cocktails and half priced bottle of wine (Sunday's) and octopus! (It's a must for sure!) got to taste fish AND steak during dinner and ended the night with some fab bread pudding.",
