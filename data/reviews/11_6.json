All the while the manager was at the bar taking a shot with a group of ladies. Also they used paper menus and mine were dirty and stained with food which is too be expected at a restaurant so why not use a QR code or wipeable material?",

        "text": "We had the worse service ever. Made reservation  for my son's 10th birthday, ordered the pinata for him. We got seated and ordered our drinks, which at one point i wanted to stand up and get them from the bar, that's how long we waited for them. We ordered food and that was brought out by the kitchen staff and it was very quick. After we ate, we were ready for another drink but nobody check on us, how the food was nor if we need anything. Then i realize the pinata is going to come to surprise my son but there were dirty dishes and glasses all over the table, so i collected all the dishes and put it to the side so that the waiter has place to put the pinata. He came with it mumbled happy birthday put it on the table and took the dishes and left. He legit came 1 minute later with the check that nobody asked him for. Mind you we wanted to order more drinks but nothing. We were in the restaurant not even kidding 50 minutes total. I will never go back.",
