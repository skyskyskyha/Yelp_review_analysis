        "text": "I would be lying if I say that I don't love a good bowl of ramen. This place not only has great ramen but a good atmosphere/aesthetics. I visited on a Friday night and I must say it was definitely crowded to say the least. The hostess was friendly and helpful we were seated within minutes. In my book that's always a good sign. Our server came over and introduced himself. For appetizer, I got the seaweed salad and my main meal was the spicy chicken ramen. Whew, honestly I love the ramen because it's packed with tons of flavor. You can add additional toppings if you like however that can rank up in price. For extra flavor I added some minced garlic and it hit the spot. Lastly, to me the broth wasn't unbearably hot but just a little spicy. I like to add extra spice to mine which brings all the flavors together. Can't wait to come back.",

Parking was easy. \nInside I was surprised to see how many people were dining, considering how early it was. There was plenty of seating and the bartender who served us was super nice.\nI had the Tonkotsu Black ramen with a little heat added. Mom had the chicken ramen. Mine was superb. Very flavorful - lots of yummy stuff in it. The seasoned egg was delicious. I also loved the fried onion and garlic chips added for flavor. The portions were plenty for a meal and prices were fair for what you get. \nI will definitely be back again one of these days. Definitely worth checking out",

The ramen dishes were generally good. The broth was complex and the proportions of noodles to toppings to broth was perfect, that said the spicy bowls were not at all spicy (the server never asked our preferred spice level).",

The pork chashu buns were fatty and crispy on the outside and so savory, and the little veggies in the fluffy bun cut through and balanced that richness. The pork yuzu shio was rich but balanced with the yuzu flavor and citrus that really shown through the broth. The shrimp wontons were so juicy and paired so well with the richness and creaminess of the broth. Our waiter Ian was very sweet and attentive, I hope to have him again if I stop by!

They have a bar area, indoor seating, tables at a ramen bar area, and patio seating as well (it's pretty in closed though). They have some TVs there at the bar if you wanted to check out a game. It's not set up like a sports bar so don't expect them wall to wall \n\nI sat at the bar. The bar was not particularly busy but it looked like the bartender was doubling as a server and busser so he took a while to get to me. Not his fault though, I totally get that. \n\nI had the octopus balls and the tonkotsu black (with brussel sprouts).",

I came with three people and we all ordered the same thing and had a different take on it. \n\nI loved my bowl- the egg was perfect, the greens added the perfect amount of salt and overall the broth was garlicky and soothing to my soul. The meat was flavorful and tender and the place was overall clean with trendy decor. \n\nMy two friends I came with felt that the seaweed added to much of an ocean flavor to the bowl aand the garlic made the bowl a bit spicy for one and the other felt that it wasn't spicy enough- thankfully they have spices you can add to your personal preference. \n\nThe noodle thickness was perfect and overall would eat her everyday if I could.",

        "text": "As someone who has been to Japan and tasted ramen over there, I fully admit, I can be a bit snobby or hard to please about ramen back here in the US. (I sound so pretentious right now don't worry I know haha). Saying this, this was the tastiest ramen I have eaten in awhile. My family eats here often and they decided to take me for the first time and I loved it. They offer delicious vegetarian options that I was excited to try.\n\nI ordered the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen and added a Marinated Egg ($15.80). My step-mother is also vegetarian and got the Flying Vegan Harvest Ramen and added a Marinated Egg as well ($16.80). She also ordered the Impossible Gyoza ($9.50) for the table. My ramen was so creamy and I felt like it had a great depth of flavor. I tried my step-mother's order as well and it was also was good. It had more of an earthy flavor. However, I still think that my ramen was superior. If you love creamy ramen you have to try it. I was also pleasantly surprised by the Impossible Gyoza. I did not know what to expect, however it was crispy and the filling was seasoned very well with lots of ginger. No one was missing the meat at all. I would definitely order this again as well.\n\nThe ambience inside was very comforting. I love when places have windows to the kitchen so that you can see the food being made. We came in close to closing time and the staff were very accommodating and patient as well.",

A little spicier than normal but still so good. The edamame was good as well & the vegan gyoza were pretty good. Food was wonderful like usual. \n\nMy one complaint is that our server seemed to have forgotten that he had a table(s?) & after the food was brought out, he did not check on us even once. I had to flag down a different server to bring our check out since ours was busy taking to go orders. We'd been waiting for quite some time for him to come bring it & you could tell we'd been done eating for quite some time too (well over 15 minutes). \n\nI prefer the service in Sandy Springs but no complaints on the food!",

Be aware that they don't take reservations, so expect a little bit of a wait. \n\nI love the shrimp tempura as an appetizer. The shrimp is perfectly crispy and the spicy mayo on the top is so flavorful. My favorite ramen on the menu is the Tonkotsu spicy. I usually get it spicy and add some corn and garlic and hot for some more flavor, but I love the texture and flavor of the pork and the broth. I think I could eat that soup every day of my life. My mom is a vegetarian and she LOVES the spicy creamy vegan extra spicy. \n\nDefinitely, definitely recommend Jinya!",

Every bite was a burst of flavor and I couldn't help but close my eyes and savor each moment. (I know this sounds dramatic, but I'm 100% serious. I don't play around when it comes to food.)\n\nMy mom ordered a vegan option on the menu and, as someone who loves meat, she absolutely loved the vegan dish.\n\nThe menu is well suited for a variety of dietary needs and they allow substitutions for almost all their dishes. \n\nThe service was also a 10/10. As you are taken to your table, the entire staff welcomes you with a Japanese greeting. \n\nI definitely recommend, and I will definitely be returning to this establishment!",

It's all going to meet a level of quality that you're going to be pretty satisfied with I bet. This level of quality is also going to demand a higher cost in combination with the idea that ramen is getting consider fancier (and maybe I'm just not used to this inflation thing). That being said, I don't think it's going to completely blow you away, but I also think it's hard to find really good ramen in Atlanta that will tower over this restaurant either.",

I wasn't sure if ramen would be too messy, lots of splashing, slurping and noodles flying everywhere. Boy, was I wrong, the noodles and broth were so tasty. I was in between a pork and saw the special offer on the table which included a side of crispy chicken. It worked out really well. They charge a dollar extra if you ask for hot flavoring which was kind of annoying, but glad I got the extra spice. Only wish they had more craft brew on draft! I had a Basement POG which appeared to be the most locally craft for ATL. The pairing worked out. Definitely would recommend coming back during non peak hours to enjoy the restaurant dining experience.",

        "text": "Make reservations. It's not imperative but definitely a good idea for a weekend. We didn't make reservations and we only had to wait about 10 minutes, but I suspect if we had arrived earlier the wait would have been longer. The menu is what you would expect of a ramen bar. I really like the apps. The crispy chicken is actually tenders and delicious AF. I also really enjoyed the buns. We got the chef's special shrimp, but they also have impossible meat and pork. I definitely want to try the other apps next time. Not enough room in my belly for more than one app AND Ramen unfortunately. We sat at the bar, which was fine although I think I would've preferred a high top. I hate sitting next to who I'm talking to lol. I really like that they have meatless options on their menu, whether you're not eating meat for religious reasons or your diet doesn't include meat, it's definitely a great option to have. The food was delicious and very well made. Service was also excellent. Our server was Nicolas and he was very attentive and informative. We will definitely be back.",

I also had the tempura Brussel sprouts and they were good once I dropped them into some sort of soy sauce. We had a kid with us so they were very accommodating. I was low-key jealous of how much the kids meal provided. Overall, great experience and great food!",
