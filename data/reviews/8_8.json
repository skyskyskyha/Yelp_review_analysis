        "text": "In Atlanta for a long weekend and planned some dinner reservations. Found this place on the internet, came up quickly while searching & easy to get a reservation.\n\nThe reviews are great for this place. \nI was under impressed. It's not cute, it's a big loud restaurant that can't quite figure out what it is. Is it cool, classy, modern? It reminded me of a mall restaurant. Didn't feel special at all. Very surprised at all the positive reviews but perhaps geared for a younger crowd that thinks this is a fancy or cool place.  I didn't think it was that expensive. \nThere was a DJ at the entrance playing cover songs very loudly for a 6pm dinner.\nSections of the restaurant were elegant but other parts had tv's. \nThe severs were lovely, the food was meh and over salted. \n\nWould not recommend or return",

I usually hate whole wheat pasta but they packed so much flavor into this dish that I didn't mind. They added some great tasting peppers to the dish. Both spicy and flavorful. It was balanced well with the robiola cheese. Creamy and tasty. There were potatoes and carrots in to add a little more to the dish. The lamb was perfectly cooked and they gave you a good amount of it.\n\nIf you need a business lunch in the area I would come here for sure.",

        "text": "It's been a few years since I had the chance to revisit Mission + Market, but we came in tonight for what we hoped would be a delicious meal in a beautiful restaurant, and we couldn't have been happier to have done so. \n\nTuesdays are often quieter nights in the business, but we were pleased to arrive and be greeted by the host and manager.  We had a table away from the bar which was great for two teachers who needed a night to talk and decompress.  It's a beautiful restaurant - spacious with a clear view of an open kitchen, and the bar area has ample seating and dining space.  The walls around the bathroom are adorned with greenery - it's really lovely.   The tables are wide and sturdy, and the chairs were particularly comfortable.  \n\nWe sat with Olivia; she was a server who I would tell anyone to ask for.   I hadn't seen the menu in a while, so her knowledge of each dish's particulars helped me immensely.  We started with pellegrino and cocktails and hummus - an abundant plate of beautifully cut and arranged fresh veg over house made hummus finished with a drizzle of evoo and paired with warmed bread: a killer starter for two or more. I settled on the duck, pictured here, which was cooked to perfection and served over barley which gave the perfect contrast of hearty chew to the tender meat.  A pet peeve is when the skin of the breast is underdone and chewy - not here! A perfect sear and rendering left the skin crispy crunchy and the steak blissfully tender. The coconut curry was light, complimented the dish perfectly, and added the sweet spice that I needed.  Stellar. \n\nWe capped the meal with the bread pudding: a real diamond of a dish. Piping hot all the way through, tender to our forks but with a perfect crackling crunch on the crust, sitting in a pool of steaming creme anglais and finished with a scoop of utterly frozen ice cream which held its shape despite the heat of the pudding through some sort of wizardry that we did not understand but nevertheless loved.\n\nOlivia was attentive and kind, professional and courteous, and she made us feel really tip-top for having chosen to come in and dine there. Ask for her; she's a charmer.  This should be your Tuesday night spot (and parking was a breeze).",

        "text": "My wife and I had a great experience during our first visit to M+M for weekend brunch.  The staff was noticeably welcoming from start to finish (literally: the valet, hostess, bartender and waitress all warmly greeted us).  Our waitress was very attentive and I appreciated the chef accommodating my request for an egg white-only omelet (ham, gruyere and tomato, which was amazing).  My wife ordered a brunch classic in blueberry pancakes and they were some of the best we have ever tasted!  The restaurant itself was very nice, with a large airy space and modern decor; the large patio would be tempting on a nice day (too hot in August).  So, overall I highly recommend giving M+M a try if you're looking for a great brunch spot in Buckhead.",

        "text": "Mission & Market has earned themselves 2 satisfied customers. After my last review, the owner reacted out to my Google review to apologize and asked me to email him. I emailed Ian and he apologized once again and asked if I would give them another chance. So today my father and I went this evening.\nWe had a little trouble with the hostess stand who pretty much rushed my dad to close his bar tab so we could be seated. We thought that was rude but other than that our evening was enjoyable and went smoothly.\nOur server, Olivia, was pleasant and knowledgeable. She gave us a brief overview of the special, the menu, and her favorites. My dad decided on the 10oz steak and I opted for the lamb loin without bacon in my brussel sprouts. Olivia offered us bread service while we waited and I also ordered a glass of merlot. \nThe bread came to the table warm and steamy with a side of butter. Our meals came out shortly after, and they looked absolutely appetizing. \nThe steak and lamb were so tender and cooked to perfection. The steak was bigger than I expected it to be but it was a good portion size. Didn't care for the gnocchi that came with my dad's meal but the brussel sprouts were delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Stephen, the manager, stopped by our table and we had a nice chat with him. We told him how much we enjoyed everything except the gnocchi. He even had more brussel sprouts brought over since we didn't enjoy the gnocchi. My glass of merlot went perfectly with my lamb loin meal. \nI would like to thank Ian, Stephen, and Olivia for a great experience this second time around.",

This man is rude and a racist. \nFor a restaurant that seemed so nice, I am glad I will never get served there and will never handle racial judgement the way I did. A good occasion worthy to be celebrated became really bitter because of the rude and racial comments of this general manager. \nI know for sure, that in my right mind, I would never set my foot in this restaurant nor recommend it to my peers and family. \nHope you guys will work on your staff and learn to treat all people better.

I ignore the fact that I said the wait time was 0-10 minutes because this happened AFTER I clicked the button. \n\nI was with a group of 14 people and I do not know what happened but they did not have enough seats. Most of the party was already there so me and 2 other people literally waited for 30 minutes for them to add 3 seats to a table.\n\nAfter all that we didn't get offered a complimentary appetizer, drink, nothing. I simple sorry was all we got, after we had to speak to the manager about us waiting to be seated. By the time we got seated, all the bread and waiting items were basically all gone. I was extremely annoyed.\n\nSo you know I'm hungry by the time all of this was settled. So I decided to order the pasta because it's filling and a safe choice. Big mistake. The portion size was SO SMALL. It was literally ground meat and pasta. I was done within 5 minutes. Like it barely even put a dent in my stomach. I was honestly pissed it was $20! For what??? There was literally 10 noodles.\n\nThe only upside was that the waiter was really good. That's actually the only reason this rating is 2 stars. So shoutouts to him. But besides that, this place can definitely miss me.",

        "text": "Ambiance- check!  Service and food - nothing to write home about. \n\nMission Market opened last year to great anticipation and fanfare. The space is spectacular and a real stunner. Dark earth tones intertwine with a chic, modern decor to produce a beautiful space that is perfect for any occasion. \n\nIf only the food and service matched the truly stellar decor.  Service was noticeably lacking, as our server had a brusque and curt manner about her. To say she was rough around the edges was an understatement. She appeared to become very frustrated when we asked her questions about the menu that she was unable to answer.  She honestly acted as though she was doing us a favor to find out the answers to very simple questions. \n\nThe next strike was the food. It was quite lackluster and disappointing. The acclaimed Margherita pizza was underwhelming.  We felt like it was on par with the kind of pizza typically found at any \"make your own\" pizza place.  \n\nWhile the sea bass was fairly tasty, the french fries and side of roasted vegetables were served luke warm without much flavor!  I honestly couldn't believe how subpar the food and service were compared to the rave reviews this place often receives.  \n\nPerhaps it was just an \"off night\" and another visit is warranted.  In the meantime, the uninspiring food and off-putting service does not inspire any kind of \"mission\" to head back to Mission Market anytime soon.",

I'm sure you can wear jeans but there were many people dressed up in nice attire. They have a bar you can grab a drink at while you wait for your table. It is pretty dimly lit in there as well so if you want those romantic vibes on a date then this is a good option \n\nFood/price: I feel like you're paying just for the experience and atmosphere more than the actual taste of the food. \nDrinks are typical prices: $12+ \n- empire of the sun: gin based cocktail that was honestly a bit too sweet to me. Beautiful though \nAppetizers: tapas style, small portions, about $20 \n- between 7 people we ordered 2 of the crab cake balls and 2 of the Spanish grilled octopus. The crab cake balls were good (5) and came with a pear/mango type chutney that was interesting. The grilled octopus was really good. Came as one long tentacle that was charred and soooo tender. No rubbery pieces at all. Would get that again if I were to come back \nEntrees: also not huge which is expected, $30+ \n- mission steak aka the steak with chimichurri and fries. The steak was cooked well but I was a bit disappointed in their version of the pesto chimichurri sauce. It was blended finely to the point where it was more like a smoothie texture and the taste was very mild \n- duck breast panang curry: the duck breast was crispy on the outside and cooked well. The panang curry was actually on point and came with mushroom, kale and barley. The barley was hard (undercooked? Not sure). There was not enough of the curry, which was the best part \n\nTLDR: good place for sharing appetizers and drinks with a group of friends or a date. Get the grilled octopus and duck breast",

        "text": "Brunch at Mission + Market was great!  My salad was fresh, and the chicken was cooked well.  I was disappointed by the fact that the gluten free options aren't labeled or even well known.  The waiter told me that he'd have to ask the kitchen staff, but when he came back he didn't sound extremely confident.  Ultimately I picked a salad because I figured it was a safe option, and got home fries hoping they'd be GF.  I'd love to see a GF marked menu or a better informed staff.  Other than that my meal was great and my family thoroughly enjoyed theirs.  (Try the home fries!)",

The service was outstanding. They never skipped a beat, they knew everything I needed at the right time. The hummus with The warm pita bread was delicious! We both got the Seabass, which was good but did not have the flavor I expected, it had a beet sauce to it. After we shared a tiramisu with strawberries which was amazing. Overall four stars. There's valet parking which is complementary but you have to tip. It's a little pricey but it's not too bad. It's a very cute date spot, great for family, great for groups. I'll definitely be back here again to have some drinks and appetizers and dessert. I'm eager to try other stuff on their menu. Definitely go check it out!",

Ha ha\nWe asked and were moved to a much nicer table in the actual restaurant.\n\nOur server was wonderful!!\n\nWe shared an appetizer: spicy tempura shrimp which were tasty but were very much like eating erasers. Tough old bites for tough old biddys.\n\nMy Caesar salad was okay but I've had tastier, much better to be sure. My companion didn't even eat her Little Gem salad as it was stale and the dressing unpleasant.\n\nThree strikes..........\nTwo runs..................\n\nEntrees were challenging.  My duck breast tasted good but the Appalachian Blue Barley was undercooked which I supposed is \"on trend\",  but I would have preferred an accompaniment that was unctuous, soft and silky and cooked.\n\nMy friend had the  chicken breast which she said was very tasty but the \naccompanying veggies and sauce were horrid.  I tasted the sauce and it was very acidic.  \n\nWe told our server that the food wasn't good but she only had a check for nearly $200 to offer.\n\nChef Ian was in house. What's going on?  Does he need some recipes?",

Both of our meals were delicious and came out almost immediately. \n\nThe one caveat is if you're coming from 400, your best option is to either drive around the block to another entrance of the restaurant to try to secure one of the free parking spaces or park in the Three Alliance parking deck. The restaurant does provide validations but mine did not work, and ended up paying an additional $30 for parking so just be mindful and plan accordingly.",

Our waiter not only waited tables but he also did the bar and bussed tables, which is why service is not the best. BUT it's a really pretty restaurant and great location. I just wouldn't come for brunch.\n\nThe food was small portioned and expensive. You could find better brunch elsewhere. Parking is easy: complimentary valet or the deck (which is validated). \n\nThe water wasn't very good, if you were wondering.",

        "text": "Girls night out on a Friday night started off right with dinner here. They don't have a corkage for the first 2 bottles of wine. The fee starts on the third bottle of wine at $25. And the service is excellent. Our waiter was attentive and knew the menu well. We ordered the white mushroom pizza, pesto pasta, mussels, and french fries.  The pesto pasta was bland, but it was cooked perfectly.  The rest of food was great and I really enjoyed the white mushroom pizza. \n\nThe Buckhead area doesn't have many options like this where the price point is reasonable. Sometimes I feel like my only options are places like Chipotle or Bones. It's challenging to find more of a middle, but Mission + Market provides it. \n\nThe restaurant is located in the back. When you enter the area, continue forward until you reach the end. Our Lyft had some trouble finding us.",

It feels more like steamed rather than grilled. I would not recommend It.\n\nHowever, I highly recommend the black sea bass!! The skin of the sea bass is very crispy, while the inside is tender and juicy. The lobster roll is great too. The lobster is very fresh and fits perfectly with the butter bread.\n\nEnvironment: I love the modern architecture. It feels good to dine in the patio at evening. All staff were wearing a mask.\n\nIn all, a great place to hang during covid-19!",

        "text": "How do you ruin Dinner Club? I'll accept part of the blame for allowing the poor service here to get the best of me. I will not accept the poor treatment that we endured, especially since everyone around us seemed to be having an amazing time.\n\nIt all started when we walked in the front door. My roommate Jeff invited me to join his girlfriend Melissa and his co-worker Vanessa for dinner. All four of us took a Lyft from the house and arrived together. Instead of welcoming us to the restaurant the host asked if everyone in our party was there. Keep in mind this is right after he confirmed that we had a reservation for four and obviously four people were standing there.\n\nWe were seated at a table that felt like an afterthought because it seemed like the wait staff wasn't able to navigate our seats without asking someone to move forward (I later confirmed this was correct when a larger table was broken down and the seats pulled from it were staged waiting for us to leave).\n\nWe started with the watermelon salad and octopus to share. Neither were particularly amazing. No joke - the octopus tasted like chicken (gator would be a comparison). During the time it took for them to bring out the appetizers I noticed another table was already ordering their meal... and we were still waiting to order dinner!\n\nAnd we wait.\n\nWait some more.\n\nFinally the server comes back and three of us ordered steak and Jeff's co-worker ordered salmon. This would have been a great opportunity to clear the empty appetizer dishes from our table. Nope. Oh, and the long, haphazardly configured table with the great window view was being served complimentary Champagne because it was someone's birthday. How thoughtful.\n\nAt this point I brought our grievances to the attention of someone running orders that identified himself as the manager. Michael apologized and subtly blamed our server. I sat back down and then our food was served. Our steaks weren't cooked to order and mine was almost well done instead of medium. Jeff and I joked that it tasted like one of our recent Hello Fresh meals. I walked it up to Michael and declined his offer to cook another one.\n\nI guess our server had gotten wind of our complaints because as he was clearing everyone else's plates he asked me if I was getting something else to eat since I was probably still hungry.\n\nThat made Jeff stand up and speak to someone else that identified himself as the manager. They kindly didn't charge me for the steak I didn't eat and took one of the appetizers off of our bill. We didn't take the time to make a reservation, meet up and ride together, and sit down to have a meal together with the intention not to pay. Their response to our bad experience was inappropriate (read: insulting).\n\nPS: Someone needs to water those dead trees inside the restaurant... Maybe consider silk ones like my grandmother has in her living room.",

Their brunch menu is quite limited compared to dinner, but it's still nice. Our server started it out bringing us muffins and something almost looks and tastes like beignet with raspberry filling in it. They both are so good. Crispy on the outside. Fluffy, soft on the inside. Then came our brunch entrees. We ordered couple of entrees to share with our group. We ordered: Beef and Vegetable Hash, Corned Duck Hash Sunny Side Up Duck Egg, Blood Orange Hollandaise, Chicken Chilaquiles, Wild Mushroom Polenta and Chicken and Waffles.

He gave us some great recommendations and checked on us frequently to make sure everything was ok.\n\nI highly recommend the clam, linguine and bread pudding. The clam was  done perfectly. It had the right amount of butter and bacon to make it a perfect appetizer. The linguine was sooo good and I could have two bowls of those. Bread pudding was warm and paired well with the chocolate ice cream.\n\nThey are located besides Little Alley Steakhouse so when you see the sign for it, take that turn and Mission and Market is on the back. They also have free valet. \n\nI highly recommend this place and I will be coming back again!",

        "text": "Mission + Market is surprisingly delicious. I had no expectations for a restaurant in a lobby, even one this nice! My friend and I ate at the bar on a whim, and I'm glad we did. This is a really nice addition to the Buckhead lunchtime dining scene. \n\nDecor is trendy and modern; there is a greenery and glass wall, an elegant marble bar, leather-wrapped brass chairs, the list goes on.... They've pretty much hit every single thing on the \"trendy and modern\" Pinterest board. \n\nAt lunch on a rainy weekday the entire dining room, the bar, and the chef's counter in the back were full. Reservations recommended! \n\nMy friend and I sat at the bar and split a couple of items: \n- Scallop Ceviche ($18) - it seems like a hefty price tag but honestly worth every dollar! The scallops were so tender and silky it can only be described as if they were made of butter themselves. Delicious, and a solid portion.\n\n- Basil Marinated Chicken Sandwich ($11) - served with a tasty grilled chicken breast, pickled vegetable slaw, fresh mint and fresh cilantro. The flavors were great - very banh mi - but I wish the chicken had been pulled or at least sliced. As is, the chicken breast was a lot smaller than the sandwich bread, so at some point you make the decision to just east through the middle of the sandwich and leave crusts leftover on the plate, or to just eat the bread by itself. \n\n- Apricot & Tomato Pizza ($14) - it sounds light but when you add in the charred eggplant, arugula, mint, and Parmigiano-Reggiano on top, this actually makes for a pretty decent entree. We both had a few slices and didn't finish it. \n\nThe bar is well-stocked and they offer a really creative cocktail list. I had mixed feelings about the drink I ordered; I wanted to like it more than I did to be honest. The $12 Spiced Daquiri was described as \"Plantation Stiggins Pineapple Rum, Thai Basil, Black Lava Salt\" and I guess I just assumed from the name it would be a blended drink, but it's literally spiced flavored rum poured over shaved ice and served with basil and salt... so take that for what you will. It wasn't the right cocktail for me but I will definitely try something else next time.",

        "text": "Lots of potential here. Food brought down the rating a tad. \n\nPlace is tucked away off Lenox Rd, down Alliance Dr on the right. Sign is unassuming. Complimentary valet. \n\nDecor is modern and nice. I sat at the bar per my usual solo dining M.O. It was a Saturday night and the place was busy. I don't know about the sound level farther into the restaurant but by the bar in the front it was tolerable. The bar staff was pleasant and the service overall was fine. \n\nThe mushroom polenta was as expected. Nice, creamy polenta, earthy and deep flavor on the mushrooms finished with a flavorful sauce. A definite win. Marrow added a nice touch. \n\nOctopus was charred and had a nice texture. I thought maybe it lacked a little seasoning but was otherwise fine. \n\nScallop ceviche looked wonderful but there was a decidedly fishy taste. I love raw scallop but this was way off. I actually didn't finish it. There was no acid at all which I thought was weird. I think it's more along the lines of a crudo than ceviche.\n\nAnyway, I'll definitely be back to check out some other fare and it's nice to have this in the hood!",

Place was quiet when we came around 12PM and we were seated immediately. \n\nFood: we ordered pretty much some of the highlights of the menu: chilaquilles, beef hash, corned duck hash, ricotta fritters, wild mushroom polenta and chicken waffles. I'd say the beef hash and chicken waffles are the best amongst all. Chicken is crispy yet flavorful and the beef is very subtle and tender.\nService: service is okay but the server seemed like rushing us to get going quickly even though the place was barely busy on a Saturday brunch.\nAmbience: we love Mission Market and this is a cozy place to enjoy get together time",

Well-seasoned, great portion size, and relatively good price as well. The brisket pizza is unfortunately overrated. Not enough brisket and the crust was somewhat dry.
