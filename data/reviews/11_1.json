        "text": "Went to eat during the covid-19 pandemic at the time when businesses were first opening; we decided to eat on the patio. It was an overcast day during the first days of summer and we had an umbrella and a nice breeze, so that was a major plus to the atmosphere.  \n\nWhen we sat down we had to wait on another person in our party, so we were just talking and looking over the menu.  We had multiple workers come by and ask us, probably within the span of minutes separating them, if we needed anything.  It got a little redundant, so we decided to order appetizers.\n\nThe appetizers came out sporadically, and they were nothing to write home about(just to yelp).  The fried pickles were salty, the smoked trout spread had a lot of fillers and the hush puppies were not bad.\n\nOur last companion arrived while the apps staggered in and it took a more than average time to order our main dishes.  They took a long time coming out--I mean, how long does it take to cook a tuna steak rare?  The tuna didn't have much flavor, the fries were not great even with the old Bay seasoning; no one enjoyed the cole slaw that much.  All the food needed something more.\n\nThis was our first experience, and maybe the times had an impact; however, they have a great atmosphere and we wiill be coming back for their happy hour specials and a second or even third chance. So stay tuned for an update.",

I placed a to go order for a fried shrimp platter which came with fries. I get home and there are no fries in my bag. I should've checked my bag prior to departing but I didn't think I needed to because this seemed like a respectable restaurant. I called the restaurant and informed the hostess of the situation and she sincerely apologized a few times. I told her that I wanted management to be aware of the situation and she said she said absolutely. I drive another 20 minutes back to the restaurant and there was a gentlemen at the counter with the hostess. I assumed he was the manager because he was not dressed like any of the staff. Once again, she apologizes for the situation but the manager (if that was the manager) did not say a word to me. He just looked at me like a deer in headlights and let the hostess do his job for him. \n\nI am a very fair person so I will say that the food was decent (despite being very cold) when I was finally able to enjoy the entire meal but at that point, I really didn't event want it anymore. I wish I would've gotten the hostess's name because she was the only good thing about this restaurant. Terrible job all around.",

Negatives - Below average food, average service, poor wine selection, fruit flies.\n\nThe trout dip should be renamed mayo dip.   The oysters were fresh and cold, but lacked flavor.  Mt Olive pickles for the fried pickles?  Terrible poke bowl.  The fresh fish that is displayed when you walk in is unappetizing and should be removed.\n\nIt's all just very average and you can definitely get better value for your money.  Don't waste it.",

Curious to see what pairs well with the menu; 'Juicy Blues' seemed proper for the occasion. \n\nWhen the food hit the table, the plate was clean & prepared well. Not to mention, everything looked beautifully seasoned.\n\nHad a slight hiccup with the Salmon filet. Brought it to the server, & they deliberately bumped it up on the barbie. What a place to be @ when their people care about one another ! \n\nAll & All, I can not wait for my next visit @ Big B's !\n\n\n\nAtmosphere: 9 | 10\n\nService: 9 | 10\n\nFood: 9 | 10",

        "text": "We tried Big B for the first time Friday evening with a take out family meal. Our family of six always orders the same take out or frequents the same restaurants. Recently, we decided to only try new to us places and break the rut. I ordered 2 Family Catches it was ready when we picked it up in about 20 minutes or so. However, walking back to the car it seemed a bit light to feed an advertised 8 people. I looked in the bag and noticed it was only half my order. I returned explained the issue and the were very apologetic and quickly prepared all meals and corrected the order. \n\nIt's fried fish, shrimp and oysters, with sides in a quick take out far from the ocean, so I hoped it would be tasty but did not expect the quality we encountered. It was delicious, the shrimp were plump tender and juicy, the cod moist and lightly crisp, with just enough brine deliciousness to the oysters. My family including our picky eaters where like mom this is great. It's almost never we agree!!\n\nI personally was not a fan of the fries to salty, but I'm sure you could make a request for lightly salted. However, I was a big fan of the slaw, my kids felt it needed a tad more Mayo, but that was the appeal for me. \n\nSolid food and great service, we have a new restaurant.",

The decor is super cute and the restaurant felt clean and new. They were playing music, as well as ocean waves and bird sounds which was a cool touch to make it feel like you were actually at a beach! \n\nWe got a dozen oysters, hush puppies, shrimp and grit fritters, and a tuna poke bowl. We both also got the happy hour $5 margarita and my husband got a mai tai as well. \n\nThe oysters were delicious and a nice size. The fritters were also super yummy as well. I will 100% be back just to order those two items! I felt the hush puppies were a little dry, but they were good. We were disappointed by the poke bowl - it seemed a little lackluster, but I think that is our fault as it came out exactly as described. I think we are used to the poke bowl places where you get a million ingredients in your bowl. Next time I will order a main with a little more pizzazz! \n\nI think our biggest disappointment were the drinks - they were not very strong, but for $5 we felt we couldn't complain. \n\nOur server was fantastic and the busboys were also kind and quick with their service. We did think that they are missing a key thing on their menu - mussels!\n\nOverall, there are not a lot of restaurants like this near us, so we will definitely be back and most likely try the cod sandwich or tacos next time, which will be a little more up our alley!",

Our waiter Corey was good, he offered recommendations and very attentive.  Now the food...lightly breaded, perfectly cooked calamari is a must order!

Located in a plaza near Chastain (among other gems), Big B'a doesn't disappoint. They are doing a great job of social distancing which was much appreciated as I went with my family (including a toddler). Our waited Mamadou was a nice fellow and I'd recommend asking for him to take care of you.\n\nWe ordered the cod bites for my toddler son who wasn't having them so I' decided to have some for myself. They were nice and tender and flaky. Made for a great appetizer for myself. We also got the spicy shrimp appetizer which is similar to a bang bang shrimp. \n\nFor the main coarse I got some blackened grouper which was amazing! Tasted like it was just pulled out of the Gulf. I got it with a side of Caesar salad and Brussels Sprouts. The food was so good that I inhaled it and didn't get a chance to take a picture!\n\nIf you are ever in the Buckhead/Chastain/Sandy Springs area I highly recommend checking Big B's...you won't be disappointed!",

I received a call, probably 15-20 later that my order was ready! Yay! \nShrimp and grits fritters- 2/5\nCatfish platter (3/5), greens (1/5), fries (5/5)\nThe platter comes with one catfish filet and had a pretty heavy coating on it. I didn't think it was particularly flavorful, but thanks to the pandemic, I was able to season at home. The fritters seemed like a great idea...but in actuality, I was left searching for the shrimp. The homemade sauce that comes with the fritters was amazing though! \nThe greens....these were mushy (i.e. overcooked) and lacked flavor. Thankfully the fries were a hit! Handcut, well seasoned!\n\nI may return for the Happy Hour now that I'm fully vaccinated!",

While Big B's lacks the white tablecloth atmosphere of more formal seafood havens, the seafood is no less fresh.  I love seared sea scallops and Big B's does them right.  Your dinner comes with a side and a very nice side salad which makes their modest prices a good bargain.  Service is always friendly and the GM is a constant presence.

It is incorrect and will create a barrier for delivery time with the driver having to communicate with you with the restaurant in person on speakerphone. The restaurant employee I spoke with has obviously forgotten that not very long  ago his job was jeopardized by covid. There is no room for arrogant attitudes and impatience with getting a customer's order correct due to the Restaurant's obvious error, particularly now nor in the future.\nJust correct your menu on Grubhub!",

Still had lots of bun with no fish.  I'd be surprised if it was Cod because it was the chewyist fish I've ever had.   I asked for onion for the sandwich and they put pickled onion on it!  No tartar sauce on the side, little thin spread on the cold bun, not toasted.\nThis sandwich was $14.95.  On the plus side fries were great.  Service was good too.  My friend had shrimp tacos.  Good but, not the best she's ever had.",

The ambiance was reminiscent of a hipster version of dive pier restaurant, it was cute, but has been done before, a lot. The lobster roll was sooo dry and the roux for the gumbo literally tasted like 1 of those gravy packets you get from the store, but maybe a little thicker and not as flavorful. In their defense, I am a bit of a gumbo snob, with Papadeux's being the closest thing to real gumbo I have had here in GA. There is another spot in Midtown that has some pretty good gumbo, I'll update with name for anyone interested. Ummm, the pinot was good, and it was happy hour, so that made it taste better. I'm sad because I had high hopes, and to be honest the 3rd star was for the great personable people there, otherwise, 2 stars would have been it. Sorry guys!",

I stopped by for happy hour which is daily from 4p-7p! They have $1 oysters, $5 margaritas and wine, and $3 bar bites! We enjoyed the Oysters,Old Bay fries and hush puppies. Service was attentive, and the space is airy and clean including the restrooms. The restaurant also has a nice patio for outdoor dining. They sell food to go at the walk up counter(sandwiches and platters) which many seemed to stop by and take advantage of for later. They also sell fresh seafood to cook at home.",
