My boyfriend took down the single coronary bypass burger and was very full after, but really enjoyed it. The tots and fries were delish! I had the mini bbq pork sliders and loved that they were topped with mac. The side of mac was also so good! My boyfriend's mom loved the 50/50 chili too. It was such a cool vibe here and our waiter was super friendly, and he told my boyfriend he was impressed with him taking down the burger. I wish I could come here all the time!",

        "text": "I'm still new-ish to the Atlanta area. Vortex has been on my list for the past two years and I finally went for the first time this past summer. Vortex is a solid burger place for several reasons. \n\nLet's talk about their burgers - I can always tell a good burger place by the way they cook their burgers \"well.\" That being said, I've gotten two well-done burgers and both were fully cooked through, soft, moist, and stayed together the entire time.  I've eaten at Vortex Midtown and Little Five Points and both get an A+ for burger consistency. \n\nNext, the variety of burgers they have. I like this restaurant for the sole reason they take all your favorite American foods, and toss them on a burger in the most special way. Their mixture of fresh and cooked ingredients topped with special sauces for each of their burgers make this place truly special. And hey, if you're not feeling beefy they also have chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, grilled cheese, chili, soup and salad (all pretty epic, especially their chili with that special cornbread). \n\nFinally, The Vortex is the type of place you take your friends from out of town for an experience they'll be sure to remember. If it's not the giant skull, tits, or quirky sayings that get their attention, the food will come out and they'll be sure to have a memorable experience. Hands down, 5 stars.",

My husband and I decided to try the Moreland location because it's closer to our home. \nFirst...We had to park down the street in a lot for $10.\nSecond... we paid for drinks and decided to wait on the balcony for our table which is extremely tight. An employee walked by and said \"don't block the stairs\". Very rude and uncalled for. My husband complained to management and we left. As we were leaving my husband told the hostess to cancel our table. She then started screaming \"what did you say? I didn't hear you\" like a maniac. The manager was nice and professional as well as a gentleman host at the front door.\n\nSome of the employees had dirty hands and fingernails. The place smelled bad inside and out and just looked unsanitary. I've never had issues at the Peachtree location so don't waste your time.",

The Disco taters are supposed to be a take on the famous Canadian poutine. They were good but not quite poutine. They claim make the best burgers in ATL, they're good but not the best. I had the fat Elvis which peaked my interest, the combination of peanut butter and plantain works; but I believe they put a little too much peanut butter on the bun so if you get that ask for less peanut butter. The chopped cheese was very good and well cooked and prepared. The staff was down to earth and attentive. You will definitely leave this restaurant satisfied and full!",

Instead we decided to walk around & check out the shops that were open. Well we should have put pur names on the list because the place was packed & poppin. After putting our names on the list & waiting about 30 mins or so, we were seated. Rachel, our wonderful server attended to us very well throughout the night even though we got there kind of late & they closed at 12a. I ordered the Southern Mess chicken sandwich topped w/ fried egg, bacon, & white gravy. Tater tots on the side. Excellent choice & great portion size for anyone. My friend ordered buffalo wings which, again were awesome! Spicy, but not too much & seasoned well. Highly recommend either of these. Next time, I will try one of their drinks from the bar.",

So when my partner went to ask the host if there would be a server coming soon (after we watched another couple get seated and given water and silverware), he had a blank look on his face and said \"I'm not sure.\" So we asked for a manager and the host said \"Why because they'll need a reason.\" He finally goes to get the manager and her attitude and demeanor was horrible. Absolutely horrible and she told us he asked that in \"case I'm in the back busy.\"  Ahd she told us \"don't talk to him (the host) talk to me!\" She was very very rude!! All we wanted was to eat a good burger and get treated like the paying customers we were. We didn't approach with an attitude or rudely.  But we were treated so rudely and disrespectfully by the host and the manager and it was extremely disappointing.",

Server was weird energy as hell. Actually threw the silverware and napkins on the table as she walked past without saying a word or getting drinks in. When I ordered the salad I said surprise me with the dressing bc I didn't care. She rudely said \"that doesn't help, we have a lot of dressings.\" Um ok... Service was slow af - waited FOREVER to get the check and then get it back. I could go on... Like I said, the food was very good, and the orders were correct. But there's a lot more to dining in somewhere besides the food itself. I couldn't fucking wait to get out of there.

I called The Vortex to let them know it's highly possible one of their employees is swiping card numbers from their customers. Manager really seemed uninterested and literally said, \"I'll look into it but I don't know when it'll be\". Didn't ask any questions as in, what was your servers name? What time were you here? What makes you think it was here? Nothing... \n\nI will return to the Vortex, but next time I'll be paying in cash. Just be aware.

Pictures on the walls might not be suitable for young children - this IS a bar.\n\nThe food is excellent!  I had Zombie & friend had Bleu Burger.  Both Perfectly cooked. Very well balanced.  The Zombie had heat, but not so much to detract from the flavor of the overall dish.  Generous portion of bleu cheese on the Bleu Burger.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND.\nI will be returning.\n\nIf you have a large party, you may want to insist the wait person write your order down. We only had 2 people & 1 very minor item was missed.",

Cold face all the way and eventually threw the check on the table, grabbed the check from the table and turned around in half sec without any word. Yes, threw. So rude! \n\nBut my husband was over nice and still gave her 20% tips. I would say 10% or none. We are supposed to pay the tips for excellent service, she doesn't deserve it at all!\n\nMy husband and I both felt very uncomfortable with her service because of the rudeness, but I heard she treated the white couple at the table right behind me very politely. 'Sure', 'Of course' sounds with smile. \n\nI don't want to label her as a racist even if I saw some customers mentioned 'racist' below, but definitely won't recommend this place to my brown and black friends.\n\nTo Manager/supervisor if you know who iam talking about, please let her know: If she doesn't like this job, please don't do it. If you don't like some customers, please let other serve. \n\nRuined the food and mood completely.",

        "text": "This place is quirky and the brashness of the house rules on the menu can be off putting but the food is good (as soon as I walked in about 2 self proclaimed regulars recommended the potato salad to me) and the bartenders were absolutely lovely. Service was quick which we appreciated. \n\nMy burger (the one with pineapple) was perfection and  my Georgia peach mule was refreshing (brought my sister here and she was obsessed with this mule)...and they don't skimp on the alcohol. \n\nIt's pretty popular and can get crowded resulting in a wait (and you can't make reservations) but the bar usually has space. I don't prefer coming here with a group since I usually feel like it's a tight squeeze...like if I turn wrong I might hit someone at another table accidentally. \n\nCute area so this is a good place to catch a bite before exploring the area",

        "text": "Meh, It's not the best but it's not the worst. Let me explain..\n\nAtmosphere - I will give 5 stars for that. I love all the decorations on the wall, and its very relaxing inside. There's booth and table options as well as a bar. They have all different kinds of beer on top and wines available too. \n\nService - We only had what we thought was 45 minutes before my flight and had plenty of time to order several drinks, 2 burgers and appetizers. The server was very nice and friendly, so I will give 5 stars there too. \n\nParking- Enough parking in the back when it's not too busy, but I could see it being an issue if it's very very crowded. We went on a Monday afternoon and it was still decently busy just an FYI. \n\nFood- Now here is where I have the main issue. I got the burger with provolone cheese, mushrooms and steak sauce. To be honest I thought it was huge and awkward to eat. Plus the beef tasted very charred and I did not taste any seasoning in the meat, couldn't taste salt or anything. Yeah the steak sauce made up for that , but not enough to cover the slightly burnt flavor. So meh. I got a side of fried zucchini and my friend got the tator tots. Looking back I should've gotten the tator tots. I like my fried zucchini breaded, not battered. But if you like battered fried zucchini, then that's the choice for you. \n\nOver all, I'd go back here but honestly just for drinks and appetizers. I've had way better burgers in Texas so maybe I'm spoiled. \n\nP.S. they do allow smoking. When it wasn't too crowded I couldn't smell it. But I can imagine it could be bad when lots of people are there.",
