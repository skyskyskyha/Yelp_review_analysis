Beyond delicious with the best broth I've ever had for a Chinese restaurant.  Get it!  Not a fishy taste or smell at all..

House special noodles, a pork cutlet and salt n pepper shrimp were delicious. \n\nI'd be willing to try this spot again but not so n a Saturday night.",

The centerpiece of our meal, the three-course Peking duck, carved tableside, was a feast for both the eyes and palate. Each course unveiled a new layer of flavor, truly highlighting the chef's mastery in preparing this classic dish.\n\nThe ribs and dumplings were also standout dishes, offering a harmonious blend of rich, traditional flavors. Complementing these were the hand-crafted cocktails, which were both innovative and delightful, enhancing our overall dining experience.\n\nThe service at Hsu's was exceptional. The staff were not only attentive but also displayed deep knowledge of the menu, guiding us through our choices with expert recommendations. Their warmth and professionalism significantly elevated our dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance of Hsu's added to the allure of the evening. It struck a perfect balance between warmth and elegance, creating a welcoming yet sophisticated atmosphere. The tasteful decor, blending traditional and modern elements, provided the ideal backdrop for our memorable meal.\n\nIn summary, Hsu's delivered an outstanding dining experience. The combination of exquisite food, stellar service, and a cozy yet chic setting made our visit truly remarkable. I wholeheartedly recommend Hsu's to anyone in search of culinary excellence. A well-deserved five stars!",

It closed at 9 and I was worried that we had to get there way before 9 in order to be seated (considering these other spots in the ATL) but that was not the case. They were seating and greeting people even when we left at around 8:30. \n\nWe were greeted by who I'm assuming was the owner and our server was amazing. Didn't get his name but he was super attentive, made great recommendations. The place is not super fancy, but it reminded me of the old school Bay Area Chinese spots. Simple, authentic with good food.\n\nI ordered egg drop soup, which wasn't on the dinner menu and omg it was sooooo good, thick broth with thick real egg drops. It was lovely and needed on this freezing night. \n\nWe also got the Mongolian beef. It was sweet and great with a ton of onions. I love onions. They could have been grilled a bit more, but they were decent enough. The chow mein.. or was it lo mein? Was really good. It was only the 2 of us and we finished everything. Can't wait to come back!\n\nGreat service and great food. Especially if u love Chinese food like me.",

They were delicious and the spicy mustard was one of the hottest yet best I've ever tasted. I love seafood, but I usually stay away from it in Atlanta. I am from the coast and am usually quite picky when it comes to my seafood. I made an exception after seeing a few people enjoying bowls of soup and decided it must be the Spicy Anna's. Spicy Anna's seafood noodle soup was one of the best things I have ever eaten. The broth was rich with flavor, despite not being very thick. The shrimp, scallops and chicken were delightful, and perfectly cooked. The aroma was ridiculous, and the spices were intense without overriding the flavors. The noodles were like a delicious lo mein noodle... savory, and soft. I cannot wait to go back and have it again.",

There is a bike lane in front of the location and usually there are a couple of cars parked there to pick up orders. \n\nIf you choose to dine in there is a parking deck next to the restaurant and they will validate parking for that deck. They are open for lunch from 11:30am to 2. They reopen at 5pm for dinner and close at 9.\n\nI've only had the seafood hot and sour soup. It has shrimp and scallops. The cost is just about $9. \n\nConsistently the soup has only two shrimp and about six scallops. It's soup so it's hard to tell when the seafood is added, but since I've never had more than two shrimp in the soup. While I don't expect it to be all seafood, the amount of shrimp is a little disappointing. \n\nThe hot and sour soup is available without seafood for just about $4. \n\nVery nice staff and great service. They'd probably earn 5 stars if I'd eaten inside and tried anything but the soup. \n\nI'll definitely return.",

The food here is always good and I have literally come her since I was seven with my mother. she would often take me to work and after I helped her , I would be rewarded with the delicious foods Hsus has to offer.Her favorite dish was the schezwan style string beans and I loved it as a kid as well due to its crunchy texture from the string beans mixed with juicy ground beef and the schezwan spices that gives the dish a great balance with a kick .My favorite dishes include the jjambbong( Spicy Anna's Seafood Noodle Soup) ,jjajamyun( black bean curd noodles) , mapo tofu , walnut shrimp ,spicy basil chicken and the hot and sour soup. It may sound like the whole menu but yes the food is that good and if my twenty two years of experience doesn't convince you then ask all the famous people that has stopped by like Keanu Reeves , Jeremy Lin and a bunch of other people that have a picture up on their wall. The taste of the food is always consistently good but that's because the same family has been running the restaurant for years. Customer service is always fantastic and the best part is that they don't dump a bunch of msg or sauce on top of their food like most Chinese restaurants in downtown.\nIf your visiting or you work downtown and you want some delicious Chinese food , Hsus is a restaurant I would highly recommend!",

The soup was good  not great- seemed to have more of a Szechuan flair; chicken broth based with both pork and shrimp. Not the best that had in the Atlanta Metro, but still good. \nThe sesame chicken was fantastic, reasonable smaller sized/light portion for lunch - crispy golden brown & a rich and flavorful sauce. \nTheir pricing is quite high. Most places in the area include an entree, egg roll, chicken wing & soup for the same cost as Hsu's entree alone. \nI would rate 3.5 stars if Yelp allowed it, I gave the 4th star because of the nice ambiance & efficient staff.",

Definitely would never order again but maybe come back for a different dish. Fried rice was also good. One small bowl of soup and dumpling appetizer with general tso's chicken and scallops were over $100 so if you're on a budget not the place for you but was pretty good and will probably try again in the future.",

I feel we were kind of whispering a little to keep our conversation private lol. Not a bad thing. Very family friendly. The establishment is very clean, the customer service was great as well. I feel the owner, and staff were good at making sure the food was prepared well, and tasty for us. \n\nI have to say the food tastes very fresh. The price point is a tiny bit up there for Chinese. However, it's worth it. I ordered the honey walnut shrimp, and crab wontons (which are listed on the menu as something else).. can't remember the name. My 11 y/o daughter ordered won ton soup, and the house lomein minus the beef. Everything was really good, however I wasn't too impressed with the wontons.\n\nI believe there's an automatic gratuity tax on the bill. The menu is short, and sweet making it very easy to order your food. I highly recommend this place, and will definitely be coming back.",

When we left the restaurant I noticed all the celebrity photos on the wall. So many famous people have eaten here,  athletes,  movie stars,  politicians. Keanu reeves and Paul walker have both eaten here! Anyway,  cool spot.",

BTW, if you don't love the food they bring out alert the wait staff immediately and they will make it right for you.  That's been my experience.",

We ordered and the food came out in about 10-15 minutes. The prices are a little high but it was about the same I've seen across Atlanta, the portions were big and it was good to be able to take a box home for lunch. The flavor was great and pineapple fried rice has become one of my new favorite dishes. The pork was a little dry, but I would totally come back",

Service was a little slow at first. \n\nWe shared the Mongolian Beef -- very tasty!\n\nDefinitely an authentic Chinese dining experience.",
