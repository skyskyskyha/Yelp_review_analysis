        "text": "I should just head to Aviva by Kameel whenever I feel down. Not just because the food is stellar, which it totally is, but because Kameel himself is so chipper and enthused to see you, a total stranger, greeting you like an old pal. \"Hello, my sister!\"s, huge grins, and handing out free petite cups of a comforting, slightly spicy tomato-based soup would lift anyone's soul.\n\nKameel actually passed out falafel to us in the line before handing out the soup. I don't consider myself a falafel person but really found the steamy warm ball appetizing, with its crunchy exterior and soft interior and eyeball-like dots of sauce. Later he plopped a small square of baklava onto my tray alongside my lunch. This was the right combo of crunch, cinnamon, and sweetness. And finally, a woman came by with small plates of juicy watermelon cubes. So instead of one meal, I probably had 1.5.\n\nIt's not just Kameel who's super nice, all the other staffers were too. There was short wait even though it was the tail end of lunchtime. It was about 15 minutes from entering the queue to paying; at least the line moved regularly. I ended up getting the rosemary chicken platter which was $11.45 and came with two pita triangles and your choice of two sides. Plus a bonus falafel too. I got the eggplant ratatouille and mmjadara which was a lentil-brown rice blend with caramelized onions. It was all tasty. Packed with flavor. The chicken wasn't skimpy; I got a breast and thigh. The breast was slightly dry, but the thigh was perfectly moist. The skin and the sauce were the real highlights. The skin had a great blend of spices, salt, and citrus. I couldn't hear what the young man was saying about the chicken's sauce, but I didn't turn it down and that was the correct decision.\n\nI couldn't eat the whole platter. If you want to elicit food envy from your coworkers, simply bring leftover rosemary chicken to the office and heat it up. Three people trilled \"That smells so good!\" at me. Too bad I couldn't pass off Kameel's creations as my own.\n\nAviva by Kameel is closed evenings and weekends. There are bathrooms right outside the restaurant and some inside as well. Tip with cash if paying by card.\n\nIt's a no-brainer why Aviva by Kameel is rated so highly on Yelp. The people who work around Peachtree Center and visitors in the area are lucky to have Aviva around!",

        "text": "Ordered: falafel platter with 3 sides ($11)\n\nAmbience: inside the Peachtree center. very busy lunch place\n\nReview: a little pricey but good quality food. I must have written a review on this spot in the past. So Aviva is a family run business. Kameel is the original chef and you'll see him walking around attending to customers. His customer service and unique business style really put this spot on the map of ATL. He remembers his customers name, brings out samples for folks to try. Everyday the line wraps around the shop during lunch hours. Its fresh and flavorful food. \n\nFalafel are deeply fried but you don't feel the excess oil. It reheats well the elme the day which tells you it's fresh. The falafel sizes are decent. Lentil soup - there are many variations of it depending on the day. I am a huge fan of lentil. Now if you've never had lentil soup before, you gotta try it at Aviva (and Sababa at Dunwoody). It's got right amount of spices infused in the soup and it's not spicy. Cream and spinach is actually very creamy. Has a good salt balance and it tastes smooth. As samples we got his blueberry muffins (delicious) and fresh watermelon. That took care of desert. Make a trip to Aviva. It's worth it!",

Although the hours on yelp say that they're opened in the morning, this is only for their juice cafe. They don't start serving lunch until 11:00am. \n\nFor a place in a food court, Aviva is awesome. They have a variety of fresh and hot Mediterranean food items. The pricing and portions could be a little better when you're getting the food to-go, but given the restaurant quality taste of the food, I'm willing to pay a little extra than if I were to go to some place like a Daphne's. During my visit here, I got to try the salmon and lamb shawarma. Surprisingly, the salmon was the better protein for me. It was moist and perfectly seasoned. I had high expectations for the lamb shawarma but it was too heavily spiced and salty for me to really enjoy. The side dishes I got were all good, but a stand out was their hummus. Next time I stay in the Marriott marquis Or the Hyatt regency, I'll definitely cross the skybridge to grab lunch here.",

        "text": "Ya'll. The stories are true. This place cannot be missed. These folks have continued to receive \"Best of...\" awards for good reason. The food here is stellar and it's paired with quick, friendly service. \n\nI ordered the chicken shawarma platter and my sides included grilled veggies and half hummus/half baba ganoush with some pita bread. The platter also came with a well seasoned and perfectly crisp falafel. I, as a self proclaimed condiment queen, added tahini sauce and hot sauce to my shawarma and falafel for a little extra kick. Highly recommend adding those to your meal, at least on the side! \n\nLet's start with the chicken shawarma itself, shall we? Absolutely freakin' delicious. Tender chicken breast cut into strips, seasoned wonderfully with their Turkish spices. Mixed with a little house hot sauce and some tahini, you've got a wonderful mix! The grilled veggies included squash, zucchini, carrots and broccoli which were all fresh and seasoned with olive oil and salt and pepper. Now to the creamy corner of my platter - the hummus and baba ganoush. Holy moly, these were rich and savory. The hummus, which is chickpea based with garlic and tahini, was thick and simple with olive oil drizzled on top. The baba ganoush was probably my favorite cold side as it's eggplant based and absolutely divine. The two pieces of pita were fresh and perfect for dunking into these creamy dips!\n\nThis is food you can feel good about because they cook with locally sourced ingredients and serve only hormone and additive free meats. I didn't see Kameel on this particular visit, but I look forward to meeting him at future visits because this place leaves you wanting to come back for more!\n\nAviva has plenty of their own seating but The Hub (how they are now referring to the Peachtree Center food court) has updated dining area including bar seating and updated booths and tables. They are still under construction as of this post (3/11/19) but hopefully the end result will just mean more success for this awesome eatery!\n\nOverall, a wonderful experience and looking forward to many future visits!",

Look for it in the food court, near the entrance up the stairs from the street, or through tone of the overhead tunnels from the surrounding hotels. The owner will come out into the dining room to greet you and welcome you. We will definitely be back. \n\nFood: 5/5  It's cafeteria style and the food is replenished frequently. We liked the rosemary chicken, lamb  schwarma,and chicken schwarma,  and all the vegetable sides -the  mixed fresh vegetables are lightly steamed(not cooked to mush); the spinach and the  lentils are nicely seasoned dishes;; the pita is fresh, and the salads are fresh.  On the day we were there the owner brought small slices of watermelon out to the people waiting in line -a very. Ice gesture. Food is packaged in cardboard so you can do carry-out if you don't want to eat on-site. \n\nStaff 5/5-friendly, pleasant, helpful. Even the welcomes you.\n\nFacility-5/5 clean, modern and there are a few tables inside the serving area. If they are full or if you prefer-there are tables out in the main lobby of the food court.  \n\nLocation 4/5 The food court is large, with several types of restaurants and food-and This restaurant is near an entrance .and is larger than some of the fast good places, but Look for the sign! It is inside a glass enclosure. The food court itself is an easy walk from the surrounding hotels BUT IT IS NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOR DRIVERS because of the parking. .  Street parking is $12 per hour. The parking rates near it are up to $20 for one hour at the local hotels\" parking garages-  like the Marriott Marquis -so Park in one of the overground parking garages across the street for $2 each 20 minutes ($6 per hour)  The food is worth the $6 parking fee for the hour you will be there.",

We were waiting outside when the owner took out some free samples of sweet potato pies and tomato-based soup for us to try. He was so passionate and cares so much about the customers. This makes the customers happy and also his employees love to work there.\n\nFood is amazing! They offer a good selection. Actually we came back for a second time. Ordered lamb for the first time and chicken for the second. Personally I prefer the chicken. It is more favorable and not that dry.",

        "text": "Well darn. I was so excited for this place. The service was super lukewarm bordering on brisk. My grilled veggies were nearly raw, the eggplant was mostly peel, and I found the quinoa bitter. The bread was a spongy, tough, cornbread type deal that had a metallic almost baking soda-like flavor. The sweet potatoes were delicious but so sweet it was like a dessert. The aromatic olives added on the side tasted exactly the way banana boat sunblock tastes. Perhaps a strong coconut flavor is to be expected? For a place lauded as being a top lunch spot, I left deeply disappointed and still hungry. It's hard judging restaurants by their vegetable options but my gripes seemed grounded in poor preparation and lack of attention to detail. How those veggies could have visually looked done is beyond me. My experience seems atypical but wanted to share it regardless.",

I loved that I could order earlier in the day and schedule a pick up time that was convenient to me. \n\nWhen I arrived, I quickly noticed how clean the establishment was. I was also welcomed warming by two employees. My food was hot, ready to go upon arrival and packaged with care. All utensils and napkins were included which seems like a silly detail to note, but during COVID, a surprising number of restaurants are not doing that for to go. \n\nAnd now to the food. WOW it was delicious. My friends and my husband both got the chicken shawarma and gave it rave reviews. I had the falafel and it was great! As sides, we tried the hummus sweet potatoes and grilled veggies. Next time, I want to try the baba ghanoush and mmjadara. \n\nA great find in Midtown and Downtown Atlanta.",

        "text": "My experience at Aviva by Kameel was one of the better culinary experiences I've enjoyed in recent memory.\n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nBefore I even set foot in the line at Aviva I got a taste of what an amazing experience I was about to have. Kameel Srouji himself was walking to and fro, handing out free samples and laughing and joking with the crowd to ensure everyone in what was about a fifteen minute lunch line had smiles on their faces: it worked. \"I love you!\" he would say as he handed out soup before going back to ensure the culinary assembly line was going okay and giving some feedback here and there. It's rare that I know that I'm going to write a five star review before even laying eyes on the food but I knew that's what was going to happen here. Kameel's warmth is simply the definition of what dining out should feel like. From there things only got better with a fresh wrap that was made right in front of me. Star. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nAt $14.95 my wrap wasn't cheap, but that was certainly the case once you realize that this could have easily been two full meals. Star. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nHow could I have not loved this wrap? It was made literally right in front of me with a swath of fresh ingredients that couldn't have been better as they were brought together. I opted for mixed meat lamb and chicken, and they came together brilliantly with the fresh greens, veggies, and a sauce of my choosing. Excellent. Two Stars. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nThere's a reason that Aviva by Kameel is the highest rated restaurant in Atlanta. Star.",

I saw that Aviva is one of the best places to eat in ATL so during a break between classes i decided to stop by. I'm so glad I made the walk over here. Aviva is by far one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had!\n\nAviva is a small Mediterranean restaurant located in a food court within Peachtree Center. When I walked in I was expecting a order and pick up style menu but was surprised that all the options of food and combinations were laid in a buffet style. Since this place is so popular, the line till you get to order your plate was really long but Kameel Srouji and other employees would walk down the line handing out fresh samples to everyone. His generosity and happy attitude made this the most enjoyable time I've ever spent waiting for food. \n\nAs I finally ordered, Mr. Srouji was back behind the glass welcoming everyone to his restaurant letting each person know how much he appreciates that they stopped by. For this trip I went ahead and ordered the Chicken shawarma, Eggplant ratatouille, some baked potatoes, with a falafel and pita bread. \n\nThe Chicken shawarma was a burst of flavor, and was only complimented with the sauce of the eggplant ratatouille. Both are best enjoyed as a hot and fast as possible. I could not guess the seasoning used for the baked potatoes but they were phenomenal none the less. \n\nIf you are a student in the ATL area, one of the employees working around Peachtree Center, or just visiting, Aviva will be a restaurant experience you will never forget!",

The spices/seasoning is amazing and they complement each other perfectly. My friend ordered an entree of falafel and a side of it too, and they forgot his entree portion, but I know this process is new.

Expect a long line, made palatable by the fact that Kameel will bring around samples to whet your appetite (he may also proclaim his love for you in the process). The line moves quickly, so it can be a little disorienting when you finally get to counter, if you haven't yet decided what you're ordering. Food-wise, I'd say my chicken shwarma plate was solid 4* (and easily made for two meals). Everything was good, but nothing was exceptional. The ingredients seemed of good quality, and nothing was overly oily or salty (one or the other typically ruins Mediterranean food for me). I'll definitely return, but will likely try something different when I do.",

I was attending a work conference nearby and my colleagues & I needed a quick lunch that was as healthy as we could manage, so luckily we stumbled upon Aviva. We were given soup samples by who I presume to be Kameel, who greeted us with such warmth and kindness. I got the chicken shawarma plate with sweet potatoes and tabouli--all so flavorful and excellent! I was also given some bread and a piece of falafel, which both were unbelievably tasty! I added both the tahini and rosemary sauce to my chicken and it was ridiculously delicious. All of us raved about our meals & we tried to come back on Saturday when it was unfortunately closed. Next time I'm in Atlanta I will go out of my way to get another meal here. Just wonderful.",

The chicken was tasty but a little dry, helped by the tahini sauce and hot sauce. The baba ganoush was as good as any I've had, and the spinach had an unexpected and fun little spicy kick to it.\n\nOwner Kameel roamed about and schmoozed, telling everyone \"I love you\". This would be awkward and strange from anyone else, but it works for him.\n\nI really wanted to be able to give Aviva three or four stars, just on principle, but in all fairness I can't.

Line moves pretty quickly and they handed out small cups of tomato, parmesan, basil soup to enjoy during the wait. Almost did not have time to finish my soup by the time we could order. Owner was walking around complimenting people and joking that you can only have 3 cups if you are driving \n\nRight before we reached the counter someone else offered us a sample of some blueberry treat. \n\nI ordered the Lamb Shawarma platter and the lamb was amazing!!!!! Shaved right there off the vertical rotisserie with tasty seasoned edges. Portions were plenty, sauces were flavorful. Once at the table, another person came around with plates of chopped up watermelon and fruit for us if we wanted it. \n\nThis place is a friendly, well-oiled machine of mediterranean deliciousness. It is clear that it matters to them that we came in and they appreciated our business. The seating is also not crowded and the atmosphere is quiet so you can hear other talk over lunch. LOVED IT.
