The El Pastor and the Steak tacos are perfection. The flavors are explosive and balanced at the same time. It is so savory and the house made hot sauce is some of the best I have ever had as well. They sell it by the bottle and you are a fool if you don't take one home with you. You have to eat here. Even if you don't live close by you have to drive here to try it. Order the pork and steak and it will change your life. I promise. The service is wonderful as well. They are so kind and quick to do anything they can to make your experience the best.",

I read this to my staff and we were laughing so hard we were in tears.  Thank you for the comic relief.\nI cant resist, according to your comments/logic,  if one should venture out to a chinese restaurant and the only people eating there are non chinese one should leave? If going to an Italian restaurant and the place is not filled with Italians one should leave.... Just out of curiosity who/whom should we look for when we go to Waffle House or McDonalds???   Dying to know.  Perhaps you could post a guide for all of to keep handy and refer to.  “How to racially profile a restaurant”..... a morons guide to eating out\n\nOn the contrary we find your ethnicity comments disgusting.",

The only problem is the front parking lot can only fit about 3 cars, put there is plenty of parking in the back. So when I walked in I was able to order immediately. The lady at the counter suggested the fish taco and the pork belly taco. So thats what I ordered along with the guacamole.  The guacamole was delicious. The Big Fish taco was very meaty and very filling. However it had no flavor at all\n I did speak with the staff about it. He apologized for that. The pork belly taco was also very good. I will try this spot again because its not far from home.",

Wouldn't return. First, the price is a bit steep, especially considering it's store bought tortillas and cheap quality meat. \n\nOur tacos came, pork belly was good, fish taco was fine. Steak taco I thought was an accidental ground beef, but no, it was steak, but it was quite gristly, and not seasoned well. Same goes for the chicken taco. As for the queso (if you can call it that), it tasted like a version of kraft Mac n cheese. Chips were fine. Nothing to write home about. \n\nInitially I was going to rate this a 2/5, then I started reading how \"business owner Jason\" responds to negative reviews. We'll never go again. Honestly it's sad how a business owner is openly berating customers public ally is just inexcusable. I understand, customers can be wrong, but if the way you treat customers is so rude, I feel terrible for your workers. I've worked at plenty of restaurants and seen plenty of bad reviews, and any time, the owner would be kind, invite the customer to a free meal on the house to discuss how they might see it better.\n\nNow I guess I'll wait patiently to get berated by Jason.",

Our experience: Poor service and bland tacos and salsa.\nCame in and the cashier seemed more interested in what was on TV than taking our order. There was an assistant or food expediter (brought food from the kitchen to the table) and her attitude was terrible. We asked about what was on a taco we ordered and she said it was whatever is on the menu and if we wanted something different we should have asked. Unnecessary poor attitude and customer service.\nThe tacos were close to flavorless even with chimichurri, and tasted bland.\nWe also had salsa which would be classified as pico de gallo. Mostly heavy lime and salt and not remarkable.\nThe decor of the restaurant was pretty cool.\nThe service was poor.\nThis was both a waste of our time and money.",

        "text": "*food*\nI got the classic taco. DELICIOUS. Ground beef is both juicy and flavorful. \n\n*allergy* \nNow, if you have a shellfish allergy (as I do) - I spoke to them about this. From what I understood/how it was explained to me, the grill is primarily used for steak and shrimp, the shrimp being on one side only. The spatula, may or may not be used to handle both. Everything else, ground beef,  etc. seems to be prepared elsewhere. Be sure to let the staff know of your allergy when you order. They were very, very accommodating about this, and they will be able to better give you an idea for your safety. That being sad, I would feel more comfortable if they had a standard allergy protocol, where they have separate utensils and grills, but that is asking for a lot of accommodation, esp for a small restaurant so I do understand that. Just something to mention. Overall they will be very accommodating to you, and it made me feel very taken care of.\n\n*margaritas*\nOKAY LETS TALK ABOUT THIS - all the hardship you have faced in 2020 - is about to be cleansed. They filled the cups up so much they overflowed. And you got STRONG tequila with every sip. They know what you've been through and they've got you. \n\n*corona safety* \nThey do pick up / walk up behind the building, so drive around back.they have masks and all that is required to feel safely served",

        "text": "Based on the pics and reviews, I thought this place would be a winner. Especially since it's in my neighborhood too but it's a hard pass for me. I mean the service is great. They greet you as you walk in and the staff discards your tray and dishes for you so you don't have to worry about it. Unfortunately, Parking can be a pain if the main lot behind the building is filled up. On the other hand, there's street parking and parking on the lawn but I ended up parking across the street at Fabricate Studios and my car was fine. Now the food...Sigh. Nothing special about it at all. I ordered the Mexican bowl which you basically choose any of the tacos on the menu and it'll come in a bowl version. I ordered the vegetarian one and added black beans. I thought I'd be getting it in a taco shell or something since I was only ordering the bowl version but no. There wasn't anything Mexican about it. It was a small size bowl of the beans, guacamole and tomatoes. And apparently if you want rice, you'll have to ask for it which I didn't understand because the taco itself comes with rice. \n\nAnd the cilantro/jalapeño margarita? Way salty. No bueno. Its a nice size place and they have live music - giving off a coffee shop vibe. And it stays busy. I mean the lines were pretty long at several points of the evening. Maybe their other tacos are better.",

The margaritas quality isn't as good. The meat was really grizzly. The corn tortillas were store bought, the toppings on the tacos did not add anything to the taco. We then decided to get chips and salsa with some of their jalapeño cheese rice. I was thinking, that's simple, no way it could be bad. They brought out pico de Gallo, not salsa. The cheese rice tasted like uncle Ben's instant rice, with a spoon of queso on top, and fresh jalapeños as garnish. \n\nTo be honest, I was disappointed because I was looking forward to having this again.",

I was so betrayed!  \n\nTuza is set up like Taquria del Sol where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  The menu is basic which I'm a fan of. I ordered queso, 2 chicken tacos and a mezcal margarita.  The mezcal margarita tasted good, but it was so small (highball glass.)  And I didn't want to go thru the hassle of getting back in line to order another one because Tuza stayed busy the entire time we were there on a Tuesday night.  \n\nThe queso was bland and I didn't finish it.  The chips were ordinary, nothing special.  The chicken tacos were so flavorless that I wanted to sob.  I hate when my whole meal is a downer, and this one was downright depressing.  My friend had a carne taco and chicken taco and she said the carne taco was marginally better than the chicken.  \n\nMaybe everyone's enamored of Tuza because it has some parking? I don't know.  Or maybe I caught them on a bad night.  Whatever it was, I'm not going back for more.",

And that is the order I liked them from fav to least fav. They were all pretty good but The crispiness of big fish and the steak taco's zesty chimichurri style sauce make these two the clear winners for me! The best part about these tacos is that they are made on delicious corn tortillas that are not grainy and can hold up to all the protein, toppings and sauces without falling apart. \n\nThe classic margaritas are delish, their sour mix is made in house so they taste really fresh and citrusy not overly sugared/syrupy. We also got queso which is standard/ good but made better with adding a few dabs of their signature hot sauce that's preset on each table. There's a good amount of indoor seating and bar seating is available. There is an outdoor patio too. The staff was attentive and the food came out quicker than expected. Overall great experience!",

The salsa was super fresh and tasty.  I had three tacos, a shrimp taco, a carnita taco, and the classic taco.  The shrimp and carnita were both really good, but the classic taco was the most interesting.  It's a hard taco shell with ground beef, lettuce and cheese, just like you probably had at a school cafeteria growing up, but so much better.  I'd go back just to order several of those.  \n\nYou order at the counter and the food comes out quickly.  They also have a full bar if you would like a drink as well as indoor and outdoor seating.  Parking is in the back and is easy.  There is a door in the back of the building near where you park that leads to a staircase up to the restaurant.\n\nI enjoyed it and will go back.  Definitely recommend you give it a try.",

        "text": "Finally a place in the perimeter that has authentic tacos. They make the tortillas in house and hand press them to order.\n\nMy favorite tacos are the big fish and steak tacos. The big fish tacos were really flaky and have a nice bite. And don't forget the queso, guac & salsa! They also recently added elotes to the menu (on the cob), which had good flavor. \n\nThe biggest selling point of this place is the tortillas. And they are gluten free.\n\nI also just love the whole vibe / color scheme of the place. They have some outdoor seating, which is a nice option as well. Plenty of seating to fit a large party too.",

        "text": "honestly, the BEST tacos i've had on the east coast!  everything was delightfully fresh, made to order, and tasted brilliant. \n\nmy husband and i ordered the big fish, carnitas, steak and shrimp - they were delicious. the carnitas was crispy and crunchy. the steak was juicy and bright. the shrimp was light and bright. and the big fish was just that! BIG! the beer battered piece was as large as tall as the taco shell when wrapped up. the batter was crunchy, yet light. we enjoyed them all, but definitely loved the fish most. \n\n3 tacos each plus queso and chips were definitely enough for lunch. initially i ordered 2 thinking i'd be a dainty lady, but my stomach got the better of me and i had Jas go back up to the front and order another big fish for me. plus the tortillas are amazing! \n\ni saw people weren't loving the $4 price tag, but considering how fresh everything was, it's definitely worth it! this will be our new go-to for tacos from here on out. \n\nthe interior is charming with bright colors, patterned floors and glass counters so you can watch everything being made. \n\nthey offer a full bar and next time i'm snagging a margarita and hubby can be the DD. and their patio, while small, is charming. i like how they chose to \"block\" out some of the main drag noises with the wooden fence. it made the patio space feel more intimate and personal. \n\nthe staff was excellent and incredibly kind. they were also very conscious not to serve anything over our baby in the carrier beneath the edge of the table - that won major brownie points from me. no complaints what so ever. \n\nTuza is located along busy howell mill road, but it is brightly colored and easy to spot. parking in the front is challenging as there are only a few spots, but never fear, there's ample room in the back. if you do park behind, you can use the back entrance and head up the stairs to find begin your delicious journey. \n\nif you're wondering if you should try this place, YES! you should. climb in the car immediately and head over for great food in a welcoming atmosphere.",

Strong margs as well!\n\nCons: ditch the bagged chips and use your handmade tortillas (cut and fried into nachos). Not sure how but the queso needs work, and less sweetness on the carnitas (balance the salt and sweet or ditch the sugar altogether) \n\nI love local shops and would enjoy this place again, hopefully this helps.",

The tacos are better than any I've had in Atlanta. Tortillas are made fresh in front of you, steak is grilled and sliced fresh for each taco, and the vegetables are all fresh. \nThe owners are friendly and highly involved, and told us about plans for a dog-friendly patio, an afternoon happy hour tapas menu, and live music at the bar in the evening. \nMy favorites so far are the steak taco, carnitas taco and fish taco",

The hand-made tortillas are better than some I've had in Mexico. The real star is the carnitas tacos. They are amazing! They have a hint of sweetness, which balances well with lime squeezed on top. The prices are very reasonable, and the decor is great. Kids will enjoy all of the selections, not just what's on the kids menu. \n\nThis is a great addition to this area. The owner is super nice, too, so go check it out, and frequent it often!",

I'm not mad about them not offering delivery, I'm Appalled the way the owner handled the call and situation.\n\nI'm sure I'll get a GREAT response from the business owner Jason just like others have.  I can't wait to hear the mumble jumble he has to say.   Don't support a business that obviously doesn't support you as a community and definitely doesn't value you as a customer!!!...\n\nJason; your mumbo-jumbo as a poor excuse and elementary level of a conversation is complete idiotic. commenting to those who actually speak up and recognize your fake ways, who do not appreciate nor value your establishment or your managing skills is beyond ridiculous! Trust and believe you may think you are a success but soon you'll see that you're a complete failure, so I hope you have a back up plan because this location will not last!.. people don't like fake, rude and especially someone who doesn't appreciate their customer base.  So enjoy your self applied success while it last the 2.5sec's before your true colors ruin it all!!..",

I remember having to listen to your rude inquiry about my decision to not use 3rd party delivery. YOU WERE ONE OF THE TWO CALLS..I am pleased that you will not be returning to our restaurant. It is a good thing that 3rd party delivery exists as it will save other staff and owners from NOT having to deal with your OBNOXIOUS unkind demeanor face to face. I hope you are safe and healthy during these difficult times and please NEVER call or come back.  I feel sorry for RReal Tacos and Velvet Taco. They are nice people doing great work and hate to think they have to deal with you often.  The ONLY reason Tuza is successful before and now during these most difficult times is MY Insistence on supporting our community and our customers you moron.

My downfall was the chicken taco, it was not seasoned to the taste and the chicken didn't seem to be cooked thoroughly so after one bite I had to trash it.

Once you've ordered  you just tell them if you're going to sit inside or outside. We choose inside because it was a little cold outside. Once inside we were greeted and given complementary bottles of water and napkins. Our food was brought to us within 5 to 10 minutes & it was wonderful! We each got 3 tacos. I got Carnitas, Chicken, and Shrimp, they were all good but the Carnitas was my favorite. My husband got Carnitas, Pork belly, and Carne asada. They were so good that my husband went & got us each 3 more. This time he got me the: Pork belly, Classic crunchy taco, and another Carnitas. I was so focused on my tacos that I don't remember what his second round was lol. The only negative thing was we ordered the regular size guacamole, and paid $7 for a small little container that should be more like $3 to $3.50. However, it did taste good. If you like authentic tacos, you have to try this place.",

Optional homemade hot sauce in the squirt bottles is equally flavorful as it is spicy. I've had the other tacos and they are good but the big fish taco holds a special place in my heart. The service is excellent as well. I really enjoy coming here. 10 out of 10 would recommend.",

My only gripe is that the tacos are smedium (four tacos provide for a satisfying meal)! The guacamole is made-to-order and is delicious as well. \n\nMargaritas are delicious and hit pretty well. \n\nI absolutely recommend Tuza, and I am a repeat customer who has always been very happy with my experience and the food.",

We finally got around to it and are glad that we did! \n\nTuza is an unassuming little place that is very affordable for the quality of food. Everything was very good and the check was light!\n\nYou order with the cashier and then find a table. They have a good variety of beers and I've heard the margaritas are great as well, but I wasn't able to try. \n\nCome check this place out if you're looking for a fast casual place that serves some solid stuff!",

Tomatoes onion lime cilantro and the guacamole was fresh with just the right amount of chunks.\n\nWe had the steak, classic, shrimp, fish tacos.  All were exactly what you want when you're looking for straight forward home made tacos.  \n\nThe rice and beans add well.  \n\nThere's a very popular taqueria not far from here where people wait in line. I finally tried it a few months ago and wasn't impressed.\n\nWill definitely come here when on the Westside.\n\nThanks for taking pride in you business Tuza!",
