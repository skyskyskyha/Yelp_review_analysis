        "text": "I am not going to lie, I walked into this place with low expectations.  My friends had dined at another location in the past and had a pretty rough experience, and we were originally going to have Thai food at another place, but I figured, hey, what the hell, why not.  I mean yes, I read all the reviews and such, and I saw the high ratings across the board, but I just kept having reservations (Will it be fresh? Will there be rock hard bread?).  Shame on me!  Needless to say, I am so glad we went, because it was a blessing in disguise.\n\nLocated on the main floor of the Hampton Inn on Piedmont (however, it looks like the main entrance is on the outside, not really sure if there is also a way in from the hotel, but I did not check), they have their own marked parking right out front.  We had a dinner reservation for 3, on the patio.  We all went in, and were greeted.  Bar to the right, nice bright dining room with checkered flooring, and then the covered patio.\n\nI heard the menu had consolidated during covid times (as my friend was hoping they had raw oysters), but that was ok, everything I was looking at was screaming, \"Tommy, eat me!\".  They also have a visual drink menu and dessert (omg) menu- which makes you want to get one of each.  I decided to start off with a bowl ($10.99) of gumbo, and the sriracha ($16.99) chicken, that came with potatoes.  My friend got the cooked oysters, and an okra plate to share.\n\nOur server Jylyn (which thats how it showed on the receipt), I won't lie, he was awesome.  He was one of the friendliest and accommodating servers I have had not only in Atlanta, but anywhere.  LB is very lucky to have him on their team.  When he asked if we had any questions about the menu, I asked about the bourbon chicken- as it came with grits.  I needed to order a togo for mom, and she wanted the chicken with corn and white rice.  I didn't even know if that would be possible, but he said it could happen without any issues at all.\n\nThe gumbo came, and along with it, some house hot sauce and crackers.  I mixed everything up, and it was great.  The rice was fresh and the flavors melded well together, with a perfect kick and no shells to worry about either.\n\nThen, the chicken and the okra came.  The okra, I really liked, I almost ate all of them even though I didn't order them, oops.  The chicken, I won't lie, I didn't know what to expect, but when they came out, I was like, \"OK\", and went to town on them.  The sauce they were topped with, I really liked, you can use that on anything, whatever it was.  Even the potatoes underneath them, I loved- and were great with that same sauce.  It also came with ketchup I threw some hot sauce with and used to switch up when needed.\n\nJylyn asked if we wanted dessert, we pretty much said shit yes.  I got the praline cheesecake, and for mom to go I got her the bread pudding and the beignets (I gave her crap for wanting 2 desserts lol).  The only real downside to my meal was the cheesecake.  It was excellent, but the praline was so thick, I had to turn it upside down so I wouldn't keep squashing the cheesecake.  I loved it though.  Jylyn then brought us the checks and the togo food.  \n\nMy only other regret was I should have tipped him more.  I mean, he got a nice tip, but was so deserving of even more.  I think I will have to come back here honestly.  Those jumbo grilled shrimp, looked like they mean business as well!  \n\nMy mom, when I brought her food, she loved everything as well.  I was almost skeptical that she wouldn't since she is very boring when it comes to flavors, but really loved the corn.  I also heard noises from upstairs when she was eating dessert, I assume she enjoyed those.  All in all, this was an excellent experience I was so glad to have, and so unexpected as well!  The reviews don't lie in this one, if you are a fan of cajun (or sweet drinks or yummy desserts), this is not to be missed!  This month, they will be celebrating a year in business at this location (one of 3, the others in Decatur and East Point)- cheers to many more!\n\nCovid notes- it looked like everyone were wearing masks when needed, and also they were doing a nice job sanitizing tables between meals, and spacing out people as needed.  I felt fairly comfortable dining here, especially on the patio.",

I started off with the crab cake and there was barely any crab inside. It was mostly the breading and I didn't even finish it. Then I had the jambalaya for dinner. It looked better than it tasted. It was very salty and I even swallow part of a shrimp shell. I didn't want to make a big deal since it was a little piece. Luckily I didn't have an allergic reaction. I'm allergic to the shell on the shellfish. Sad to say once is enough for me. I'd rather go to Pappadeaux's.",

Upon hearing this my cousin looked like she was about to burst into tears. Apparently this bread is next level delicious and the thought that her family would be missing out on tasting it brought her to tears.\n\nI hope they get the bread back soon as many of the customers told me the same thing and they were devastated.\n\nOur server was hilarious. He joked he also cried about the bread as well.\n\nI'm pleased to report there was nothing that got served that wasn't delicious. Every single entree that hit our table was absolutely wonderful. \n\nNow I would say the lamb chops were the talk of the table and my cousin obliged each of us by breaking off a small piece of the tender meat so no one missed out.\n\nSo if you're unsure of what to order you won't be disappointed if you get the lamb chops",

When I arrived around 2pm on a Saturday I was surprised it was not packed and was able to grab a seat at the bar. The bar tender was great and provided great recommendations and customer service! She was awesome! I ordered the hurricane for a drink which was Pre made but surprising good. I ordered the oysters for my appetizer and they were good and flavorful. i did feel like I did see they had a lot of oil/grease in them which was not okay to me. For my entree I ordered the shrimp étouffée, which was good as well since they did not have my first choice. I will say I wasn't wowed by the food but it was good. I will come back to check out some of their other items but honestly they won't be first on my list.",

I was excited to find that there was a buckhead location, because it's close to my job. The first time I visited this location I was delighted with my crab cakes. The second time I had them which was yesterday I was highly disappointed. They came out looking burnt. At first I thought maybe that didn't mean anything... but I'm sure it definitely scorched the taste. Also, this time around the meat didn't taste fresh... \n\nI don't know if coming earlier in the day differs from coming in towards the evening hours... but management should really have a conversation with their chef about consistency. Im like traumatized lol, don't want to order them again.\n\nI wish I would've spoken to management while I was there, but along with being dissatisfied & tired I had after 5 Atlanta traffic to deal with lol. Thought this second visit was going to make the drive better.\n\nEach time I've been at this location I sat at the bar. i haven't sat in the main dine area, each time I've visited this location I sat t the bar. I think that the bartenders shouldn't cross service whom they're serving. Not sure how tips work, but this happened during the second visit. Overall the service is moderate, and the environment is nice. \n\nJust highly disappointed with the crab cakes I had today. Check the photos below.",

We arrived at 5:55pm for a 6:00pm reservation, did not get seated until 6:20pm and did not get our first cocktail until 7:00pm. Again the restaurant was empty so this was just unacceptable. The food was authentic and delicious - but once we got our entrees they never checked on us again. Never asked if we wanted dessert and never brought us the bill. After 30 minutes I went and asked for the bill. It was a shame because the food was fantastic - this is what happens when gratuity is automatically included! They should be ashamed.",

        "text": "Maybe I was expecting more but I enjoyed my experiences better at the South Atlanta and Decatur locations. \n\nCustomer service will more than likely be the downfall in this area. It's in a great, high traffic location. \n\nI came in around 9:40pm. By 9:46pm no one had greeted me so I decided to sit at the bar. My bartender was Jomari who was responsible for taking my order. I only learned her name from the receipt not because she introduced herself. She did say hello when I walked in to the bar area though but her overall service was very dry which was offsetting and unwelcoming. Even other patrons seemed less than thrilled about her service. She didn't check in with you like is everything OK, do you need anything else. I had to flag her down when I was ready for my order with strong eye contact which she acknowledged by saying \"I'll be with you,\" ask for ice water when my mixed drink was finished. I ordered the NOLA daiquiri which I don't recommend. Not much liquor and had a strange aftertaste. I think it was the juice they used. I notice they had some juices from a can. Yikes! I wish I ordered The Hurricane instead but her response when I questioned about the two drinks was \"they're both sweet\". She didn't help with any recommendations. She just seemed like she was ready to go home. \n\nOne thing I like about this restaurant is that they continue serving until closing time. I had called before coming to ensure I would still be able to order and I was told yes. The kitchen is open up until close which is 10pm. \n\nI ordered the gator bites appetizer which is good but I wouldn't recommend ordering if Uber Eats or food delivery because it will be cold and hard by time it arrives to you. I also crawtator grouper which was good with the jalapeño grits. Very tasty! I think they messed up and attempted to serve it to go but I heard the bartender say it was ordered as a dine so I noticed the manager take the bag back and reappear with my dish a few minutes later. Luckily it wasn't thrown around. Presentation still looked good and manager (I presume he was the manager) asked me did everything look OK which I said yes. \n\nI noticed this menu didn't have the stuffed burger with crawfish. Parking is valet only. The parking lot directly in front of LA Fitness is shut down currently for construction. Then there is some garage parking but at night by yourself wouldn't recommend. Also not sure if the garage is connected to the restaurant that you don't have to walk on the Main Street to get to the restaurant. \n\nI wanted to",

I ordered the redfish with corn and sub dirty rice for white rice. I also had the shrimp and crab that comes on top of the dish, on the side since I don't eat shrimp. The meal was delicious. The fish was flaky and tender and the crab was a perfect touch to round out the dish. \n\n They also have cocktails which was really tasty (Lemon Drop martini). I will come back here for sure, plus there was plenty of parking which is not the norm for Buckhead.",

        "text": "We visited the bar for drinks and appetizers late on 7/30/23; also asked for a side house salad (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, etc) which the waitresses just didn't quite understand or provide. They looked at us like we had two heads. House salads were not on the menu (go figure) but we didn't think it was too much to ask the chef to throw one together, especially since there was hardly no one  in the restaurant. So we agreed on a Caesar salad which had wilted lettuce and not very tasty. Furthermore, the customer service was lacking; Not friendly or accommodating. However our drinks were good. This will be our last visit to this establishment considering that there are so many other choices in the area.",

We ordered the fried catfish which is served with potatoes and slaw as well as the seafood etouffee. Delicious. Definitely needed a nap after we ate! The service was great as well, and we sat on the patio. Servings were enough for 2. Parking was plentiful in the lots surrounding the location.",

        "text": "This review is about 2 month delayed but better late than never. After spending a day at Lenox Mall, we were pretty hungry (and tired) so after a bit of Yelp searching we happened across this place. There was a 20 minute wait but it was worth it. Our server was a huge plus (funny, attentive and energetic) but the food is the main attraction. I had the Hurricane for my drink and in our never ending search for good oysters we tried the Bistreaux Oysters as our appetizer, which was pretty good and I actually recommend you try that one. For the main dish I selected the Redfish Ponchartrain while my wife had the Cajun Jambalaya. While the Jambalaya was good, the redfish was unbelievable and my wife doesn't like fish but she tried mine and decided then and there that she would have that dish next time we finished. They seasoned and grilled that fish perfectly.\nOf course, a good dining experience requires a good dessert so we chose the classic beignets which came fresh and extremely hot. I would recommend this spot to anyone; didn't take more than one photo because we were pretty tired and hungry.",

Place of the time was empty yet we had to wait for quite a while. The server was incredibly slow beverages took 20 minutes at least to arrive after ordering the food was reasonably authentic, I can definitely recommend the gumbo Jambalaya was not up to my standards as a former resident of Louisiana... But was an overall crowd pleaser my group of about 12 enjoyed the food but the excessive waiting cost them business people would have ordered dessert. I had someone come back within a reasonable time of them dropping containers on the table should we want to take any food home... Dishes weren't cleared, second drinks weren't an option to order online dessert\n\nAn 18% gratuity was built in so there wasn't even any way to incentivize better service \n\nDefinitely order takeout only the restaurants in the midst of some updating, but that was not the issue at all.",

        "text": "My friend told me about this newly opened restaurant. She said she would walk over to my condo so we could walk together there.\n\nWe girls walked over this afternoon. It was a short walk and today's weather was just great! \n\nPrior to visiting, I have briefly looked through the yelps reviews and learned this restaurant serves Cajun food. \n\nAMBIENCE 5/5\nI like the bright interior. I wish they have booths that accommodate more than a party of two. The current booth seatings look tight. Overall I like the vibe here.\n\nFOOD 5/5\nI ordered the shrimp po' boy ($10.99)and my lunch buddy had a fried catfish po' boy ($10.99). \nThe food portion was generous and the shrimps was simply fresh and delicious. The baguette was so crispy and the potatoes on the side were tasty. I heard the fried catfish po' boy was wonderful too.\n\nI also ordered a cup of gumbo soup which had a generous amount of sausages and shrimps. However, I probably could not take the heat. Somewhat too spicy for me.\n\nSERVICE 5/5\nOur server Courtnay was nice and attentive. She came back and checked on us in the middle of our lunch. Not only she thanked us before we left, while heading for the door, the staff at the bar and another gentleman (possibly manager?) thanked us for our visit.\n\nThis lunch was a pleasant surprise for me. I was more like expecting my lunch to be just good but nothing out of this world. However, my lunch experience at Louisiana Bistreaux was just amazing! That shrimp po' boy was simply to die for. I am definitely returning here for another round of po' boy :D",

        "text": "What a pleasant surprise this spot was. I was in the Buckhead area and in need of a  place for lunch. This restaurant was in close proximity to where I was located so I decided to give it a try. \n\nThis restaurant is located in the shopping center with LA fitness. It's at the top of the shopping plaza,  near Rooms to go. They do have dedicated parking that is clearly marked. \n\nWhen we walked in we were immediately greeted by about threes ladies. The restaurant was not crowded so we were immediately seated. The ambiance is sophisticated, but not  stuffy. The decor includes contrasting colors, for example white walls with black trim, checker board floor with red walls for the bar area, which also includes bistro style seating. There are also beautiful light fixture, and of course the decor is complimented with hints of New Orleans flavor! You have to give credit to the masked faces on the walls.\n\nOur server was nice. She provided us with prompt service and also helped us decided what to order. My date and I decided to order the fried okra as an appetizer. A bowl of gumbo, corn chowder and the Grouper Orleans served as our main course. I am a pescatarian, so I did not try the gumbo. The corn chowder  had a very  rich taste, I am sure it is loaded with calories.  We were both pretty full after enjoying the  bowls of gumbo and chowder so we only tried the grouper dish and took the rest to go. It was really good. I did have to add a little salt and pepper to it.  I did not try dessert ( I am saying no to sweets for 30 days). However, they all look amazing. I will have to come back to try the bread pudding.  \n\nOverall I enjoyed my visit. Service met my expectations, the food quality was good and it did not break the bank. I am looking forward to patronizing this restaurant in the future.",

He also did not wear his mask the entire time working around people, food, etc as they should be.\n\nRestrooms were clear but there is only like 2 stalls and that can be a problem once the world opens back up as we are still in covid times.  \n\nOverall this place isn't bad but I'm a NOLA girl and this just didn't feel like NOLA food or hospitality to me.",
