        "text": "This is a solid spot for a cheap, healthy-ish meal in the Peachtree Hills area.  There's free parking behind the restaurant (turn into the tiny entrance just past the CVS sign), and the interior is bright and clean.  It's an order at the counter place, and though they take your name when you order, my meal always seems to be ready by the time I get to the cashier.\n\nThe menu concept is simple but flavorful.  You pick your base (greens, rice or flatbread), your wood-grilled \"protein\" (chicken, shrimp, or portabello mushroom) and then one of eight or so \"gustos,\" which are a sauce/salsa/chutney type concoction.  I love the tahini cucumber gusto with chicken over a bed of greens.  Every meal is between $9-12, and they come with a side of sweet potato chips, which are delicious and flavorful. The portions are generous - I actually wish I could skip the sweet potato chips and save a buck or two- I can never finish a full meal here.\n\nYou can follow Gusto on facebook and instagram for fun specials and buy-1-get-1 deals.  And also keep an eye out for the owner of Gusto - it's not often a former NFL quarterback opens a successful fast-casual dining spot, but it's certainly worked out here!",

        "text": "Super fresh, delicious and quick! I highly recommend gusto! for a lunch time spot. It's a twist on the QSR that we all know and love (less customization). Here's the process:\n- Open door, walk in. If you can do this, you're starting off in a good spot.\n- Pick your meat (chicken, shrimp or portobello) and this determines your price. Chicken is the cheapest ($8.99).\n- Pick your \"gusto\" which is the flavor combination. The gusto determines the ethnic cuisine of choice. I went with the Mediterranean gusto which had hummus, Mediterranean salsa (cucumber, tomato, chickpeas and tahini) and topped off with feta. You can't really change this too much as the ingredients are limited. \n- The combination can go on a salad, brown rice or in a wrap.\n- Sit, enjoy, repeat.",

My favourite is the tahini cucumber feta wrap with chicken which low-key reminds me of shawarma. It is a healthy and refreshing meal. I've tried the chipotle mango avocado bowl and the sweet soy sriracha wrap with chicken, both of which tastes really good. They serve complimentary sweet potato chips with every bowl and wrap which is absolutely delicious! They used to serve these chips in an open paper bag in the past but now they serve it in their own chip bags. \n\nThe only drawback is that the portion sizes are quite small and not filling. I would've given 5/5 if they increase their portion sizes. 5/5 for taste though.",

We missed it and just parked a few doors down at Chic fil a. Not a big deal as I got some steps in. \n\nWe walked in and the place has a very open space, cool decor, quotes on the wall etc. (see pics), and it smelled heavenly. No other customers were there although they came later, so we were first in line. \n\nThe set up is similar to Chipotle. So you decide on your choice of greens or brown rice or flatbread or half/half, next you choose your protein - chicken, shrimp, or portabella. Then You choose  your dressing or sauce. Your meal then comes with complimentary sweet potato chips. \n\nI had the greens with shrimp and a tahini cucumber feta dressing with a limeade. - Yummy! The only drawback for me was that it seemed like it was a very small portion while my sisters meal was huge. She ordered the greens with chicken and apple curry peanut dressing. - she LOVED IT. I tasted it and it was really good. Huge pieces of chicken. Limeade was refreshing. \n\nEverything was explained to us by the cashier perfectly. Very courteous and friendly service. Our meal was prepared and ready super quick. \n\nThey have stool seating facing the street of you want to people watch or you can sit outside on a nice day. We sat inside and took our time and chatted. It was a good outing. \n\nI'll be back.",

        "text": "Since Gusto opened last October, we have become huge fans of relatively every aspect of this business and it has become a mainstay for lunch to-go with our new little guy. Not only does Gusto top the charts on consistency and approachability, but the flavors and delivery are thoroughly thought out and completely streamlined every single day. It's a well-oiled machine that appears to be a brand with serious tenure, but this place is a standalone with just over six months of business. You'd never suspect their (beautifully) true identity -- a completely local, ATL business. \n\nAll of the \"gustos,\" or flavor combinations, are much more complex than just a sauce. Each one is a combination of multiple flavors, vegetables, and spices that work rather well on any of the protein choices (chicken, shrimp, or portobello). My go-to tends to be the Chipotle Mango, but the Tahini Cucumber and Curry are also favorites. When I'm in the mood for a guilty pleasure, the Buffalo Buttermilk Bleu is choice. The truth it, I'm a fan of them all. I'd be happy with any of them on any given day. I will say, however, I can't get away from ordering my meal on a flatbread. I dig the rice and salad bowls, but the flatbread is so chewy and hearty. \n\nNow, the biggest reason Gusto makes such a difference is in the ownership/management -- Nate Hybl. I've had the pleasure of visiting so many restaurants and even working for a few over the years and I've never met anyone like Nate. Someone who is so dedicated to quality and consistency and is equally dedicated to being present through every day of business that he possibly can. Upon every visit, Nate not only has his staff constantly working on prep, or cleaning, or taking care of customers, but he is doing the exact same. I've seen that guy take up more garbage from tables and run a mop than I've ever seen any other owner think about doing so. The guy is one of the hardest working people I've seen. His passion is definitely what fuels the restaurant. \n\nBONUS: I'm not sure how long they'll be around, but if you have a sweet tooth, you should definitely get your hands on one of the Buckley Bars (basically a homemade Snickers) and horde it all for yourself. Should they no longer have these delightful snacks, grab one of the cookies at the register. They are baked locally and are fantastic. The lemon cookie is my favorite. \n\nI can't wait to see how Gusto grows throughout the next couple of years. The simplicity alone is worth becoming a regular.",

        "text": "Their chicken rice bowls are out of this world!!! Gusto cooks their chickens on a wood grill and the results are incredible: slight char & smokey perfection. In short, the food here is fast, healthy, and tastes great. I think I found my new favorite lunch place.\n\nThe location isn't my favorite, it's located in a small busy strip mall dominated by CVS. Not really a walkable nor bikeable area. If you drive there, parking is located in the rear of the building. Once there, you'll be greeted by the large menu display on the wall. Pretty simple process: \n\n1. You choose a base carb (Flatbread wrap, brown rice, mixed greens)\n2. Choose a protein (Chicken, Portabella, Shrimp)\n3. Sauce (About 8 choices and sometimes an advertised special)\n\nMy favorite thing to get so far is the Chicken with Brown Rice, topped with Chipotle Mango Avocado. Not too smokey, not too sweet, it strikes a perfect balance of flavors. If it's your first time here, I highly recommend this combination to start. With your meal, you also get a side of sweet potato chips which too, are perfectly prepared: salty, crunchy, and thin chips. Very addicting.\n\nIf you need to switch things up from the usual lunch routine (you know, the Chipotle burrito bowl) come check this place out, you surely won't regret it. I only wish they had more protein options.",

        "text": "My gusto! experience went okay. This place was kind of like Chiptole but with simpler operations. You pick either brown rice, mixed greens, or flatbread wrap to begin with. And then you choose your protein - they have portabella, chicken, and shrimp. And then you pick your \"sauces.\" They've got 6 or 7 different options. I ended up choosing half brown rice and half mixed greens with grilled chicken. For the sauces, I went with Chipotle Mango Avocado. It came with Chipotle cream sauce, avocado, mango, black bean, corn salad, jack cheese, and in a cilantro lime dressing. I didn't notice that there was black bean in it, which I don't eat... so I had to take all of them out one by one (there were actually a lot). The sauce was a little light so my meal was a little dry. Ingredients were fresh with lots of protein/chicken added. However, the rest ingredients were somewhat lacking. They also included a small bag of complimentary sweet potato chip.  \n\nOverall, I am not sure if my gusto! experience matched what I had expected based on my yelp research. Their selections of ingredients were way limited than Chipotle's and all \"pre-programmed.\" Definitely less flexibility here - you also can't take out certain ingredients that you don't eat. Their food was fresh and protein (chicken) tasted great. But other than protein, everything else tasted just so-so. They are pretty inventive for the sauce options though! Personally, I think would probably still stick to Chipotle.",

        "text": "Gusto Wood Fire Grill is consistently referred to as being like \"Chipotle\".  Saying that Gusto tastes like Chipotle is like generally saying a food tastes like chicken.  Yes, it's a casual dining restaurant that serves rice bowls, salad, and wraps.  And yes, you can choose what goes inside.  But the similarities end here.\n\nThe protein selection is more limited.  At Chipotle, you can choose between barbacoa, chicken, carnitas, steak, and vegetables.  At Gusto, you can choose between chicken, portabella, and shrimp.  There's only brown rice, salad, or a flatbread wrap here.  The coolest part - and in my opinion the most innovative part of the restaurant - are the gustos.  At Chipotle, you'll dump different combinations of cheese, guacamole, and salsa... and really, you don't get anything vastly different unless you switch up the meat.  The \"gustos\" at this restaurant have flavors from different cuisines - Thai, Mediterranean, and American, just to name a few.    All are well thought out and served with fresh ingredients.  The chicken is well marinated and juicy.  In addition, you get  sweet potato chips on the side. A side salad or grape cup are a little extra.\n\nMy two favorite are the chipotle mango avocado and the apple curry peanut, but you can't really go wrong with any of them.  Gusto also sells frozen yogurt for dessert.  If you want a casual meal that's not Chipotle... then you should consider trying this place out.",

I quickly walked in and one of the workers kindly let me know there is parking behind the building. Make sure you turn between the Piedmont office building and CVS, not the Chick-fil-A road!\n\nI came in during the peak of rush hour, and for a Friday evening, this place was sadly empty, but was most likely due to the fact that it was sleeting just a bit outside. The cashier and cooks were eagerly awaiting my order. I received my order in literally 5 minutes. Everything came in cute environmentally friendly containers and recycled baggies.\n\nThis would be the perfect spot for lunch with one friend or more (especially with peeps who are health-conscious!). First, order a style (greens, grains, bread, flatbread). Then, order your protein! Finally, order your gusto aka zesty sauce combos. I chose grains with portabella mushrooms and the chipotle mango avocado gusto. My choice appeared to be two separate things--like a chipotle sauce and an avocado/mango salsa with black beans and corn (oh, and with both mashed + chunks of avocados!!). An additional plus I wasn't expecting: my meal came with a free side of sweet potato chips. Simple, clean, and yummy.",

There are real gluten free options, vegan options , and carnivore options. This is a good place if your really hungry and want a hearty meal but it won't kill your diet or void your workout either. \n\nGusto was fantastic, it's the type of food that I would cook at home but way better. It's basically bowls of rice or veggies or greens with meat and other goodies added in. \n\nMy first time I was a bit confused because I couldn't figure out what to do. Basically, pick what you want as a base and then add toppings. Think of it as a much healthier version of one of those popular ice cream parlors where the fruit and candy is mixed in except with no ice cream, or sugar or candy. And the food is hot not cold. Ok, so this may be a bad example. But it's kinda like that.  The good news is that you can create your own or pick one from the menu. \n\nI tried the tahini cucumber feta ( my new fav). The chicken on top had this delicious \"Woodfire\" taste and the blend of the other ingredients were really moving (I couldn't think of better adjectives: sorry).Tasty! The chili citrus BBQ, chipotle mango avocado, and Apple curry peanut are also really tasty. \n\nI like the vibe of the place and did notice the music when I walked in. Very nice.\n\nThere are a ton of options and if your not sure what you want or the ingredients just ask the staff and they will help you out!\n\nEnjoy!!",

I was very pleased with the staff, environment, and food both times I was here! \n\nNote: Gusto is kind of hidden. If I wasn't looking for it, I'd have zoomed by it. Keep an eye out!\n\nParking - Gusto does have parking in the back - it shares the lot with CVS. So beware! It may be full, but it'll change up every few mins probably since CVSers come in and out quickly. OR if you really want to, you can park in front of Gusto's. But that parking is metered street parking. Don't forget! I'm sure everyone knows how it feels to come a minute too late before a ticket is written.... \n\nSpace - Inside there is plenty of seating. Several 2 man tables, 4 tables, and a higher table near the ordering area that sits probably 10-12 people. Definitely won't be waiting for a table! I think I'd like the higher tables since.... they do have purse hooks :D This made my eating experience better haha. I HATE awkwardly placing my purse on my hand/near the table whenever I eat. It makes me happy Gusto definitely changed its game in that sense. :D #browniepoints \n\nFood- \n\nI've tried 4 different bowls: \n- Tahini Cucumber\n- Chile Citrus BBQ\n- Chipotle Mango Avocado\n- Apple Curry Peanut\n\nI really want to pick a favorite, but I can't. :P They were all good. Although my taste preference kind of leans towards the Chile Citrus BBQ. I really like how the sauce tastes. OH - and they do give very generous portions in each meal. My bf had their flat bread while I had the Chile Citrus BBQ Bowl - we were both full. AND their house made sweet potato chips are SUPER good. That was also given in generous portions. If you're really looking for something quick, healthy, and not your typical subway-isn food, I'd hit up Gusto's.  \n\nI'm a lover of Chipotle and Willies, but I'm glad something healthier has coming along to ATL. I'll definitely be back!",

It also came with free chips. Everything was tasty. \n\nWhen I asked if I could do both portobello and shrimp, they said yes. No one told me that there would be an up-charge. I just assumed it would be $10 (halfway between the individual prices, since they would be putting half and half). I didn't find out I would be charged extra until my order was already placed and I had to pay. \n\nI ordered food to go, and it was all prepared in about 2 minutes. I did noticed however, that I received less portion in my bowl than the people who were eating there. \n\nI'd like to return to try diff flavor/ingredients. However, I'm not too happy about the surprise up-charge.",

They give you healthier options without compromising on the flavor. \n\nI had the fresh medley with chicken and chipotle mango avocado.  The salad was good by itself  but the sauce that comes on the side was so good I forgot I was eating a salad.  That's coming from a guy who doesn't like Salad.  \n\nMy girlfriend had the same except topped hers with tomato tzatziki.  She couldn't stop talking about how fresh and savory it all tasted.  She hates sweet potato chips, and finished every one of these.  True meaning of no man left behind. \n\nWe finished the meal with the frozen yogurt.  The peanut butter and chocolate swirl was on par with Pinkberry.  For those of you who a know about the frozen yogurt game here in Atlanta you know that's a bold statement.  \n\nIf you are unsure about where to start, ask for Boston.  He was super helpful, definitely won't steer you wrong. Super nice to.  (he let me in on a secret: dip the potato chips in the yogurt.  Perfect combination of salty and sweet!) \nWe will be back real soon.",

You always get a side of sweet potato chips. What's not to love?\n\nI always order a bed of half mixed greens and half brown rice. There's also the choice to get a flatbread wrap which I've heard is good. I admittedly have only ever tried the grilled portabella even though there's also a choice of grilled chicken or shrimp. (I can never bring myself to try anything else because the portabella is BOMB.) Then you can choose from a variety of sauces/toppings. My favorite (okay, so I've only ever tried this one...) is the chipotle mango avocado. This is literally my favorite go-to fresh/healthy/filling meal that I could eat every day probably.\n\nA couple other things to note:\n- service is fast!!!!!!!!!\n- service is also really nice\n- free parking lot behind the restaurant",

Well, I'll try.\nFirst off, it feels like you are getting a totally different meal every time because of the \"gusto\" toppings..one day you may feel a little tex-mex, one day you may be craving asian, one day you may want that sports bar buffalo wing flavor. Gusto has you covered. If you want to be healthy, get lettuce. Semi healthy, get lettuce + rice, Tasty - get rice, and even tastier im sure is the flatbread. \n\nThe sweet potato chips are oh-so yummy and provide that necessary crunch.\nAlso if they have a cookie or brownie at checkout - GET IT. So delish. \nI love that they serve beer and wine if you choose to dine in.\nTakeout is quick, i mean SPEEDY quick, you'll be back in your car in less than 3 minutes. \n\nI could go on and on. My boyfriend laughs that I suggest \"gusto\" 99% of the time we are looking for somewhere to eat. Ugh, its so good. I think I'll have it for dinner, again.",

They have different styles that you can get in a wrap, with mixed greens, brown rice, or a mixture of brown rice and greens. Your protein options are chicken, shrimp, or portabella mushrooms. I'm fond of the sweet soy sriracha and the chipotle mango avocado varieties. \n\nLogistically, there's street parking and parking behind the building. Your entree comes with sweet potato chips, which are great. My one issue with Gusto is that it gets pretty crazy during lunchtime and they occasionally make mistakes on your orders. I've left and realized that they gave me completely the wrong order before or left off things that I wanted. Take gusto at face value, enjoy, and check to make sure your order is right before you leave.",

I was in the process of fighting Friday afternoon rush hour traffic, which was made even worse by a rainstorm. Needless to say, I was looking for a pick-me-up and Gusto was just that.\n\nI could smell the wood fire grilled goodness as soon as I walked in. Fortunately, most of Atlanta was stuck on the road so there were very few people in the restaurant and I could quickly place my to-go order.\n\nAlthough the protein choices are limited, they are all proteins that I love--chicken, portabella, and shrimp. I ordered a chicken flatbread wrap with chipotle avacado mango 'gusto' and a rice bowl with shrimp and buffalo buttermilk blue 'gusto'. Both entrees came with sweet potato chips.\n\nThe shrimp wasn't cooked yet, so I had to wait a bit. But the gentleman that rang up my order was kind enough to give me a free drink to enjoy while I waited. It's the little things that can make a big impact.\n\nAs for the food...the flatbread wrap was really delicious. Unfortunately, I'm a complete punk when it comes to spicy food and I couldn't eat the rice bowl. But it was nice to look at haha. All of the ingredients were fresh, and I didn't have that guilty feeling afterwards. Sounds like winning to me!",

        "text": "Can you eat healthier fast food? That's the question that former quarterback Nate Hybl seems to be trying to answer with his new restaurant 'Gusto! Wood fire grill'. No, this has nothing to do with Wood fire grill on chesire bridge - so to avoid confusion, I am just going to address it as Gusto grill! \n\nWe received an invitation for a VIP preview party at gusto! to taste the flavors before their opening to business on 10/31/2014.  so I'm going to limit the scope of my review only to taste, concept and ambiance, rather than our experience at VIP preview party.(I may update other sections when I go back again - I will)\n\nIt's located at the peachtree street not too far from another new restaurant Cafe Moulin rouge and right across street from Piedmont hospital. You can't miss the Gusto! Parking is in the back - if you are coming from buford hwy, it's after you pass the restaurant on right(you won't miss it with bright yellow branding) and of course if you driving from opposite side, parking will be on left, soon after you pass brighton rd NE. Whatever you do, just don't park at Wendy's - they are very vigilant and boot cars regularly. \n\nOther than obvious big name of the owner, the restaurant kitchen is run by former sous chef of 'General Muir' restaurant, Shawn Grodensky. The menu provides a way to build our own rice bowls, salads, sandwiches or wraps along with list of grilled proteins, different sauces(what's your Gusto!) and other garnishments. They also have very basic desserts like froyo and cookies - nothing too fattening. And their sides, you guessed it - also very healthy, like side salads, cups of grapes. \n\nOn the day of our preview party, I had a chance to chat with the Owner, Nate Hybl. I asked the obvious question that would pop up on everyone's mind - why this concept? why healthy fast food? why not some fine-dining restaurant?  \"Well..\", he started. \"I like fine dining places but I don't know the food intimately. This is what I know and I am only comfortable doing what I know well\", he continued. \nAs for the healthy fast food concept, he pointed that there aren't many options for people-on-the-go to eat healthy food; so they end up eating unhealthy options or just eat some cold salads. He mentioned, at Gusto! grill one doesn't have to make that compromise. He also said he is going to be at the joint every day working! It's his brain child, he wants it to be taken care well. \n\nOne section of the interior is occupied by the big open kitchen and the counter where you place order. For quick eating, there are large tables with yellow bar stools and counters facing windows with bar stools. There is also another section with regular tables and chairs as well. They also have outdoor seating with different table/chair options with umbrellas(yes, you guessed it - in yellow) - this would be nice for summer. \n\nWe have tried the following,\n1)  Chile citrus BBQ with chicken \n2)  Tahini cucumber Feta with shrimp\n3)  Apple curry peanut with portobello\n4) Peanut/chocolate frozen yogurt. \n\nMy favorite among this is chile citrus BBQ with chicken - it's made with spicy korean bbq sauce, cilantro, carrot & radish. While chicken is very tender, what impressed me was the complex flavor they managed to achieve with other ingredients - yet it's a very simple dish. \n\nMy another favorite was tahini cucumber Feta with shrimp and it has chickpeas as well for upping the protein content in it. It was on other side of the spectrum compared to chile citrus bbq dish, in terms of flavors. \n\nApple curry peanut with portobello was okay, but then I am not usually big fan of peanuts in my food(unless it's in my dessert).\n\nI was very impressed by the peanut/chocolate swirl froyo - it didn't not taste like frozen yogurt at all and I almost thought I was eating just a regular swirl! I was told they worked on it so much to get it just right. Kudos. \n\nAnd the place is kids friendly with kids menu as well. \n\nOverall, I like the concept and I liked what I tasted so far. But we need to see how execution is going to be and how consistent the quality will be in a long run. \n\n4 stars",

        "text": "Gusto! woodfire grill opened on Oct. 31, 2014. I was lucky enough to get invited to their preview party where I was able to sample a bunch of their \"gustos\" (flavor profiles) as well as their sweet potato chips and all of their desserts. On the way out, we were given a bag of their sweet potato chips as well as a 2 eat free coupon. Well, the food was so good that I went back this past Saturday with my roommate. There were a couple of gustos that they weren't offering at the preview that I really wanted to try. \n\nLOCATION \nThere's a parking lot in the back and street parking out front (if you really want to fork over a couple of bucks to the city of Atlanta). Because of the parking lot in the back, I wouldn't say it's hard to get in/get out of this area.\n\nATMOSPHERE\nThe place is spacious, and very modern. It reminds me of a converted open warehouse with its high ceilings and pipes running across the top. The one quip I have about their seating is that I really dislike the bar stools near the counter. They're glued to the floor and I feel like they're too close to each other. But that just could be me. While it's fast casual, I think you could still bring a date here. Maybe not a first date but I think the concept is fun enough and the food is good enough if this wasn't the only stop on your date\n\nORDERING\nThere is no wait staff (per se) at gusto. You order at the counter and they have a sheet that they mark your options on and by the time you get down to the register, your food is pretty much done. This is awesome if you're trying to just get in and get out on your lunch break. You aren't allowed any substitutions in your gusto, BUT the gusto is made up of three components: a sauce + a salad + a garnish. I believe you technically are allowed to mix and match those three, just not individual components of the salad. \n\nFOOD\nI love the simplicity of the food, not the flavors, but the concept. You have three choices to make, salad, rice bowl, sandwich, or flatbread (think gyro/shwarma). Next you pick a protein, and they only offer chicken, portabella mushroom, or shrimp. Finally you have a choice of gusto. They have flavor profiles from all over the world. Below are the list of gustos that I've tried. \n\ntahini cucumber feta\nchili citrus bbq\nchipotle mango avocado\napple curry peanut\nspiced tomato tzatziki\n\nI've tried the chicken and the portabella protein, but only the rice bowl. I'm a nut for rice. Side note, I love that they play up the healthy option by offering only brown rice.\n\nFrom the list, I'd say the tahini cucumber feta and the chipotle mango avocado are my two favorites. The chipotle mango avocado is going to be reminiscent of your Chipotle burrito bowl, with a tangy sweetness from the mango. The apple curry peanut is a milder curry, sans coconut milk, I believe. Chili citrus bbq is going to be very much like the marinade on kalbi ribs or bulgogi. It's similar to a bibimbap bowl. Finally, the spiced tomato tzaziki has a nice yogurt tang but the smoky flavor of cumin. I think the spiced comes from the slight hint of cinnamon. \n\nCurrently, they have four dessert options -- Mexican chocolate chip cookie, lemon butter cookie, and chocolate or peanut butter frozen yogurt. The lemon butter is probably my favorite cookie. It's similar to a Danish butter cookie from the tins, but instead it's SOFT. The peanut butter froyo is also delicious.\n\nOne suggestion I have would be to open up more options for gluten or dairy free people. I know this would involve adjustments on the individual gustos, but I think it would be something to consider down the road.\n\nOverall, there are a lot of flavor profiles offered and execution has been on point thus far. The price point is a little high for the amount offered (I'm thinking compared to the Chipotle burrito bowl), so this couldn't be a regular spot for me, but definitely a place to hit up every now and then.\n\nTLDR; Come for lunch with the coworkers, and find your gusto!",

        "text": "I love Gusto! The food is healthy, delicious, inexpensive, and quick. The concept is similar to Chipotle, but with more options and more flavor.\n \nI had a tahini cucumber feta bowl with shrimp and rice and a side of sweet potato chips. The bowl had shrimp, lots of fresh veggies, chickpeas, and hummus topped with balsamic vinaigrette. It was a unique and tasty blend of flavors! I love that they use quality ingredients and have several gluten free options. \n\nThe atmosphere was casual and inviting. I was impressed to see the owner, Nate, working on the food line. Nate and the employees are warm, friendly, and passionate about delivering quality food. I highly recommend it! :)",

        "text": "gusto! is on the top of my list for the convenient lunch options. It's fast, casual and healthy. I definitely prefer this over chipotle because of the variety of flavors. \nYou fill out the form at the counter for a carb option, salad, or half and half as the base. Then you pick a protein, which ranges from chicken, shrimp or portabello. I always choose the portabello and do a half and half base with Tahini Cucumber Feta as the gusto.\n\nThe \"gusto\" option offers Tahini Cucumber Feta, Chile Citrus BBQ, Buffalo Buttermilk Blue, Chipotle Mango Avocado, Apple Curry Peanut, Soy Sriracha and Tomato Tzatziki. I haven't tried much outside of the Tahini cucumber but I heard the next go to would be Sweet Soy Sriracha. \nI use to order from gusto! a lot when it was on UberEats, now they switched to postmates and I find the delivery fee to be a bit steep unless my coworkers and I order together. While the one on ponce is closest to my office, it can be inconvenient to drive out when i'm crunched on time prior to meetings scheduled. It's a great spot for healthy quick eats and the price point is $9-$11 average for a bowl.",
