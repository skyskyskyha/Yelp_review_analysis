                "text": "Best meal we've had in Atlanta, ever!\n\nMy partner and I made reservations at the Betty and are so glad we did.\n\nThe service was impeccable. The staff were so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. They have a great wine/drinks menu -- I had the Sancerre which was perfect.\n\nWe ordered the duck and pork chop as our mains-- everything perfectly cooked, not over or under done. The flavors were so complex and beautifully layered. The greens braised in coconut milk and spices. We also had a roasted cauliflower bisque which was AMAZING. So good. \n\nThe food, ambiance, really such a special culinary experience. \n\nWe can't wait to come back.  \n\nThe only regret was not taking pictures but we were so busy eating and enjoying everything. But the decor and plating of the food was so beautifully done.",

Thursday nights are \"Jazz Night\"; live jazz and really good food were the perfect combination!\nMy wife isn't easily impressed, but she liked our date night. Our server was very friendly and attentive; she wasn't pushy, and she wasn't MIA. \nWe started with the Deviled eggs - the smoked salmon and caviar was amazing! We ordered the steak and fries, and we loved it! It was a very nice date venue, and we plan on coming back with friends. They validate the valet parking (cost just  $10.00 to park).",

                "text": "The Betty is the perfect dinner spot for a swanky dining experience in the heart of Buckhead. \n\nParking is valet only but discounted if you dine in with the Betty. So it's always a plus to grab a bite to eat or a quick drink at the Betty before or after your visit to Willow Bar or St. Julep. Otherwise, I recommend street parking right across the street from the hotel for free and walking over to avoid worrying about that at all (I've made that mistake a few times now and never again). \n\nI made a reservation to celebrate my 30th birthday here and invited a few friends to join me. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share and try. Everything we tried was delicious and beautifully presented. Loved the hamachi crudo and the pastas (cappelletti & spaghetti) were both tasty. The presentation on the sea scallops was gorgeous. The 32 oz prime ribeye was $169 - a bit pricy for what it was. It was super fatty (although I do enjoy my beef marbled) but since I ordered it medium rare, parts of the meat were borderline not rendered fully. But I loved the roasted garlic and madeira jus. My only other complaint were the sizes of the dishes overall were a little small for the price but otherwise a great meal. \n\nThe meal isn't cheap but I definitely recommend experiencing it at least once on a special occasion.",

Service was wonderful from beginning to end.  We were warmly and immediately greeted upon arrival.  We didn't have to wait long at all to get seated.  Gregory took care of us the whole dining experience.  He came by often to check in with us which was so nice.  He made our dining experience very special.  \n\nThe interior is so stylish and really liked the vibe here especially in the hotel where this restaurant is located in.\n\nThey had a special Valentine's Day set menu which came with a glass of champagne or another non alcoholic option.  Loved that inclusive option of the non alcoholic drink!  I really liked all the options you could choose from even with the prix fixe menu.  With anticipation we waited for each beautiful food creation.  I have to especially give a special shout-out for the cool truffle presentation when you order it extra to top your food as well as the collard greens and mashed potatoes.  I'm a sides girl and loved both so much.  I'm a huge fan of greens and I absolutely loved The Betty's braised greens.  For our entrees we went with the pasta and skirt steak.  I really enjoyed the pasta dish and the steak was perfectly cooked.  The pasta also came with truffle.  The amuse of the beet cured salmon was so beautiful and honestly we could've probably had a whole tray of them.  They were esthetically on point.  I enjoyed the beef wagyu tartare that we ordered for the first round.  Now, I have to talk about the desserts that night.   Damn.  They were so so beautiful and tasted great!  I'm a huge strawberry lover and really loved the balance of flavor and combination of that dessert.  The other dessert we selected was a passion fruit one and that was so yummy too.  Felt like we were transported to a tropical island to have the freshest passion fruit ever.  Both were a great ending to our dining experience.  \n\nI hope to make it back to try some of their other menu items and especially looking forward to The Betty's other dessert options.\n\nA dope mention- I read that The Betty's and Ronald Hsu is a James Beard award semifinalist!  So awesome!  \n\nOne thing to note- Unfortunately they do not offer valet reimbursement so be prepared to pay $10 to park valet.  Please remember to bring cash to tip for valet.  There was not an option to add tip on the receipt when paying for valet with a credit card.",

The dim lighting, the place setting. But the down side is this restaurant is cozy. Not much privacy will be offered as they attempting to maximize the space. \n\nThe food... Well I didn't check the menu prior to going which is totally my fault. So if you are a pescatarian I don't know if this is the best food option unfortunately. But I made the best of my experience. The bread was ummmm... interesting to say the least and not even sure that's the term I prefer to use. But yeah not exactly my favorite! We moved the next menu item which was the Hamachi Crudo, this by far my favorite dish of the night. The yellowtail was delectable, super fresh and sliced perfectly (I love a good steak cut). The aioli and lime was a match I didn't know I needed, mainly because I hate lime but this was delicious and refreshing 100/10 recommend. We also ordered the Mushroom risotto and the crab bisque. Okay so the risotto was FIREEE! Packed with flavor. And it's not technically a risotto the server explained it's a rice that they build up to give it that risotto-like consistency but either way it's so damn good! I mean this is a dish you can't go wrong with. 10/10 recommend for sure. The crab bisque... EHHHH! So I feel this could've been better if it actually had jumbo lump crab meat, but it did have the taste of blue crab. But the smoked trout roe was a needed element and the cr\u00e8me fraiche was the cooling factor similar effect of sour cream on chili. \n\nThe parking is a breeze, just simply pull up. Valet will take it from there. I absolutely love the valet here. You can text them as your wrapping up dinner and they text you once your car is out front. They also provide the option pay to in advance. and its only $10.",

Bloody Mary was yummy too. \nI took a star away (and maybe should take two) because of valet. One issue is having to pay $10 for valet when having a full meal/not staying at the hotel and the restaurant not offering any sort of discount. The second is my car was returned to me COVERED with bird poop!! We had 5 cars in our party and mine was the only one. And the valet didn't even acknowledge the issue, just tried to walk away after handing me the key. So not only did I pay for the ability to eat at the establishment, I then had to pay to get my car washed!!",

One of the factors that keeps me coming back for more is their menu, which is always changing so it's a different experience every time!\n\nSome of my favorites so far has been the seafood roast, lasagna rotolo, hamachi, and crab spaghetti.  Drink wise, the Retropolitan and the Pink Squirrel were the perfect cocktails. \n\nAfter a nice meal, enjoy the Atlanta skylines by going up to the rooftop bar at the hotel, St. Julep!",

                "text": "Found this place on Yelp, 4.5 stars overall? I decided I need to check out this place. I live really close to this place but I never know there is a hotel off East Paces Ferry. I finally know why. The Sobu Flats has been converted into a hotel called Kimpton Sylvan Hotel. Interesting. Upon entering walked into the hotel (The Betty is located inside the hotel), the extremely staff at the front desk greeted us and asked if we were heading to The Betty. So once you enter the hotel, turn left and the restaurant would be on the right at the end of the hallway.\n\nFOOD 4/5\nI ordered the Shrimp & Grits. The staff has told me there was this cajun bbq sauce in it which made it a little spicy. After checking it would not be too spicy, I was looking forward to trying out the shrimp & grits here. All of us enjoyed our brunch (Lobster Spaghetti, Mushroom Omelette, and French Toast). Three of us ordered the Orange Mango. Those juice, unfortunately, left a lot to be desired. There was too much ice and did not taste like anything. One of us even went further and said they tasted like some bad grocery store juice :(\n\nAMBIANCE 4/5\nThe ambiance was good. Nothing really to complain about. I wish the entire back of the chair was covered. I could not put my bag behind me without the possibility of it falling on the floor. \n\nSERVICE 4/5\nOur server, John, was very nice and friendly. The kitchen did not follow instructions though. One of us had a nut allergy but the kitchen still decided to put academic nuts on her french toast. I was quick to spot those nuts when the hostess was about to put that plate of french toast on the table. She quickly apologized and immediately removed the plate when we stopped her. She came back and told her the kitchen would make a new order of toast. Our server came and apologized, mentioned they put in the order with the right instructions. Oh well, sometimes kitchens do mess up orders like in many restaurants but they really needed to be careful when we talking about food allergies here.\n\nIt was overall a good place for brunch! So 4 stars from me to The Betty!",

It also has booths for proper seating. \n\nI ordered the original martini($16) which was made well.  We ordered the cauliflower(fave dish), the duck, the chicken, and asparagus. The chicken was a large portion and the duck was very small. I think the entire menu is overpriced for what they offer, but the vibe was nice inside. There's nothing I'm eager to return to but it was fine. Service was a bit slow as I think they were understaffed. \n\nReservations are recommended! Valet is $5(and may be validated but I forgot to ask).",

Flavor, texture, presentation, is perfection. We agreed that the remaining citrus and poppy aioli(?) was worth drinking, and when the waiter came to remove the platter he joked that he takes knives first in case we're too reluctant to part with those leftovers.\nEntrees came as small portions and were slightly less enjoyable, so indulge in multiple starters. The short ribs are more like a nice Sunday roast than the fall apart melt-in-your-mouth experience I was expecting, and the accompanying greens were good but shockingly bright/raw tasting. Cocktails were well balanced. The lemon br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake was a superb finish.",

This was a concern for us since this is part of a hotel.\nNo hotel lobby feel here \nNia was our server and treated us very well. She had a very upbeat and positive energy and personality. \nWe ordered the broiled salmon salad and the shrimp and grits. Both dishes were excellent. The salmon was perfectly cooked. The grits were top notch, and yes plenty of shrimp. Additionally there was also a bread basket with house made small muffins, bisciuts and pound cake. AND a plate of deviled eggs topped with smoked salmon.\nand if that wasn't enough a glass of champagne for both of us.\nThe Betty is a well run establishment that I hope will be here a long while.

This is where things went downhill.  The menu presented was a preset menu.  The options to choose from were very limited and very elementary. The fish was terrible, grainy, and over seasoned. My flank steak was tough and grizzly. The side items arrived cold...our server did correct that by replacing the items that made it to our table warm.  Our last course, deserts, a cheesecake that was served still partially frozen, and a chocolate mousse that turned out to be more of a soft brownie texture made me realize that this establishment was ill prepared for the evening.  Not at all the experience we were hoping for, especially on a special evening. \nCould this have been an off night,  yes, but at our $$$.",

The manager came by our table and chatted for a few moments and actually shared some fun facts about the hotel amd sister properties.  We are locals and always enjoy a little tea in the neighborhood. :)  We ordered 2 entrees and 2 sides.  Note to self: The portions are generous and we weren't able to finish our meals although they were delicious!  We had the  Hamachi Crudo and it was good. We did feel that the portion wasn't as generous though. \nFor Entrees we had the Basil Speghetti and the Halibut. Both very good! There were two tiny baby shrimp with the pasta dish.  We also had the Cucumbers and Crispy potatoes for our sides. There was enough for 6 people so we didn't finish those.  They were good just too much. Overall a good experience and would definitely try it again. Thank you!",

                "text": "Came here with my in-laws for cocktails a few nights ago. Had a guy bartender (longish curly black hair, black glasses) who was incredibly impatient & disrespectful towards me when I told him I had a food allergy. I bartend in NYC & I deal with ridiculous diets all the time, but I manage by being polite in a high pace atmosphere, with tourists, all while doing my best to make suggestions or substitutions. I asked what I could have on the food menu & he replied with \"well that would depend on the ingredients now wouldn't it?\" ... without any actual guidance. I had to press him to ask the kitchen because his knowledge was no help.\nAnother time that night I asked for a mezcal cosmo. If someone comes to me with the same allergy I have (glutens & grains) I know to substitute certain ingredients to fit their needs (ie. subbing the triple sec / Cointreau out for simple syrup). He makes me a regular cosmo with vodka (which I can't have) & with Cointreau. I taste it to make sure it's actually mezcal because he seemed overwhelmed & wasn't sure if he remembered my order. Ok so I make this for myself all the time & I know what smoky flavor to expect. This was NOT that. He insists it's mezcal then tries to flip the situation on me:\nMe: this doesn't taste like mezcal, are you sure it's not vodka? I just want to make sure because I have an allergy to grains & I can't have most vodkas.\nBartender: It is mezcal, I just ran out of the other one I had that's why it tastes different. I guess I could remake it if you really want me to but I'm busy right now.\nMother in law: please, we'd really rather not go to the ER tonight.\nBartender: you know Cointreau is a grain based spirit too, right?\nSir, you should've swapped that for simple syrup instead.\n\nThe next morning at 10:15, there were 5 small groups of people waiting to be seated for brunch (like 2-4 tops). Even those with reservations were told to wait 15 mins even though every table inside was empty & they stop brunch at 10:30. In 15 mins brunch would've been over. One couple behind us lost patience & just pushed their way through, grabbed a table without a reservation. \n\nFood is good but service is terrible. Literally go to any other restaurant within a 2-5 min drive / 10 min walk.",

There was a line of about ten people, but no one showed up for over 5 minutes. Turns out our, our other friend had gotten there early so we found him and sat down.  We waited another ten minutes (he had gotten their ten minutes before us), and no one came by our table to offer water or a menu. To be fair, we weren't having a uniquely bad experience. No one was receiving service. I went to the bar to get menus. Even there I couldn't get anyone's attention after another 5 minutes. We eventually decided to leave.  I get that restaurants are understaffed, but at a certain point it just makes sense to shut down for the day.",

                "text": "A friend and I visited The Betty for a belated Mother's Day celebration.  We are local to Atlanta, parked down the street and walked the few blocks to the Kimpton to check it out.\n\nMy friend told me about the rooftop bar so we planned for drinks before dinner.  The rooftop bar, St. Julep, was a neat place. We took the elevator to the roof and landed in a hip and trendy spot for drinks.  I went to the bar toward the end of the roof and waited in line to order.  There was one bartender and two barbacks.  I waited what seemed like a while to order.  I ordered two drinks, one frozen and one cute and pink.  The frozen drink 'needed to come from inside' so I had to wait for that to be brought over from the other bar.  I paid and sat with my friend. The drinks were nice, the frozen one was way better then my Gin drink and twice the size for the same price. \n\nWe made our way to The Betty and sat. We ordered our appetizers and entrees, we were hungry!  My friend ordered the Broiled Half Lobster and I ordered the 'Wedge' Salad'.  The food arrived and the lobster looked divine. The wedge left a lot to be desired.  Not the wedge I had in mind.  It was more like a few leaves of lettuce piled with seeds and herbs.  I was very disappointed.  You can't call it a wedge if it's not a wedge.  \n\nAfter the salad left me hungry, the entrees finally came.  The lasagna I ordered was again, not what I expected.  It looked like a cinnamon roll but with cheese and mushroom. I was not into it at all.  I expected sauce and cheese and a bigger portion.  I left dinner hungry for sure.  \n\nWe went to pay and we had a Kimpton gift card.  Nobody knew how to run the payment.  The server took our cellphone Aline the restaurant to show her manager.  I felt uncomfortable my phone was taken away for so long.  Why didn't they know how to process this?  Finally, over 20 minutes later we were paid and ready to leave. \n\nI will not come back to The Betty, ever.  Food was not worth it and the bar drinks were overpriced for what they were.",

Followed by two orders of linguine with clams (and a few Calabrian chili pieces for kick). Added on a cauliflower cheese thing and Brussels sprouts with grapes side. Plenty of food for two - ended up with a lot to go! Oh - and some sorbet for dessert. Stephanie was attentive and knowledgeable.",

The environment has a more classic, dim-lit, sophisticated vibe, and there seemed to be some mixed reviews about the atmosphere being a bit pretentious. However, I thought it was nice and cozy. We did have to eat from their prix fixe menu in the event of valentine's, which we didn't mind so much. It was $110 per person with additional prices depending on what we order. We both ordered the Beef Wellington for our main (additional $45/per person), and we both got the oyster rockefeller and lobster thermidor to start off our meal. The apps were great, both quite salty, but flavorful. As for our main entree, beef wellington, the tenderloin was so smooth and tender, cooked about medium rare-rare. As for the service, we thought all staff were very friendly and attentive -- especially, the manager lady (?) would catch what we needed even before we asked and was thorough during her service. Anyways, all in all, food is on the saltier side but flavors were good and so was the service! Would recommend for a date night spot!",

We ordered heirloom pumpkin soup, spaghetti, Cornish rock chicken, prime rib steak and short rib with most of the veggie plates excluding the potatoes. The veggies were delish. My favorite were the broccolini. Steamed and seasoned lightly but perfectly. The cauliflower had a spicy surprise to it but yummy. The chicken was good but a little fatty. The spaghetti was the smallest plate. The birthday boy ordered it and basically we had to go to McDonalds after. He did say it was delicious just not worth the price tag for such small amount. The short rib was so fatty that our waiter had to apologize for serving us fat and provided us with another plate. This time there was actual meat. Overall, not sure if I return to this place.",

                "text": "Honestly, The Betty completely met expectations. My only qualm is that a place that expects at least a minimum of $100 a head charges you for extra bread haha but otherwise, this meal was spot on! It was only $4 for an extra order but at a place like this it felt slightly nickel and dime-y...but the bread was that good that I paid for more anyway!\n\nThe drinks were delicious and the Square Hammer was a favorite of mine as a whiskey lover. My wife had her taste of a few drinks and they were all great. \n\nWe started with the oysters and lobster tail and let me tell you, the butter sauce on the lobster was fantastic! From there we went with the scallops, lasagna, and cauliflower; all delicious in their own right. The cauliflower with a fiery Asian flavor, the scallops deliciously accompanied by saffron, and a lasagna that had an unforgettable cheese. Our waiter, Eddie, advised us that this sounded like the \"perfect\" amount and it really was. One more dish may have been just a bit much. Topped off with espressos and the peach Bavarian for dessert, I am laying on the couch a happy camper after this meal! We will definitely be back to visit!",

Well done to him. \n\nThe 1-star deduction was because of the service. We were underwhelmed by the service provided by our server. The drinks were okay. I shouldn't have to chase down our server when paying a $400 tab. \n\nAmbiance was nice. I would most likely return for the fish, but not sure if I would recommend versus other $$$$ restaurants.",

I had the lasagna and it was just bland and not well dimensioned flavor-wise, really like it came from a frozened bag. The scallops seem to be a bit more tasty though, the portion sizes were a little small, as scallops tend to be, so no big deal there. \n\nWe also had the sorbet for dessert which was fine, it's pretty hard to mess up two scoops of strawberry sorbet. I had a glass of Prosecco and my guest had the Daiquiri cocktail which were both fine and again very hard to mess up. \n\nI may have picked the \"wrong dish\" from the menu because I was really hoping to have something flavorful and unique to dine on. I will return to the Betty to try one more dish from the menu, but was not at all happy that my first time was a bit of a miss. Here's hoping for better next time.",

So too was the good amount of space between each table of diners. We were excited to try the supper club-themed restaurant after seeing several reviews, and were not disappointed. The menu is interesting, the plating is pretty perfection, and the bread service is worth the visit alone. Think King + Duke's popovers, but lighter and cheesier. The menu had 4 appetizers, 4 pastas, a raw bar menu, several entrees and some higher end sharing entrees. Hands down the best dish? The cauliflower side... with a Parmesan aioli, chili and pine nuts, large enough for 2 to share, small enough to enjoy all to yourself with a lighter entree. We were dismayed to find the much applauded Shrimp Cocktail wasn't on the menu that night, but everything else made up for it. Honorable mention for the Poached Halibut and great wine pairing suggestions. Top marks, Kimpton.",

It feels like you're legit walking into a movie and everyone is pretending to be pretentious in order to convince us that it's fancy LOL. \n\nWe didn't know everything was taps until we were about to order. While the food was good, the prices didn't reflect taps prices so that was a little strange! \n\nIt's definitely work trying out, but after staying at the Kimpton for a weekend, this was not our favorite spot in the hotel.",

His knowledge of the menu, professionalism, and superb recommendations (mezcal Negroni, for example)  convinced us this is now one of our favorite restaurants & will be back very soon. :) \n\nThe food and drinks were phenomenal. The best dining experience in years. Reminded us of 2019 days.\n- hamachi crudo is a must \n- snap pea salad is a perfect, light starter with a lot of flavor\n- ricotta gnocchi.. order it.. you won't regret it \n- NY strip had an amazing reduction; great cut of meat (the butcher is also the owner of the farm where it is sourced)\n- lemon cheesecake is just as good as all the reviews say",
