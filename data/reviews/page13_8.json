        "text": "Honestly, this is tied with Sushi Hayakawa as my favorite sushi restaurant ever, but I think Umi is less intimidating and pretentious. I'd also like to add that the service was 100x better than Oku's and the experience was overall much more enjoyable.\n\nI came here with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday on a Saturday night. We started with cocktails, the spicy tuna crispy rice appetizer, assorted sashimi, and 2 sousaku nigiris (the sake and otoro). My favorite thing is always sashimi, but I gotta say, the sousaku nigiris were mind blowing. The sake aioli nigiri might take the cake for best rendition of raw fish I've ever eaten. The tuna crispy rice was a tasty start to our main meal as well and provided a bit more substance.\n\nAs for rolls, we ended up ordering the Kamikaze, New Page, and Hurricane. They were all tasty (we demolished them all) but IMO, rolls always go overshadowed by sashimi and nigiri, as was the case for me here. But alas, if I filled myself up on sashimi only, I'm afraid my bill would be about $500 more than it was. We also got dessert which was also delicious but I honestly don't remember what it was. They do make one dessert that they only make 12 or so of per night, which we missed out on. Next time!\n\nMy suggestion would be to sample a little bit of everything - I am tempted to try the Omakase the next time I come to Umi (which will be very soon!)",

        "text": "Chef Todd is BACK!!!! At Umi!!!!\n\nI was dedicated to Doraku back in the day when Chef Todd was there. It's been a while since I've been back to Umi, but knowing Chef Todd was there--I had to go back. \n\nWe ordered the modern omakase experience, and it was phenomenal. I had both the lychee and cucumber martini and can't say which one was better. DO ask for them to do it without the simple syrup because it's so much better.\n\nWe had tuna tartare, lobster, red snapper carpaccio, seared scallops, duck, assortment of nigiri and sashimi (sashimi not pictured but there was scallop, sweet shrimp, EVERYTHING), avocado salad--so incredible. We also ordered the o-toro box and rainbow row in addition to our omakase. I want to go back so badly!\n\nI am full blown all about Umi now. Knowing Chef Todd is there--I'll be back!",

        "text": "Great COVID protocols. Their approach is so unique as they've used an art installation to place mannequins with animal masks throughout the space to keep people separated from one another. It's a great conversation starter and kept us thoroughly entertained all dinner. There is also hand sanitizer all throughout the space.\n\nService is an A+ for sure. Very knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. \n\nWe were a bit nervous that we would not be able to finish our meal as we were warned we were capped at 1.5 hours to eat, but our hot entree took a while to arrive. We should not have worried, though, as we were never rushed and even had time to enjoy a pot of coffee after our meal.\n\nEverything was delicious. We had the tuna tataki, rock shrimp tempura, spicy tuna crispy rice, hamachi caviar, hurricane roll, and the chicken teriyaki with rice and veggies. \n\nThe hamachi caviar was unreal with the dijon mustard drizzle. We also loved how fresh everything was with the chicken teriyaki and that the chunks of veggies were large and crunchy.\n\nA great meal, but will save for very special occasions as it is pricey!",

We went for a late dinner, around 9:30, and the site was still packed.\n\nThe decor is dark color and wood and is low lights, really helpful and chill, however, as is a small place with all the people, the noise level was higher than what I expected(yes, I just sounded like a grumpy person).\n\nThe food, well the fame comes before this place, and it was delicious! We had several small plates to share, my favorite the rock shrimp, we order them half creamy spicy and half ponzu sauce. Also, we ordered the avocado with wasabi dressing; to my surprise, it was terrific.\n\nOverall the place was charming, food delicious,  the service outstanding.

Masks are required. \n\nThe overall vibe of this place is dark/candlelight with a lounge feel. Music is playing in the background. To adjust for the covid environment, they have mannequins dressed very nicely with masks. These are used to create social distance. Although, creepy at first as I thought it was some odd masked party going on, once I realized what was actually happening, I thought it was pretty creative. We sat at the bar and the mannequins made it feels as though the full bar was pretty private. \n\nThe sushi was amazing here! We ordered a bunch of nigiri and most of it was already cured. It was pricy, but worth every penny. I wanted to immediately go back the next day. Service was good for a busy night. We lost track of our waiter when it came time to check out but other than that he was pretty attentive. Umi Atlanta, I am a fan.",

Have been wanting the sushi bar but have either not been able to book far enough in advance in Ooentable or they cannot book the sushi bar from Opentable (have never seen it available). You can only have the Ito-Kase from the sushi but tried the next tier down, the Miyabi omakase. Was less of a traditional sushi omakase and more of a coursed tasting menu. Delicious nevertheless. \n\nThis omakase comes with A LOT of food. Almost couldn't finish, courses just kept coming out. Highlights were cooked fish dish (miso black cod), the nigiri (all delicious - wagyu was solid), and the two starters - yellowtail jalapeño and the tuna carpaccio. \n\nNon-omakase the avocado salad is delicious - very unique as well as the agedashi tofu.\n\nDefinitely need to visit for a great Japanese food experience.",

        "text": "Umi is always a great option for sushi and cool vibes in Atlanta. It's one of my personal faves. I love bringing friends here from out of town, they always really enjoy. The atmosphere is energetic and contemporary. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the seared diver scallops. They're listed under the hot plates on the menu and absolutely delicious. I also really like the lobster toban-yaki. The yellowtail jalapeño is a great starter. Those are two of my \"go-to's\". My most recent time going to Umi I tried the lobster tempura rolls. They were okay but will definitely be sticking to the aforementioned dishes.\n\nMy only advice is to book a reservation in advance if you KNOW you want to come here. Yelp doesn't do reservations at Umi (at least not as far as I know)- but Open Table does. I try to go during the week because this place can get overwhelmingly BUSY on weekends! Also for reservations with open table, a credit card is required for reservations on the weekend- hence another reason I'm fine with going during the week.",

        "text": "Umi was one of the best sushi experiences I've ever had. \n \nThe restaurant is quite chic, a perfect place for date night or a special occasion. My mom and I easily spent two hours here, enjoying deep conversation and great food. I must say though that it is really dark in the restaurant - many of the customers were using their phones to see the menu. Alas, no pretty pictures of the food to commemorate the evening!\n \nWe ordered the Miyabi omakase menu, and it was phenomenal. The offerings were yellowtail jalapeno and another starter fish, tuna carpaccio with an avocado soy vinaigrette, an assortment of sashimi (including buttery uni and delicate scallops), fried rockfish tempura with shiitake mushrooms, black cod misoyaki, Chilean sea bass, an assortment of nigiri sashimi and a green tea dessert.\n \nEach dish was absolutely delightful. The balance of textures and flavors were spot on, and all the fish was so fresh. The most memorable bites were:\n- Salmon sashimi: the best salmon I have ever tasted and just melted in my mouth. \n- Rock shrimp tempura: the spicy sauce on this was bomb with a light and crispy batter on the tempura. The shiitake mushrooms were full of umami flavor.\n- Black cod and Chilean sea bass: both of these had flavors that were out of this world that I closed my eyes with each bite. The fish was so tender and delicate with scrumptious miso and yu-an sauces. The smoke on it was fantastic as well.\n- kobe-beef nigiri: that seer on the kobe was perfect and the meat was so tender and fatty.\n \nService was impeccable and personable. The wine offerings are also great.\n \nTen stars! I will make sure to come back the next time I am in Atlanta!",

        "text": "I had my first omakase experience here at Umi and it was the best thing ever. My boyfriend made a reservation for Miyabi omakase (2nd level of the 3; I believe $140/per person) for my birthday and we both agreed it was well worth the cost. We sat at the sushi bar, which is what I highly recommend for those who do omakase. The head sushi chef was friendly and humorous. \n\nEverything we had were delicious. The fish tasted fresh and not too fishy, and the hot foods from the kitchen gave a good balance between the sushi entrees. This was the order of our course: yellowtail  jalapeño and tuna carpaccio, rock shrimp tempura and some other kind of tempura, sashimi, Chilean sea bass and black cod misoyaki, nigiri, and vanilla panna cotta with guava jelly and topped with a coconut crisp. So, so good.\n\nSince Umi, I had omakase at one other place and was highly disappointed. It looks like this is the place to go for omakase! I definitely want to go back to try other things on the menu. \n\nValet parking is free but make sure to cash tip! No mandatory dress code but most people are in business casual attire.",

The sushi is okay, but the hype must be for people who've never had fresh sushi! Better off going to Buford Highway and enjoying a nice meal there.

        "text": "Truly abysmal customer service. We had a reservation for a party of 8. A few of us were flying in and coming straight to the restaurant. My friends flight was delayed so she was going to  arrive late. I explained the situation and asked if we could be seated and start ordering, however they stated the entire party needed to be present and they would do a \"head count\" prior to seating us. I understand the reason behind this policy but we don't need to be treated like kindergarteners. We were waiting at the very cramped bar and My husband joined us after closing our tab at the bar next door. He was wearing sandals (again because we had just flown in). We were told he would not be allowed in according to their dress code. I explained that we were traveling from out of town and so didn't have time to change and honestly the idea of a strict dress code at a decent but my no means Michelin starred restaurant seems antiquated and frankly absurdly self important. I told them that that was fine and they could cancel the reservation and we would dine at a more inclusive establishment. The manager said that because they were losing a table of 8 they would still be charging the $50 pp reservation cancellation fee to my credit card. I told him I would dispute the charge with the credit card company since we did not cancel and were in actuality denied service and he stated that he would make sure I was no longer welcome at their restaurant. We left and had dinner at King and Duke down the street. They had no issue with my husband's attire. Of note, as we were leaving I saw people entering the restaurant in casual sneakers, and even one woman exiting in yoga pants, a gym shirt and gym shoes. Unclear to me why this is ok and yet we were denied service because of a pair of sandals. I will not be returning to this restaurant again. One would think modern consumer and hospitality dependent  businesses would recognize that dogmatic adherence to outdated standards of dress/appearance is arbitrary and ignorant.",

        "text": "I came here for the second time and sat at a table and tried the Miyabi omakase this time. Only downside this visit was that we had to wait about 10 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. I understand because this restaurant is super busy on Friday nights. But it was still kind of bummer, especially considering our service for the rest of the night was on the slower side.\n\nMy first visit, we sat at the sushi bar and I would absolutely recommend the sushi bar over a table for a better experience. The dining area is much louder and you get a more personal experience and faster service at the sushi bar. For the drink I got a Moscow Mule and it's a basic but good! There are 3 tiers of Omakase here. I tried the Umi (currently $100) last time and tried the 2nd tier Miyabi (currently $145) this time. I liked the selections for the Miyabi more. But there isn't too much of a difference in the quantity of food. \n\nFor the Miyabi, I got\n-Tuna Tartare: Amazing, really beautiful presentation. I love the sweetness of the fruit pieces in there. It complements it really well. The quail egg was a really wonderful touch. It comes in half a shell and they recommend you pour it on and mix everything up.\n-Spicy Rock Shrimp: Really good but I was expecting more. But still really wonderful, creamy, and has a kick.\n-Sashimi Plate: I loved all the selections. Salmon and toro are my favorites. The hamachi was wonderful as well. You really have to LOVE raw fish to finish this as it is a lot! Only one I didn't finish was the firefly squid. I personally wasn't a fan.\n-Sea bass: So tender and flavorful. The decor was on fire as well so that was a nice touch. \n-Nigiri Plate: I really, really liked this nigiri selection more than the Umi nigiri selection. 3 of them had caviar on top. My favorite is the sake (salmon) with aioli and caviar. Like I would do a lot of things to eat more of that. It was amazing and I'm still thinking about it. I enjoyed all of them. Probably liked the one with the shiso leaf the least. \n-Lemon Pannacotta: I actually liked this one more than the black sesame pannacotta from last time. As it was tart and sweet at the same time. Bf preferred the black sesame one. This one had a smaller gold flake than last time. I love the gold flake as it gives it a nice presentation and looks wonderful! \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the selections for Miyabi more than the Umi. However, I preferred the bar experience more than the table. I liked talking to the chef and seeing them prepare it. I also felt like service was much quicker as at the sushi bar, we were given the next course as soon as we finished. At the table, we had to wait a bit between courses. Umi closes at 11:30, but we weren't served our final course or finished until 12 am. There were still some others left inside until that time as well. We are super quick eaters so we were trying to eat fast to compensate for the wait times between courses. We didn't want to keep anyone there after their closing time! \n\nThe wait times were a bummer, but we were always kept updated on the status of the courses so I felt the service was pretty friendly and communicative. Food is amazing as always. Many sushi places are actually not Japanese-owned, and this place you can tell is Japanese owned and they take quality seriously. Probably my favorite sushi place in Atlanta. \n\nAlso: parking is valet near Chops Lobster Bar! Across from Whole Foods. Walk up the stairs and take a left. Umi is the wooden door. Love the interior. Dim lighting. Sushi bar is more lit for better quality photos. I'm glad I got a new phone that has a better night setting for my pictures at the table!",

However the experience has been greatly impacted by the current state of thing. \n\nTypically the service and atmosphere is impeccable. You ask for something and it's there immediately. The ambiance is comfortable and sleek. Not so much this time. \n\nFirst of all I don't know what was wrong with the air conditioner but it was not working at all. I was sweating through my clothes. My the end of the night my stomach ached from being overheated while trying to eat. The woman at the table next to us was literally fanning herself. And on top of that it was hard to get the waiter's attention. I never had silverware when I needed it and my water glass was empty repeatedly. I had to ask for the check several times before it was brought and they did not validate parking. \n\nOverall it was a very disappointing birthday. I am hopeful that it was a unique experience and that should I return it will be back to it's usually impeccable standards. Fingers crossed.",

Mostly chef selections and I don't even remember how many selections ... sashimi and sushi flying everywhere until we almost had to be carted off! \n\nTHE BEAT SUSHI/SASHIMI I HAVE EVER HAD to date! Super fresh super delicious!!! I did a review on orient express Vinings( also delicious) but not nearly as amazing as this place! Maybe it had a lot to do with the experience also I don't know but it left me speechless! The uni was slightly sweet, and super buttery, we had several selections of sashimi and each was SUPER FRESH AND AMAZINGLY DEVINE! From hamachi, to salmon, to toro oh my! The negiri was portioned just right! Great fish to rice ratio and no sauce necessary! \n\nWe had several appetizers one avocado salad, one chef special (dot recall the name) both delicious  we had a chef special roll... he caught that bad boy on fire! Lit it up! Do t remember the name of that either but MAN it make you want to slap the person next to you! \n\nThe chef was funny, knowledgeable, entertaining and just all around joy and pleasure to be in the company of! He kept saying try this... I think he loved that we were open to try anything! I loved it! Best experience ever! \n\nIf you ever get the opportunity to visit this place please don't hesitate! I the sushi is fresh! I mean FRESH! The chefs all of them know what they are doing!  Everyone was very nice and Accommodating! \n\nThe restrictions put ask? SPOTLESS! The toilet does tricks and lights up! Seriously! It is a bit crouched in the main dining area... I say eat at the bar it is a better experience and you might even get a little treat\n  \n\nNow the prices.... well this ain't your bargain budget sushi... be prepared to leave with your purse or wallet significantly lighter but it will be worth it! You will realize and come to know that what you paid for was quality. And you can put a price on that",

The food was delicious. Would highly recommend trying out their speciality nigiris especially the wagyu and salmon ones. The meat truly melts in your mouth. The lobster box roll and kamakaze rolls were also delicious but nothing incredibly special. We ordered several dishes and my best friends even sent a bottle of wine for us to enjoy on my birthday. However, I found it strange that there was nothing from the restaurant. Other restaurants we have visited have done an incredible job making these special occasions feel special and I will say Umi lacks in this area. Considering how hard it can be to get a reservation I want to say that I expected just a little bit more. Agedashi tofu was just okay - breading became soggy and to be honest the dish didn't have much flavor.",

        "text": "Decent sushi spot, friendly host and better waiter! We were seated right by the bar which you wouldn't think be packed on a Tuesday night but it was.....if I turned my head left, there was a girls butt right in my face and the same if I turned right but it was a guys butt. People were literally standing around me as my gf sat on the other end which was by the window so no one was able to around her but very noisy and umcomfortable.....I'm sure eating in the dining hall would be a better experience but we rolled with it because it was slammed and you really needed a reservation....even on a Tuesday night\n\nAs far as the food, the sashimi was decent...not the worse but the yellowtail and otoro tuna was pretty good. We got the wagyu beef roll.....save yourself $25....not worth it. The sea bass was good but wasn't anything too special....texture was not what I'm accustomed to and the flavor was just ok...We Lyfted over so not sure about the parking and was alittle difficult to find because it is tucked away inside a shopping block and the front door does not look like a main entrance but the decor was nice and pretty poppin",

        "text": "Before entering the restaurant, my impressions of the restaurant was that it would have a more intimate atmosphere. Instead when I arrived, it seemed more like a bar with a restaurant attached considering how loud it was and how close all the tables were.\nMy reservation was at 8 pm, ended up arriving at 815 and was told to wait for awhile. We waited about 10 minutes before we were seated in the corner near the kitchen entrance. This spot was surprisingly quiet compared to the rest of the restaurant.\n\nMain courses\nSashimi tasting - albacore was surprisingly tasty and beat out all the other flavors on the platter\nOtoro sashimi - fatty and melts in your mouth\nUni nigiri - one of the freshest best tasting uni I've ever had\nSeared diver scallops - brought out still being cooked and waited an additional 2 minutes before they were ready. Quite a few pieces of scallops covered in radish soaked in Miso sauce. Juicy in the inside with a thin crisp outer layer. Loved it!\n\nReserved the chocolate Kyu in advance since they only make 12 a night. \nChocolate Kyu - chocolate circle with mascarpone whiskey cream, green tea sponge cake and fresh fruits. Slight hint of the whiskey flavor . Chocolate and fruits were sweet. Mascarpone cream very airy and paired well with everything. There was also a green tea spread at the bottom of the chocolate kyu that went well with the chocolate. \nGreen tea tiramisu - tiramisu wrapped in a dough almost like a mochi. Tiramisu was not too sweet. Edible gold flakes with chocolate pieces and green tea semifreddo was sooo good. I really wish they had more pieces of the semifreddo, could have eaten that all night.\nGreen tea souffle - sweetest dessert and best for last. Strong green tea flavor. 25 min wait for it.\n\nThe chocolate kyu and green tea tiramisu were the most unique desserts I've had in recent memory and definitely worth a taste.\n\nWater service here is amazing. They were very diligent at constantly refilling the waters. Food came out slow considering how most of it was just cold. 5 star quality food, but the hostess service was poor so -1 star for making us wait and almost convincing us to wait even longer at a nearby bar?",

        "text": "Umi has been my go to spot for celebrations, whether it's birthdays, anniversaries, or Valentine's day.  Their food still amazes me every time though I wish they update their menu time to time.  I don't believe their menu has changed in the past 3 years unless they were subtle changes.\n\nUmi is located across the buckhead whole foods within the St.Regis plaza.  You valet in front of Chops and take the elevator up to 2nd floor and walk across the grass lawn to a small nook restaurant.\n\nUpon entering you'll see the bar/lounge area on the right, usually with fancy smancy business men and couples enjoying cocktails before their meal.  Straight ahead, your host(ess) will help seat you and right behind the hostess stand are the bathrooms.  Bathrooms are super clean and luxed out with expensive soap, nice hand paper towels that are umi logo stamped, and inviting toilet seats that are heated to warm up your toosh in this cold weather.\n\nLighting is very dim inside with super cool light fixtures that set the ambiance.  Though very romantic, its hard to take good pics of the food or see the menu, for what is worth.  Can't help seeing people using their phone light to look at the menu or see certain bursts of flash going off taking pics.  Best place to take good pics are the front tables where some lighting is available.  \n\nNow on to the best part, the food.\nMy usual orders and favorites are:\n- avocado salad: comes with tangy horseradish vinaigrette that is super refreshing and addicting\n- uni with quail eggs: fresh uni with quail egg goes hand in hand like PB&Jelly!  So smooth and delicious!\n- miso cod: Super soft, moist, and flavorful fish.  Garnished with an interesting pickled veggie.  So good!\n- lobster tobanyaki: server will put the lobsters on a hot stone grill and pour delicious sauce over it.  You'll see the lobsters sizzle in front of your eyes and eat it hot. Super good!!!\n- otoro with truffle oil: smooth, fresh fish with powerful truffle oil that is heavenly.  \n- sweet shrimp:  Nigiri comes with fried shrimp heads that you can munch on on the side.  Crunchy and rich in flavor.  The nigiri is seriously buttery good!!!\n\nAnd my must dessert is the green tea souffle! Haven't tried any other desserts here but hav no desire to.  This is my ultimate favorite! Dish comes out pipping hot and server will drizzle hot matcha sauce over it.  Its super soft, fluffy, moist, and matcha-ery.  Make sure to order early since its limited and takes 30 minutes to make.  \n\nEverything is splendid, including the service, which is top notch.  Seriously they have so many staff members to cater to you for every little thing but I guess you definitely pay for it.  Umi definitely isn't so friendly on your wallet being $$$$. \n\nWhile Umi is one of my favorite upscale sushi places in atlanta and lacks any flaws, still wish they would take the rising sun flag down...",

Starting from the moscato our server, John, recommended to the dessert; everything was perfect. \n\nThe avocado salad was my personal favorite. It was simple, but tasty. I could not stop picking at it. You must also try this lobster dish they have where it's already cooked, but they bring a small grill to your table to allow you to grill it a bit more to give it a more crisp bite. \n\nDon't forget to order dessert! \nI tried their parfait & I was so sad they do not allow to-go orders because I wanted 2 more! It was the best way to end our dinner & cleanse my palette. But I really, REALLY wanted more.",

This place is always packed so make sure to have a reservation before you show up. Make it at least a couple of days ahead of you intend to choose your time. There are normally spaces same that but you will have to adjust at there timing. Last reservation happens at 9:30 but I don't recommend it. All food is fresh so by las call many dishes are gone.  \nThey have a great sake selection. Sake pairs outstandingly well with raw fish so it's a must. Good news is that sales are not so expensive so you can get a decent bottle for 80 USD. It's a fantastic high-end restaurant so dress up and be prepared to pay $150 pp.",

        "text": "This is by far the best sushi experience ever. But to pigeon hole it to just sushi is an understatement. The dishes are so imaginative and exquisite that they will push your boundaries. For example I hate onions. One item pictured is yellowtail with shaved onion. INCREDIBLE. Another mind blown experience is the avocado salad. If you're like me, you may think it would be ridiculous to waste stomach space at a fine eatery as this but I was wrong. The flavors of the juice, consistency of the avocado, and the crunch of the onion slices provide a reaction far too enjoyable for me to describe. To top it off, we ordered the lobster tower (not proper name). Phenomenal. This restaurant transcends the mere sushi bar. We will be back often. Thank you to the Umi team! \n\nPS Umi stands for ocean if you're wondering.",

The place was packed but we got lucky with a spot by the sushi bar, with the condition that we have to leave by 8:30 and we finished dessert 4 minutes before 8:30 . Best seats in the house with good lighting for photos, the rest of the restaurant has pretty dim light. It was wonderful able to see the sushi chef working. Our server is very attentive and explained things well. The food is delicious, especially the lobster toban-yaki. The chocolate dome dessert is limited per night and luckily we got one of the last 2 of the night. Would love to come out again soon.",

Upon entering, the place looked so packed, but then I realized they had placed mannequins at every other table in order to properly social distance! This was nice because it made the restaurant feel as packed as it normally would be before the global pandemic. \n\nMy sisters and I love lychee martinis and we were sad that they were not on the drink menu. We asked the waiter if it was possible to order one and he said of course! I really appreciated that and he was super nice about it. \n\nThe food was really good and fresh. The crispy rice appetizer and shishito peppers were delicious. I also ordered the salmon sashimi and a tuna roll. The sashimi was SO fresh. The tuna roll was good, but tiny. I am someone who cannot finish a roll by myself and I was left with my stomach growling after dinner. I was considering giving three stars because the portions are small and the food is ridiculously expensive. For the drink and food I mentioned above, I paid over $100 for myself. The food is very good and fresh though so if money isn't a concern, go for it. The service was great so that bumped the rating up to 4 stars!",

They have come up with a fun whimsical way to enforce social distancing.... with beautiful statues donned with interesting headgear having dinner next to ya.\nTo give ya an idea of how succulent the food was... my 2 year old son & I came here for dinner two nights out of the four we were here for vacation. My favorite sushi items were the specialty sushi like sake aioli and yellowtail/otoro caviar. If you can't decide which to get, I recommend the otoro b/c it just melts in your mouth! The aburi sushi were good, but I have had better at other Japanese restaurants.\nThe wagyu beef was absolutely divine!! It's pretty pricey at $33/oz (minimum 2 oz) but TOTALLY worth it! I think it was better than the Kobe beef I had in Kobe, Japan! \nThe Chilean sea bass was a little dry but great flavor. \nThe fluffy cheesecake was good but didn't like the banana glaze that it was soaked in.\nThis is my new favorite Japanese rest!!",

She suggested the most amazing dishes...everyone a visual and tasteful experience. \nHighly recommend the albacore sushi with truffle oil and the crispy rice with spicy tuna.

        "text": "This is my fourth time at Umi and it never fails to impress with each visit.\nI bought along my boyfriend (who had never ate here before) on a Friday night at 9:30PM. Reservations were a breeze through the OpenTable application, you will have to use your credit card due to the 24 hour cancellation fee. This is $60.00 per guest - so it's either you show up on time or you'll be charged.\n\nUmi is nearby Himitsu, Atlas and Chop's Lobster Bar. If you enter via valet at Chop's Lobster Bar / The Club at Chops - you will have to head up the stairs and into the courtyard. From there, you will see Umi's exterior: a crosshatching, wooden façade over glass and a wooden door with brass detailing.\n\nThe environment is loud, a lot like Katana (Sunset Boulevard) with subtle hints of Matsuhisa Beverly Hills and Nobu, like almost traveling to Los Angeles, Miami or Hong Kong without leaving Atlanta. Definitely not like a lot of the restaurants here in the Atlanta foodie scene. This is probably the closest restaurant that I have ate that's on par with what's served at Matsuhisa.\n\nUpon entering, we were greeted by two hosts at the front booth, who immediately knew our table # and apologised that it was still being cleaned. We figured this would happen since we were 10 minutes early. They recommended for us to order drinks while-we-wait at the extremely busy bar (left of hostess booth). Shortly after ordering a Moscow Mule (served generously with a large slice of ginger) and a Paloma, we were directed by an asian gentleman with glasses that our table was ready.\n\nEven at 9:30PM, the restaurant was still buzzing, couples and business partners were still being sat at tables. We didn't feel cramped due to a request that I made to be seated nearby the sushi bar. Our waiter, Paul was kind enough to remove some of the plates besides us since there were only two guests in our party.\n\nPaul was kind enough to walk through my SO through the menu, though we were there for one reason only: お任せ (which means \"leave it up to you\" aka chef selection). I ended up choosing the Miyabi Omakase for us. This is $120.00 per person.\n\nEach dish was paced evenly, one after the other - there was no long wait for dishes in between. We were happy with the fresh selection of nigiri, sashimi and hot dishes.\n+ The Black Cod Misoyaki was similar what I could make at home (less sweeter) but still enjoyable.\n+ Chilean Sea Bass Yu-an Yaki was subtle, sweet and flaky.\n+ The Kobe-Beef Nigiri, definitely one of my favourites every time I visit.\n+ Dessert: Chocolate Kyu (chocolate sphere with interactive mallet), Green Tea Soufflé, pressed Lamill coffee were sold out for the night. We ordered a matcha-infused cake / brownie? This was an extra dessert on top of the desserts that were included for the Miyabi Omakase, but was a wonderful surprise. I'm a little biased because I'm matcha crazy.\n\nBill total was $340.00 (tips included) so prepared to spend a little more for a fantastic, memorable dinner.\nService was wonderful and attentive. Waters were never low, alcoholic drinks were flowing, empty plates were never left on the table for too long. We couldn't ask for a better waiter than Paul. Please ask for Paul on your next visit!",
