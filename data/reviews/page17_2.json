        "text": "My go to burger place in Atlanta! Been there so many times and just now realizing they have several locations! Most recently we went, we got the  Grindhouse Style Burgers but this time also tried their dirty fries. Oh my goddddd. My mouth is watering writing this review two days later. I dont even like chili but their Brisket chili had me licking the bowl. It was spicy by itself too but loved it on the fries with all other toppings. We ordered takeout but ate on their patio. So they gave us the chili on the side, so the fries don't get soggy, which I do prefer. Can't believe I had never tried those fries before. Def will be getting those or at least the chili every time we go. Brisket chili. Wow. Just wow.",

        "text": "First off, there are some parking issues, their parking lot was full so we slowly navigated other cars looking for spots for a few minutes before street parking nearby. Not a big deal, but keep that in mind. Next up was the very unfriendly cash register operator, which was one of 2 people we encountered during our visit. She was clearly having a bad day (slamming cups down, unfriendly, unhappy), but definitely shouldn't have been on the registered as one of the only person guest interact with.\n\nOk with the negatives out of the way... let's get to the burgers, which matters most. We ordered a \"junior\" (single patty) hillbilly burger with pimento cheese, brisket chili and jalapenos... oh it was delicious. The fries were tasty and crispy. We also had an impossible burger (single patty) and to that I added pepper jack cheese and brisket chili. They chili is an amazing topping for these burgers, would recommend for sure. The impossible burger patty (available at many places nowadays) was almost indistinguishable from the standard beef burger... but with no meat! Incredible!\n\nThe sweet potato fries were probably a bit tastier than the normal fries, mostly because they were crispier, which is my preference. Overall, very tasty burgers, without being too greasy or messy. Interesting topping options and pre-selected burger options compared to basic burger spots.\n\nThe only other downside is that despite the large patio, dogs are only allowed outside the patio... aka 1-2 tables next to the parking lot, probably not a great place to bring your dog (thankfully we did not).",

It's got this cool dive bar in space aura with a big projector that is always showing cool films. There's a good bit of indoor and outdoor seating which is great on lazy summer nights. \n\nFood wise, Grindhouse is great. Start easy with the traditional Grindhouse style burger. The burgers are melt in your mouth good. The buns they use are soft and before you know it, it's done. The fries are traditional krinkle fries which they give a healthy portion of. Grindhouse has decent milkshakes but is one of the few places with boozy milkshakes which are also yum but very specific flavors so beware. \n\nOverall I love Grindhouse and it's one of the first places I recommend to anyone looking for a great burger in town especially with all the locations!",

The only concern was that the burger was just laid on top of 2 pieces lettuce. It was not a wrap at all. \n\nAs an FYI there's also an upcharge for the impossible burger.",

        "text": "It took several tries before I was able to get through and place an order for pick-up one Sunday. I'm not going to embarrass myself and say how many times I tried but I really wanted that Impossible burger! When I went to pick up my order I could see why it took sooo long. The place was packed and the line for ordering was long. Fortunately I was able to bypass it and checkout at the bar. The total was $16 and some change for my Junior Apache Impossible burger with cheesy poofs (what Southerner can resist fried pimiento cheese?!). Everything was really good. The impossible burger definitely lives up to the hype. As a meat eater I wouldn't have known this was plant-based meat if you hadn't told me. Not sure what trickery/voodoo they're doing in the kitchen but as long as it's safe I'm here for it. The cheesy poofs were just that, cheesy balls of fried pimiento cheese. Can't go wrong here. I found the sweet chili sauce it came with to be a little funky. Weird since I typically like sweet chili sauce. I ended up having them with the chipotle ranch sauce instead and it was delicious. I'd order the burger or poofs again without question. \n\nParking is tight to say the least. I lucked out and someone was pulling out as I got there but if you go during peak times you may be playing a game of parking lot musical chairs for a while waiting for someone to leave.\n\nDefinitely worth checking them out if you're looking for a good plant-based burger.",

        "text": "Grindhouse, you hamburgled my heart!\n\nStopped by for lunch one weekend. Parking is limited, so we parked on the street. Grindhouse is a counter service restaurant. The counter is right by the entrance. The restaurant is a decent size with plenty of seating indoor and heated and covered outdoor. Cool decor.\n\nIt was very busy when we arrived, and there was a short line at the counter. When it was our turn to order, the gentleman at the counter greeted us and was very patient with us as we asked questions and took some time ordering. We went with the following:\nFried Pickles $4.99\nImpossible Burger Dixie Style (double) $8.99\nTurkey Grindhouse Style (junior) $5.99\nCrinkle Cut Fries $2.50\nMai-Chete $8\n\nThe fried pickles were delivered to our table hot and crispy. It was so hot we actually had to wait a few minutes to eat it. Hubs got the Impossible Burger which is a plant-based meat substitute patty in Dixie Style: pimento cheese, fried green tomato, carolina cole slaw, and chipotle ranch. I took a bite of his burger and couldn't believe it was meatless. It had great texture and flavor. I ordered the Turkey burger, Grindhouse Style. It came with American cheese, grilled onions, lettuce, pickles, and grindhouse sauce. It was amazing! Probably the best turkey burger I've ever had. I ordered a junior, which is a single patty and it was plenty for me. The fries were good. I also had the Mai-Chete which consists of pineapple, lime, and guava mai tai, bali hai tiki gold rum, and tabasco. I am a wuss when it comes to alcoholic drinks, so it was strong for me, but I enjoyed all the flavors. The hubs also ordered a beer, but I don't remember the name of it.\n\nI'm glad I finally got to try GKB. It has been on my list for a long time, and it didn't disappoint! Can't wait to try other burger styles!",

        "text": "Grindhouse is on my short list of best burgers in Atlanta.  You can tell their beef is of high quality, and they offer a variety of alternative meats that are also great (have not tried the Impossible yet).  The french fries are excellent and I love that they offer a twice-fried extra crispy option...nothing worse than soggy fries!  The hot dogs are also very good, though note if you opt for the chili topping it has a decent kick to it.  Also excellent are the sweet potato chips; oddly the Piedmont location seems to offer them only as an appetizer.  The atmosphere is very cool (you'd be hard pressed to find a more diverse clientele in ATL), but if you're wanting carry out check out the app...it makes ordering really easy and you can customize your order any way you like.  If it's a nice day and you have time, eat on the generously-sized patio.  Overall, highly recommend Grindhouse for satisfying your burger cravings!",

        "text": "The first time I had a Grindhouse burger was at the airport. The consistent quality there encouraged me to head to their real location on Peachtree. I was very pleasantly surprised by the more expansive and creative menu and clean, open, garage-themed ambience. \n\nI order the veggie burger with all of the vegetables, ketchup, and diablo (dark-colored smoky homemade hot) sauce. There is a large list of free veggie add-ons. Next time I will order the burger more well-done so maybe it won't be quite as soft, but the flavor is great. All of the burgers come on a soft, buttery classic bun that isn't too thick and compliments the burger well. It collapses some when it's wrapped up to go, but the prettiest burgers aren't usually the tastiest anyway. Their sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. They are not sweet at all. They ARE crispy! Crispy is a feat when it comes to sweet potato fries! Mmm. \n\nThey also have a full bar, local beer on draft and in cans, and a nice list of boozy milkshakes that I didn't try but all sound AMAZING. I want to go back and dine-in... desserting with one of their creations. Their prices are reasonable and food delicious.",

When I got to Grindhouse, I lucked out and got a parking spot right next to the entrance. My friends were not so lucky. Grindhouse has limited parking and it's kind of tight and hard to navigate. Depending on how busy they are, be prepared to park a few blocks down or along the residential street that runs up to the restaurant. \n\nThere will definitely be a line during lunchtime. My friend honestly just ordered her meal online for pickup instead of waiting in the long line! \n\nI tried the Yankee cheese burger with sweet potato fries and it was a decent meal. Not going to lie, I wasn't as blown away by the burger as I was hoping to be... don't kill me hardcore Grindhouse fans, but I liked my Culver's burger better than this one. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't necessarily anything special or memorable. \n\nThe sweet potato fries were pretty good. Nice and crispy and seasoned well. \n\nThe service here was pretty good considering how busy they were during the lunch rush. A server/host was assigned to the outside patio area where we were seated and did an great job running around getting everyone condiments, silverware, and anything else we tracked him down for.",

We got a double Grindhouse burger and a junior (1patty) hillbilly burger, both cooked medium. The Grindhouse burger had caramelized onions and a homemade sauce. The hillbilly had some freaking awesome chili and jalapeños! My main complaint would be that the burgers were over cooked. The fries were seasoned with some sort of Cajun tasting seasoning. All together, it was a great experience!\n\nPlus the outside is pet friendly. We love a pet and vegan friendly location.",

They have good selections at the bar and even boozy shakes assuming you aren't stuffed after your meal lol. This is easily the juiciest burger I've ever had it was so delicious. The diablo sauce had a nice pepper kick to it to complement the burger. I'm not the biggest fan of crinkle cut fries but these were legit. They give you plenty of cheese and bacon and the fries are perfectly seasoned as well. The service is great and the food didn't take long at all surprisingly since they had a pretty good crowd. The price you pay is easily worth it for the great quality you get. Was gonna get a shake but I was completely stuffed. Next time I'm in Atlanta I'm definitely getting one.",

Now I have always liked the veggie burgers at Grindhouse, but the boy LOVES the Impossible Burger, so there is that.  I get mine with green chiles, sometimes avocado...sometimes grilled onions.   \n\nThe side of slaw is pretty good.  Wife does the onion rings and they are one of the better rings out there, not greasy.  Fries are always good.\n\nWish they had more dark beers, but it is what it is.  Service has always been spot on.  Parking here is hit or miss...hopefully not literally.  ProTip, turn into the drive way parking area to the side, not the one off the side street.  The one off the side street has no way out and you have to turn the car around.  The other one, you can go behind the building and that puts you into the other parking area.  Worst case, park on the street.",

        "text": "Yay another delicious burger spot that you can't miss if you are in Atlanta. I came with my family on a Wednesday night, and it took us a while to find parking. There were some parking spots around the restaurant, but the spaces were very limited. You could try street parking in the back of the restaurant in the neighborhood though. \n\nThis is like the fancier version of In-N-Out. You order your food at the counter, get a number, and wait for the food to be delivered to your table. \n\nI ordered two make your own burgers with my own choice of meat and cheese. The meat was really tender and juicy. You could also customize your toppings as well, and some of the toppings might cost you a little extra. The burgers were both very delicious! I also got a side of the Onion rings, and a coffee milkshake. The onion rings tasted really plain to me and it didn't have that crispy texture, while the coffee milkshake was way too sweet...\n\nOverall, a great place if you want to have some delicious burgers! Maybe I'll try some of the beer selection they have, and order a side of fries instead of onion rings next time.",

Picked up a side of fries and a chocolate shake as well, because (duh) hot day in the park.\n\nThey have dog bowls on the patio (not the enclosed/covered part, but there are tables there that have large umbrellas over them.  I was a bit annoyed to be separated out like that, but it was comfortable enough and the food came quickly enough that I was happy.

I ended up not even getting the $5 Burger as the menu offered such a great variety of items. I ordered the Beef burger well done, Double with Swiss add Bacon. O. M. G. The burger was SUPERB. Perfectly cooked. Perfectly seasoned. Grilled potato bun. Ahhhhhhhh. I am having flashbacks. LoL! The crinkle fries were perfectly made with the right amount of seasoning salt. \n\nThis was an amazing experience and the food is well worth the prices they charge. \n\nThe service is great as well.",

Sunday afternoon we wanted to stop here after seeing this establishment on Atlanta eats. \n\nThe parking situation can be a little sticky. They only have room for a few cars. The car wash next door allows Grindhouse patrons to park there after 5 pm. You can also park on the neighborhood street that's next to Grindhouse. Please be careful not to block the neighbors driveways or mailboxes. We witness the tow service get two cars while eating! \n\nOrder from the menu upon entering,  take your number and find a seat. Decent crowd but service was pleasantly quick and attentive. It was a beautiful day so the patio was nice. The motley crew of other customers was definitely entertaining. The food wasn't spectacular but decent. I Opted for the cowboy style J.R. burger with chili cheese fries...OK. The lady had the same with regular fries, no complaints but not impressed. I think we will try them again maybe another location. This establishment goes on the familiar eats list. Cheap date stamped and approved!",

The beau loves this place and it's easy to see why. Whatever they sprinkle in the meat is addicting. Turkey burger FTW and don't forget to try the sweet potato fries. SO GOOD.",

        "text": "I have been wanting to try Grindhouse for a while and was finally able to check it out. It was worth the wait. I got the Apache style burger double- green chiles, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, grilled onions and tortilla strips. Everything worked perfectly together. Adding chipotle ranch sauce pushed it over the top as one of the best burgers I've ever had. I could tell the burger was made fresh. \n\nWe went on a Wednesday night about an hour or so before closing and got in and out with no problem. The guy bringing out burgers was very attentive and quick. The only not so positive critique I have is the portion size. The burger size is perfect for one and not 2. Already planning my next visit.",

        "text": "This place was awesome. I went here during a visit to Atlanta.  I wanted a burger and yelp provided this place. I loved that you could customize your burger or choose from their own creations. I ordered a turkey burger with swiss, pepper jack, and pimento cheese, tomatoes, pickles, the house habanero sauce and mayo. I was disappointed that they did not have honey mustard sauce, but the fact that they had Sriracha sauce in the table instead of hot sauce made me happy. I was able to create a creamy Sriracha sauce for my fries. Those crinkly fries were cooked just right. \n\nMy significant other ordered the Yankee burger and said it was delicious. He also order a drink, the John Dandy (I believe that is the name) and he said that it was good and he tasted no alcohol (it crept up on him later). \n\nI was also grateful that they have vegetarian and vegan options as a friend is vegan, do she order the black bean hummus as an appetizer and the veggie burger and Fries for her meal. She said everything was good. I tasted the black bean hummus and it was good. \n\nHer husband ordered and I cannot remember the burger he ordrred, but he said everything was good. too. \n\nAt this place, you place your order and then find a seat. That's cool with me. We have a place in Richmond that is that way, too. It has a heated enclosed patio, too. It's not very big and there was a line when we arrived, but it moved rather quickly. \n\nI will definitely eat here upon another visit to Atlanta.",
