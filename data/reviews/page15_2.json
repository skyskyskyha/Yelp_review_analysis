It's such a cool hang out spot! Not much room indoors, but there's plenty of seating out on the patio with other neighboring eateries! Botiwalla is a must try and I hear they have some other dope locations! \n\nUpdate: I think everyone was off work today! We can tell that there have been some changes made to some of our favorites! The lamb burgers seem pre-made and lack the original grill flavor. The koladas had some kind of bite to them that made them very unpleasant to drink.

I had gotten their chicken tikka sandwich when I was in Asheville, and it was so good I ordered it here at Botiwalla. It was slightly different than the chai Pani take, and I prefer the Chai Pani version. I also had a mango lassi, which was very good! I would definitely get the mango lassi again. \n\nI liked the design of the Asheville location more too. This one you could tell that you are within a market/mall, which had its benefits but made it noisy. Very similar decor to other locations.",

It wasn't a strong cola taste and the tamarind came through. I felt like I was in India again, reliving my childhood trips. The decor is awesome as well. \n\nI'm sad I didn't get to eat the paneer tikka wrap. If you go, eat in there so you don't have to deal with the same issue that happened to me.",

        "text": "Apparently, Botiwalla has a \"real\" brick and mortar store elsewhere in Atlanta, but this little \"take out\" location in Ponce Market food hall fit the bill just perfectly. \n\nAfter looking over the menu and reading some reviews, I decided to get the lamb sliders. They were great. I'd suggest getting something else from somewhere else in Ponce and splitting the sliders (with a side of fries) with a friend, because they literally give you two little burgers (like McDonald's cheeseburger sized). \n\nI also tried some Lays masala chips, which were interesting and the potato filled bread appetizer, also interesting. I really liked the green sauce that came on a few of the dishes and used some of my friend's sauce for my burgers. \n\nIn addition to naan wraps and lamb burgers, they also offer mango lassi and alcoholic beverages. \n\nMy only complaint is that they close exactly at 8pm on Sundays. Just don't be late!!",

The vintage art work in the cafe and the Indian music make it feel so cultured and cozy. I absolutely loved the food! I tried a Malai chicken roll and my bf tried the Lamb kabob roll. We also both ordered their chai tea which came with these delicious cookies!

        "text": "I kinda wrote off Botiwalla after trying them once but decided to give them a second chance and was glad I did!\n\nFirst off, if you aren't a cilantro consumer, be warned that there are lots of dishes here that contain the herb. Be sure to request no cilantro upon ordering, and you should be okay.\n\nThe initial visit, I'd gotten the chicken tikka roll ($10.49), and the meat was kind of dry, and the roll just seemed okay overall. The naan really stood out in my mind however. Very fresh and soft and just buttery enough. \n\nThe subsequent time, I ordered the desi salad with chicken tikka ($11.49, other options available) which was delightful. The cumin-lime vinaigrette was plentiful and added a brightness to the salad. The chicken tikka was not dry and was a little zippy but wouldn't set your mouth aflame. I liked the crunchy colorful cabbage along with cashews and sev (those tiny crunchy noodles). Portion sizes are actually reasonable, given that you're in pricey Ponce City Market. \n\nI have to say the customer service is exemplary here. The women taking my orders are happy to help with any questions or special requests. The fellas handing me my to-go orders smile and wish me well, unlike the guys at some other PCM restaurants that just respond to your \"Thank you\" with silence and blank faces. Botiwalla is also efficient at preparing orders; you'll likely only wait a few minutes. To pass the truncated time, I peruse the sundries for sale in the festive dining area. Looking forward to sipping on a mango lassi my next visit!",

I love the street food style- a lot more convenient when taking it to go and makes sense logistically in the food market. The SPDP appetizer was INSANITY- soooo delicious and creamy and flavorful. I hardly even knew what I was eating and I was so in love! Decent sized portion for the price as well! I will think of these little puffs for the rest of life. The masala smashed potatoes were tasty but kind of just potatoes, we thought they could use a little more spice but we enjoyed them none the less. We also had the tandoori fired veggie kebab. Naan was just right and the veggie was just saucy and flavorful enough without being messy or overwhelming. Food was out quick and we would definitely be back!! Perfect option at Ponce City Market!",

Both have a bit bit of heat and LOADS of flavor. The salad includes red and white cabbage, pickled daikon, carrots, scallions, sesame seeds, scallions, spiced cashews and cumin-lime dressing. The portions are large - I always leave feeling overly full. I want to try everything on the menu, but the salad is so delicious, I seem to order it every time I visit. I promise to order something different next time (I'm looking at you SDPD, masala potatoes, and wraps).\n\nThe high tea is also excellent if you visit between 3 and 5. What a great set-up for catching up with a friend over incredible chai and biscuits. If only I could find time to squeeze this ritual into every day, my life would be so much richer (maybe I could aspire to attend high tea once a month?). \n\nThe shop also sells Spicewalla spices, tea and tea biscuits, tiffin boxes, t-shirts, and more.",

        "text": "I knew Botiwalla was going to be good because I'm a big fan of Chai Pani (their sister restaurant)....but WOW they entirely exceeded my already high expectations. Honestly, I never come to PCM because it's usually so crowded but now I might consider braving the crowds just to hit that Botiwalla again. \nWe had the masala smashed potatoes, I had the lamb boti kabab roll, and my dinner buddy had the paneer tikka roll. We also got the mango pickle to add some spice to our rolls. \nHonestly, after finishing dinner I actually considered going back to get another naan wrap/roll. Thankfully they had already closed by that time so I didn't have to test my nonexistent self control. \nThe lamb was unbelievably tender, the desi slaw was crisp and added some tangy balance to the richness of the meat, and topping each bite with raita (the yogurt sauce) and the mango pickle made each bite nearly ecstatic. I couldn't stop talking about how good it was for hours. And that isn't even their most popular dish! \nThe mango pickle is slightly spicy and adds a lovely acidity to whatever you're eating. My dinner buddy really liked his paneer tikka roll as well. \nI am already plotting when I can next go to Botiwalla to try more things. Save me from myself...",

The restaurant tries to compensate for their bad food with aesthetic and ambience, since the restaurant is very picturesque and has a lot of memorabilia from India. I ordered the paneer naan roll and it was terrible, the roll lacked any flavor (which is ironic since they market their spices so much) and the paneer was cut into 2 huge blocks, making it hard to eat. The food wasn't even that warm. I tried the chai and it's doused with sugar, and the restaurant does not have a sugar free option. Overall, I would not come back. If you're coming here for the first time, and are pretty intent on trying something here, I'd try some of their snack foods instead of a meal - perhaps you'd get better luck.",

        "text": "Being my first time inside Ponce City Market, I walked up and down the food court area multiple times, stood in various lines, and at the end of the day, it was the smells and photos on yelp that sent me to Botiwalla.\n\nBotiwalla is an Indian street food restaurant, just a little bit jazzed up/modernized, and it shows, because as often as I hit Indian restaurants, the menu was a breath of fresh air, since I recognized very little of the dishes on the menu.\n\nI did decide to give their Desi Salad with steak tri tips ($11.99) a shot, and based on staff suggestion, I also tried their SPDPs ($4.99).  So what did I think?\n\nThe Desi Salad came with shredded cabbage (red and white), scallions, carrots, roasted cashews, cilantro, sev and came topped with sesame seeds (I left these off) and was \"infused\" with a cumin-lime vinaigrette.  Intermixed were chopped pieces of steak.  Right off the bat, i'll give them their due on the vinaigrette, because each and every fork full was flavored with the vinaigrette, and I enjoyed it.  Sadly, I thought the steak tri tips were kinda dry and super chewy...like jerky type chewy, and that really dinged the dish for me.\n\nThe SPDPs, or Savory Puffed flower crisps were stuffed with potato, onion, cilantro, and chickpea noodles.  They're then piped with sweet yogurt, green and tamarind chutney, and came with 4 pieces.  Listed under their CHAAT dishes, they described these finger foods as dishes where you'd have to chaat (lick) your fingers afterwards.  They are not lying, because as I took a bite of one, all of the insides came rushing out, both in my mouth and all over the place, since it seemed to be just liquid in a fried cup.  I learned the second time and just popped the entire crisp in my mouth and not taking a bite of it.  Flavor wise though,  the SPDPs weren't bad..but they also weren't great\n\nCustomer service at Botiwalla was just fine and there's a decent amount of seating both inside the restaurant, outside seating and also common seating areas in the food court.  Service is fast as well, as I got my dish in less than 5 minutes.\n\nPrice is the other elephant in the room.  When you order a salad and 4 crisps, it stings a bit to pay $18 for that, and in truth, were the prices 10 bucks cheaper, Botiwalla would've definitely received a star more from me.  But when dishes start creeping up to $20, I start becoming more critical.\n\nI didn't have a bad time at Botiwalla, I just thought everything was okay, and for the price, I kinda expected more.  I may be back in the future to give them another shot and change my score, but admittedly, it may be a while.",

        "text": "They serve one of the best lamb burgers that I have ever had it was so delicious! I am rarely in the area, but this is something that you should definitely try and a highlight and staple to this community. I stumbled into this place on accident because I was starving and wanted something quick to eat I came to the right place.  They gave me two reasonably sized delicious patties that fill me up so the portions were good the price was decent. And to cool me off from the summer heat I had a nice refreshing tropical beverage. The food is fresh and tasty.",
