Lobster fritters, Caesar salad (fantastic Caesar), tartare, rack of lamb to share, and the cheesecake. Normally I'm like \"yeah it's a steakhouse...\" about steakhouses but this was notable.",

        "text": "Kevin Rathbun's is a hidden gem inside the Atlanta beltine.  It sits down the hill from the restaurant Ladybird and can be missed if you've never dined there or not paying attention.  But let's not dwell on that part because that's nothing compared to the dining experience.  \n\nMy friends and I started our dinner experience with cocktails but since Covid-19 hit the drink menu isn't available on their online menu so I cannot refer to it for the name.  But please refer to the picture because it looks just like it tasted.  Sparkling, crisp, and floral.  It was such a refreshing drink that I ordered three...truly delightful.  \n\nAs for the food, I ordered the Pan Roasted Salmon.  It was good medium and with every bite you could taste the delicious combinations of the soy cherry sauce along with the fresh cooked vegetables, seasoned to perfection.  Along with this dish, I ordered the Charred Jalapeño Corn.  It added a sweet heat kick to the rest of the meal.  A hint of sweet from the creamy corn and heat from the jalapeño and it was a combination that took my meal to the next level.  \n\nKevin Rathbun Steak is a great place to have an intimate dinner with a date, quiet business dinner to impress a client, or just a place to connect with your friends.  The atmosphere, drinks, and entrees all make for an excellent nightcap.",

Our waiter, Andrew was amazing. He was very knowledgeable and offered recommendations. I enjoyed bacon as an appetizer.  It was really like pork belly. Very tasty. For the main course, I had a NY strip steak. It was very savory. The jalapeño cream corn is so very tasty. \nThe ambience of the space was great for date night or just hanging with friends. The decor is nice. I will definitely return. Staff very friendly and engaging. All staff wore masks and patrons must as well when walking through restaurant.",

Tony was our server and every single recommendation he made was spot on. Definitely the best service we have ever received. The sommelier helped us pick a bottle of wine that fit our tastes and she absolutely nailed it, the wine was incredible. We started with the eggplant fries and the tuna tartare, and both were fantastic. We had the Snake River Farms 16oz wagyu steak, Brussels sprouts, and creamed spinach for the entree which was all absolutely phenomenal, and the peanut butter banana cream pie was the best possible finisher. The ambiance was amazing as well, just an awesome experience here.",

The steak was a 9.1 out of 10.  Perfect temp.  The flavor was great.  You could taste the jalapeño flavor in the corn but there was no spice.  I was expecting just a little kick but it was full of flavor.  The potato was great!  The staff is excellent.  Very attentive. I drink a lot of water and cocktail with my meals and didn't have to wait a second for a sip. It was my birthday dinner so I got the bread pudding for free!

We also got lobster and oysters that were just to die for I would recommend getting the seafood tower. I had an excellent iceberg salad and my constituents got another salad but the name of eludes me. everything was delicious though.  Not only are they known for their steaks they're also known for their seafood. I had the pleasure of tasting their salmon and it was delightful. \n\nThe bar has everything, including my favorite, Chopin Vodka. We have many herbs and vegetables behind the bar and we're happy to create me a custom cocktail that was absolutely perfect. \nVodka, soda, shot of simple syrup, muddled cucumber, and muddled basil. My favorite summer time drink\n\nYou are a know me by now, service service service \nThis is an impeccable team of people in an impeccable atmosphere with impeccable food.\nSpend the time spend the money come here enjoy yourself and leave truly satisfied every single time.

We shared the Mac and cheese, creamed spinach and twice baked potato. The lobster fritters were light and airy. They came in a honey mustard sauce. The filet was DELICIOUS! Cooked perfectly medium rare to my liking. I ordered butter with it which was a great topping. The steak was so juicy and tender, the flavors were so divine. It was sizzling on the plate when served. For the sides: \nMac and cheese: pretty basic, standard Mac & cheese \nTwice baked potato: very buttery\nCreamed spinach: my personal favorite of the sides\nClassic steakhouse side dish in a rich, cheesy cream sauce. \nService was impeccable, servers are coming around routinely to replenish water and clean tables. The ambiance is very romantic and elegant. I had such a pleasant experience here and would highly recommend. Definitely make reservations ahead of time if you do go.",

He gave us excellent service and he made a lot of really great suggestions on what we should order.\n\nI started with the Full Monty- such tender lobster, crab, and shrimp. Wow! Succulent is the word that comes to mind. The oysters were also fresh.\n\nI had the filet mignon with truffle butter and we shared sides of the Mac and cheese, creamed spinach, risotto, and mashed potatoes. Everything was amazing.

        "text": "We visited Kevin Rathbun during restaurant week this year. I had never been here so I was excited for the opportunity to try it at a slightly less expensive price point. The regular menu options were available but we both opted to do the restaurant week. This is a 3 course meal for $40. You pick 1 appetizer, main, and dessert each. \n\nDrinks (not included): I forget the name but we got what was equivalent to an Old Fashion. $12 each, beer was $7. Old Fashions are my go to drinks and I thought they did a pretty good job making it. The beer wasn't really worth it in my opinion.\n\nAppetizers: Grilled Baby Octopus & KRS Wagyu Short Rib Yakitori.They were both sooo good! The short rib was my favorite. We were told that it was smoked for over 8 hours! No wonder it was so tender. hmmmm yum.\n\nMain: 6oz filet mignon & Smoked Pork Tenderloin. I prefer the tenderloin over the filet but that's just because I'm not big on eating beef. \n\nWe also got an additional side ($9) to supplement our meals, but it wasn't really worth it. The scallop sweet potatoes were nice, but not that nice. Plus, it was kind of salty. \n\nDessert: Creme caramel with fresh berries (it's really just a flan) & Chocolate ganache cake. The cake was slightly bitter but complemented the flan very well. Sweet vs. bitter.\n\nOverall, I recommend coming here on a special occasion, during restaurant week to try it out, or just when you feel like splurging. Service was excellent as well. Our server, Rick, was very attentive and professional.",

Valet parking, top-notch service.\n\nThe appetizers and sides are plentiful, we had the thick bacon and lobster rolls along with the scalloped potatoes, onion rings, jalapeno corn and shrooms. Everything was outstanding and the wine parings were perfect.\n\nThe steaks are humongous. We split a bone-in, dry-aged cowboy for 2 that arrived already cut into bite sized pieces. It was good, not great. Really expected a juicier, tastier steak.\n\n$360 for an excellent night and new experience is a good deal for me, we enjoyed ourselves, just not sure about the value given the other local options for far less. We will try again, it is a wonderful place.",

We ordered a round of drinks which were prepared very well. For my Yelp drinkers...the bartender made the drinks super strong!  We ordered several appetizers once we learned they were shareable. All of them were great. My least favorite was the sweet potato one. It wasn't sweet.  We ordered burgers and steak and we ate every last bite. The burgers while served separate of any side were double patties and huge. It was worth the $21. \n\nThe ambiance is very sexy, fun, and romantic. It's ideal for a small intimate group. We were seated in a round sectional and it was perfect for our party of 4.\n\nI'll definitely return!!!",

The short rib appetizer was phenomenal and wine selection is expansive, even by the glass. The beef carpaccio lacked flavor. Pork belly (bacon) appetizer was pretty good.

        "text": "If you want to place to take Instagram photos that you can tag where you overpaid for a terrible food and service  experience than this is the place for you.\n\nThe other day I visited with three friends, not having been there for a few years, I was utterly disappointed. I am no stranger to find dining in Atlanta, but people like Kevin Rathburn need to meet the expectations of their guests, although without a doubt, he can sleep easy knowing that 90% of people will not complain, or even notice where his establishment falls short as they continue to eat from the troth. One thing I like about traveling outside the US is restauranteurs and chefs actually take pride in their work. But not Ruthbun.  10% of people, read a menu and have expectations for what they are about order and pay for (that is if they can even get their order in). \n\nThe service was horrendous. I recognized the server,  a well spoken older African American gentlemen, one that's been there for a very long time. To say he had a chip on his shoulder is an understatement; But alas good help is hard to find these days. It took us 30 minutes to get our first drink order in. We tried to order appetizers at the same time but the server told us he would be right back, and we saw him 15 or 20 minutes later. \n\nThe $eafood tower appetizer, was not a tower at all, it was a plate. A few oysters, a couple of lobster claws and a few other bits and pieces is not gonna cut it. The guests ordered and expected a tower. We let the server know,  Who quickly reminded us of how much seafood prices have gone up. All of us read the news, we know supply chain and prices are up, we don't need excuses, we expected a tower, so remove the word tower off your menu!\n\nAfter the starters were served we waited again to place are entree order, and after flagging down another server we had ours return. After placing our order, and needing to order wine we found out that our server had gone home for the evening and we have been transferred to a new person.\n\nWe did order 4 steaks, and 4 sides.\nThe steaks were good, cooked correctly to temperature and nicely served.\nThe four sides arrived completely cold. ALL FOUR!\nWe ordered a nice bottle of wine for the table, and we had it in put in a decanter. \nAll in all, we enjoyed the steak and wine, but the rest of the experience was dreadful.\nCan say we will be back anytime soon.",

From the moment I stepped thru their front door I was greeted with arms wide open smiles by the staff and an aromatic ambience that reminded me of outdoor cooking at my grandparents in Arkansas with hickory chips my grandfather had just cut from a tree on their land! \nIt's taken me a few days to write this review because I can't seem to find prolific words to describe the experience. Our waiter, Rick, had to be one of the most attentive and skilled waiters in the business. He has a strong sense of discernment and reads you well. And we women are crazy because we can be famished yet so indecisive about our choices. Problem solved! My Spicy Margarita(ATF) was unlike any other and our appetizer was decadent yet savory and the beef literally melted in your mouth like warm butter on a hot pancake. The eggplant fries come with a sauce made of Tabasco and powdered sugar!!!! DONT KNOCK IT ~TIL YOU TRY IT!!!Every flavor has been carefully prepared to maximize the pleasure centers of ALL of your taste buds! If you're reading this review then this should be your last read. STOP  Pick up the phone or go online now and make that reservation. Look no further. The story behind the Chef KEVIN Rathbun is one that will touch each and everyone because his passion for his craft and compassion for his staff is unique and inspiring and Lord knows we could all use more of that in our lives. The presentation is a perfectly woven tapestry that you get to walk away with and share with others like I'm doing right now with you! Thank you Rick! You're truly the best ever and thank you for making my evening a defining culinary experience I will surely never forget!",

        "text": "What beautiful indoor aesthetic. The bar is just dark enough and welcoming. Outdoor seating looked lovely too. Irv the bartender-he is the best! No nonsense, personable, informative,and gave really great suggestions. I had a whiskey based drink that featured K. Rathbun's whiskey. I'm generally not a brown liquor drinker, but I wanted a full Rathbun experience. It was smooth, balanced, and let the simple ingredients do the talking. After discussing with Irv- I decided to have tuna tartare for my appetizer and steak tartare appetizer as my dinner. Why? Because I generally order a tuna tartare if it's on the menu AND Irv couldn't say enough good things about it. I got the steak tartare because it features a cut of steak I don't see everywhere (spinalis). Albeit raw, this way I got to try Rathbun's seafood and steak without getting too full. Irv mentioned the creamed corn as being a staple side at Rathbuns- I knew I wouldn't finish it, but wanted to try. Irv informed me they can halve sides! So it was a no brainer. Ended up being too much food for me, but the cleanest plate of them all was the tuna tartare!! This is one of-if not-the best tuna tartare I've had. Fresh fish. Crispy puffed cracker/pappard type accoutrement was needed and welcomed. There was a freshness while still offering an umami. Wasabi essence was present in every bite without it being overwhelming. I would come back here just for this tuna tartare. A person at the bar asked me what I ordered (I suppose people get curious when your eyes are rolling Yo the back of your head with every bite). I told them and they said it sounded good, but they don't like raw fish-I knew then we couldn't be friends. The spinalis tartare. Happy to finally try this fatty, tender, non-grisly meat. I really got to see it naked by trying it raw. It was not covered by, but enhanced by, the usual tartare ingredients (capers et al). This tartare came with botarga and fish eggs on the plate. This \"fishyness\" with certain bites of the tartare I did not like so much. I avoided those items, and the tartare with the accompanying Sardinian crackers was sublime. The creamed corn was not too creamy, fresh sweet corn, and a little kick. If you like corn- try this. Corn isn't my favorite unless it's in the form of a tortilla...so I'm admittedly not the best judge. Bread service was two perfectly sized pieces of focaccia. It's worth trying. Served warm. Welcomed while drinking a string, balanced, tasty whiskey beverage. If I were to return again today (I fear I might-the tuna tartare has me whipped!) I'd get the tuna tartare and a drink that Irv suggests. You really should come to Kevin Rathbun's steakhouse . I truly don't think you'll be disappointed.",
