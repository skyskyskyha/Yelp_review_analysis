The atmosphere was quite pleasant as well - nice decor, clean, lots of people but not packed - If the owner reads this post - please start offering a Sunday brunch - we would come every Sunday!",

        "text": "We came for dinner after a rave review from a friend and we were not disappointed! We arrived around 4p after a show at the Fox. The staff were quick to welcome and seat us; very friendly and attentive.  The ambiance was just what I would expect for the Midtown location with background music that is chill and groovy and decor that is minimalist and sleek. Plenty of seating with room to grow.\nThe food: everything was delicious!\nBeing our first time we order several items from the appetizers and small plates and one entree. All the food was served within 10-12m of ordering and sizzling hot. SO flavorful, tender and perfectly seasoned. \nThe Scallion Bubble Pancake was a great wow dish and perfect way to start off the service. The curry dipping sauce delicious. \nPork Soup Dumplings were a treat! We were told it would require extra time to prepare and it was worth the wait (although they didn't take as long).\nThe Crispy Mushrooms were crunchy and pillowy with a spicy crunchy topping that ramped up the flavor.\nSweet & Sour Spareribs were so tender you almost didn't need to chew. And the pomegranate seeds were a nice break from the sweetness of the sauce.\nFennel Smoked Duck Rolls were on the specials menu and the star of the table. Delicate, crispy, tender. Served with sweet duck sauce for dipping. \nBlack Pepper Beef & Asparagus, plenty for two people. Just the right amount of spice for us lightweights to intense heat.\nAs we dined a steady stream of people came through the door, quickly filling the place. The staff remained attentive, quick and efficient and always friendly.\nWe will definitely be back!",

The far majority of dishes were delicious and they were all very very spicy! They use a ton of Szechuan peppers in their food and it's seriously like numbing spicy. I would be caution eating the Szechuan dishes if you are not very good with spice. Only real complaint is that there basically was no soup in the soup dumplings which was unfortunate. Overall a really delicious restaurant though.",

Then we all split some Fried Mochi Rice Cakes.\n\nThree Pepper Chicken - 9/10: The food was delicious. I definitely want to try this with Beef next time because I heard good things. The sauce was very flavorful and I had enough for another meal even though I went in starving going in. \n\nSzechwan Kung Pao Tofu - 10/10: So good! The tofu was cooked so nicely (I am picky about this too) and I am not even vegetarian but I would definitely consider ordering this next. The sauce was also delicious. \n\nSzechwan Chili Chicken - 8/10: It was really yummy and sauce had flavor. I wish it was a little spicier, but other than that amazing! \n\nSERVICE:\n10/10\nStaff was so nice and fast with our food. We got seated very quickly too!\n\nAMBIANCE:\n10/10\nRight in midtown, but very peaceful and the seating makes you not feel too crowded. Very inviting place!",

Crispy fresh milk for dessert was super sweet and fun.  The prices are really reasonable, maybe even surprisingly so.  We will definitely go back the next time we are in Atlanta.",

I also took it to go so I bet it's better fresh.The cucumbers were very refreshing but needs some more flavor. I'll definitely come back and try some new things.

The Szechuan chili was beyond good, and if I go back to this restaurant which I will, this will be my first choice. I probably visit there for the roasted duck.

It's not mind blowing but it's pretty good food.\nService was a little slow they served us our main dishes before the appetizers, which came much later even though we ordered them first. Not a huge problem, the waiter explained that the kitchen was really busy so it was understandable.\nAmbiance is good it's just like a normal Chinese restaurant but smaller. Good for large groups of people. Heads up for non Asians, you are supposed to order food and share it with the people you are with! That's the fun part!",

It's as though they accidentally spilled the salt in there and just decided to mix it up.  It seemed to have potential but we couldn't get over the salt.  It was so salty that the water tasted salty and we ordered a new water because we didn't realize the water was fine but the dish left everything tasting salty after.\n\nThe pineapple shrimp was good. It's served cold and we found it refreshing and tasty.\n\n\nService 2/5\n\nAfter waiting for an unusually long time for our main dishes to come out the server asked if we wanted anything else.  We said, no just the dishes.  She asked if we placed our order with someone else.  We said, no we did that with her and she realized she forgot to ring our dishes up.  It wasn't busy at all there so I'm not sure what went wrong.  We decided to just cancel it and go elsewhere.\n\nAtmosphere 2.5/5\n\nThe place has a mixed vibe.  It looks like it's trying to be elevated and chic but has very dirty and sticky menus and they don't bus the tables as you go despite servers walking past your tables.  The service and cleanliness really detract from the attempt to be a bit upscale.",

        "text": "You'll find most of the good ethnic cuisine (that term seems dated) in Atlanta on the north side of town and for inspired Chinese food, Buford Highway would be the epicenter or even further afield in suburbs like Duluth. Recently, quality Chinese food has made its way closer to the center of Atlanta. This new spot in Midtown is in a complex with a bunch of other restaurants and convenient validated parking in the building. I didn't mind driving to the other Hai in Decatur, but this one is a little nicer looking and more central, though I believe the menu is about the same. We always order Grandma's Noodles, which comes with a delectable vinegar and hot chili sauce. I would also recommend the Dragon Eggplant in Spicy Garlic Sauce, Stir Fried Bok Choy with Tofu Skin, Mapo Tofu and Crispy Mushroom. The cocktails are decent and not something that's usually available alongside Chinese food. This mix of Szechuan and classic Chinese American dishes in a restaurant that's not sad looking is going to be a success in Midtown.",

        "text": "I just had the Mongolian beef Friday May 12th, 2023. It was lacking flavor, the meat itself had a lot of black particles on it like the grill wasn't clean. Absolutely no taste couldn't really say it was Mongolian beef. It was more like the ingredientsto make the dish without the flavor. Will not be going back",
