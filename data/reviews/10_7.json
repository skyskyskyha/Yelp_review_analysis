The bartenders, Steve and Steve are the best and usually have our drinks ready before we can belly up to the bar.  Your life isn't complete without trying the Thick Cut Sizzling Bacon with Brooklyn French  sauce.\n\nTheir steaks are amazing, sides incredible (although be warned that the cheesy mash potatoes are extremely hot so roof of mouths beware) and the crab cakes are to die for!!!\n\nThe manager Alex always has great wine suggestions and their new patio is incredible. I can't wait for the humidity to drop so I can sit and relax by the fire pit!!!",

        "text": "I have been to this location twice, and to be excited about going back every time says something about any restaurant. Atlanta is a city that loves to eat out, we know that, and with that, tons of restaurants are available. With that said, when it was my wife's Bday i knew that I had to bring her here. First off, valets are always cool and on point, wait staff is extremely helpful and willing to take the extra step to make your experience that much better. So we get there on a Saturday night (made reservations) and got seated right away. Placed an order for Apps and drinks. We had the jumbo lump crab cocktail, and it was so fresh and delicious, which it got finished quickly. Then we placed an order for our entrees; ended up with the 40oz Porterhouse for two, which to me, is the perfect for two. Medium rare, broiled to perfection. Got the Fettuccine Alfredo option as a side, all delicious. To end the evening, our waiter surprised my wife with the baked cookie and ice cream and a candle, that was cool and made her night. Details people, details! This by fair is my favorite steakhouse in Atlanta, period. Check them out!",

        "text": "Birthday dinner at New York Prime was GREAT, Everyone enjoyed their food. The crab cake was the most flavorful item for me . Oyster Rockefeller  was a big hit cause you can barely find them any more in Atlanta. The sides were awesome- the music was a little too loud so people had to talk louder at the table. The bar was packed. Outside seating  was extremely packed. The kitchen was backed up so it took food about an hour  or even longer to come out. Shout out to the bar tender who made the strong drinks. Had a whiskey sour and a manhattan! Order the Lamb Chops for entree . Others or the New York Strip, chicken and Salmon! Oh let me not forget the caesar salad was on point as well. I would most definitely go back and enjoy another night out with friends and family!",

        "text": "I have been coming here due to a dear family friend for many years. Back in town for the holidays & the opportunity to return presented itself.  I would give Andrew our Bartender double the stars if allotted as his service was simply impeccable. \n\nAndrew's presence was immaculate while his persona beamed when he greeted his regulars by name & engagingly welcomed new patrons to the restaurant's bar. Pouring & blending are only the small part of the bartending equation. Showing personality & exuding the art of customer interaction effortlessly, brings the great bar experience all together.   \n\nThe plan for one glass of wine honestly changed due to Andrew's service.  I kindly received his Malbec preferences & after a few of his generous pours, I decided to stay for dinner...other reservations were cancelled. \n\nWith a slight modification, I ordered the Salmon that was prepared blackened & abundantly topped with sautéed Portobello Mushrooms. Preparation, point & price paired nicely. \n\nI've always prefer how NYP offers their sides - individual or table size. I opted for the individual serving of the Garlic Spinach which was still a big portion. I'm never disappointed with my meals here & decided to share the good vibes by bestowing my ManBaby with his favorite dish - the Garlic Chicken with a 1 pound loaded giant Baked Potato.\n\nSuch a blessing to be amongst one of my favored people Randy F., who introduced me to NYP back in the mid 90's. \n\nSeeing familiar faces, meeting new ones, enduring a close knit atmosphere with soothing live music, delighting in a good meal & fabulously served by Andrew, made my long over due return to New York Prime enjoyable throughout.",

Leo paced our meal to where we could enjoy everything and take our time, asking if we had any questions and checked up on us to make sure we had everything we needed.

We've tried other restaurants for special occasions, and I always end up wishing I had just gone to New York Prime. Period.\n\nLet me tell you why: consistency. When I come here, I know I am going to get amazing service and the food is going to be perfect every single time. That speaks volumes, especially with the money you're spending and the fact that it's a special occasion. You want it to be a great experience!\n\nThe steaks are out of this world. So delicious and juicy and perfect every time, with just enough char to make it interesting. I realize the charred exterior may sound off-putting to some, but we love it and I encourage you to at least give it a chance.\n\nAlso, three words: cheesy mashed potatoes. I cannot emphasize this enough. I literally have dreams about these cheesy potatoes, they are exquisite. \n\nFinally, since we always come for a birthday or anniversary, they are kind enough to provide us with a complimentary dessert at the end, which is just such a class-act thing to do, in my opinion. \n\nSo yeah. I absolutely love it here. It's classy. It's expensive. It's sooo worth it.",

I think they were simply lacking in seasoning or flavor on their steak (I've had better at Ruth's Chris -- and my favorite is still Le Moo in Louisville, KY). The side dishes of mushrooms and Brussel sprouts outshined the steaks. The service here was impeccable, however.\n\nWarning: The inside felt unsafe during the pandemic because it was so crowded, but, fortunately, we had reserved outdoor seating, which felt a lot safer.",

Last night was a packed house we had to wait about 10 minutes for our reserved table. They had a great table available for us. Steaks came out charred for sure even at medium rare. Really took away from the flavor of the steak. Too crispy on the outside. Noticed the couple next to us sent there steaks back with wrong temperatures.\n\nMay consider another visit based on atmosphere and super attentive staff. Will definitely request less charring.",

Next up the wind almost toppled a heater next to us but nothing could compare to the treatment by the Geno Dew, the maitre'd for what occurred next. An adjacent table with whom ours had zero conversation with, upon leaving as we were getting our dinner, approached our table in total lunatic breakout.  Threatening us, cussing, berating, completely insane.  Once escorted out leaving us in complete shock, all that Dew could offer was to \"enjoy your meal\"! He was more concerned with our calling the police, speaking with others for contact info than the ridiculous harmful experience we'd just encountered.  Was an absolute joke, we were devastated and Dew did NOTHING to recognize and console our group.  His condescending and arrogant attitude was a disgrace to any/all \"5 star\" restaurants. Do yourself a favor and stay with Rathbun's, Hals or Bones...even Waffle House! They treat all customers with class and go above and beyond!",

        "text": "Awesome background Valentine's Day dinner from prime. 5 stars across the board.  Nothing bad from me on this restaurant. Customer service was superb from valet to the host to our table an waiter. The bottle still water was chill, my glass of prosecco was chill. The only thing that was a little turn down was the Caesar salad it was a little salty other than that thumbs up. Next we order our entrees which was 22oz rib steak medium well with large bake potato loaded and new York strip with a large bake potato and caramelized onions on the side. That 22oz was so freaking good I couldn't finish it of course, which made a nice doggy bag. Over all, it was a awesome experience to have with your love one on a romantic night. I would definitely be back again.",

My friend who was hosting the dinner for some reason called and they informed us that they needed to switch the reservation to 9pm. So, had she not called, we would've arrived at the restaurant with no table. However, although we did arrive at 9, we were able to sit down until 10. On top of that, the only reason we were able to sit down was because I had come to  see if the table was ready, and it had been sitting ready and empty for at least 10 minutes. The hostess did not even walk us to the table. Furthermore, the food was just bad; no further explanation needed. They even filled up my friend's sprite with water. 0/10 do not recommend.",

New York Prime restored our faith in quality food with exceptional service.\n\nOur waiter, Kyle, was fantastic. He was attentive without being intrusive. Our drinks were never below a quarter without being offered a fresh one. The meal was properly coordinated with each course coming perfectly timed as we completed the last.\n\nMy wife had the filet and I had a strip; both steaks done to our liking. The bisque was very good and had plenty of meat in it. We had to take the cheesecake to go but it exceeded expectations as well.\n\nWe will be back",

The food was fantastic, I am from NY and have dined at many steakhouses, New York Prime is by far the best food I've had at a steakhouse. Appetizers we had the Oysters Rockefeller, Jumbo Baked Shrimp, and crab cakes. All three were amazing! Entree we had the New York Strip 16oz and the Bone-In rib 22oz with a side of cheesy mash. Steaks were perfectly cooked and charred just the right amount. I will absolutely be back here on my next visit to Atlanta!",

The ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful, and amusingly there were steam punk cosplayers from a local convention at the bar. We started off with the Oysters Rockefeller, which were just amazing. Personally, I liked it better than the baked shrimp but both were extremely fresh that I could still taste the saltwater.  I ordered the Petite Steak and it was one of the best steaks of my life; I ordered it medium-well and it was amazingly tender and well-seasoned. My mother ordered the crab cakes, she said it was good but she said it was a bit salty (take that with a grain of salt though :)). My father ordered the Sea Bass and said it was a tad bit dry but it was very good. For dessert we ordered the Butter Cake, which was huge but very delicious. I also got a complimentary desert for my birthday, which was very nice. The service was A+ and although I forgot the name of our server, he was very nice and we chatted about our college experiences. Overall, highly recommend and I don't regret spending my birthday dinner there!",

After we hade portioned the sides, I noticed there was a 'made in China' tag that had been deep fried into our brussel sprouts. The waiter never came over to check after the food was served, so I had to flag him down. He apologized and took them back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, we cut into the steak. We ordered medium and it came out raw. I knew it was raw, despite the darkness in the restaurant. I took my phone out and used the flash light. It was definitely raw. I had to flag him down again. They took the cut up $85 steak back and threw it back in the oven, brought it out, and didn't even come back to check if the temp was good. A manager never came out and apologized. I've never had an experience like this at a restaurant of this supposed caliber. It doesn't matter what grade of meat you have if you can't cook it. As we were leaving, I asked to speak with the manager. He had just walked up. He said he was sorry and that no one had alerted him. He gave me his card and said to call if we came back. I honestly, don't care to go back. We would've been better off going to Little Alley. At least the server and manager are present and ask if everything was good there.  I expected better customer service and food for the price point.\n\nAdditionally, the restaurant did not follow proper social distancing guidelines. The guy next to us (within 4 feet of our table) proceeded to pull his chair around to where he was within 2 feet of our table.",

The lobster and shrimp bisque had hood amount of protein but salty. Filet cooked Pittsburgh style (little salt with butter cooked at 1700 degrees) was the best steak I ever had. Not too pretty on the outside at that heat but it was cooked perfectly and very juicy. All the side we're good, my favorite was the mushrooms. Service was great, attentive and prompt. Very classy with live music. Only downside was the people smoking cigars at the bar. This place became one of my favorites.",

We made reservations online. This was our first time eating here we were celebrating our 9 year anniversary. \n\nI ordered a salad to start and we both ordered steaks with creamy spinach and southwestern corn. The steaks were absolutely amazing!!! They didn't require any sauce whatsoever. Since it was our anniversary they gave us a dessert on the house it was a warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. That was the best cookie I've ever eaten and I don't like chocolate. \n\nThe only thing that I did not like about the restaurant was the smoking of the cigars. I don't like to be around smoke, I don't smoke. It was annoying to have to eat with the smell of smoke. It was worse that when I got home my clothes and hair smelled like it.

There should have been no reason for the delay in receiving your meal. As for your incorrect steak temperature, we broiled all our steaks pittsburgh-style on a 1700 degree broiler that creates a charred outside, and as noted on our menu, we don't recommend cooking temperatures from medium well and above. That was likely the issue. Despite this recent experience, we know we can still wow you and hope you'll give us another chance.",
