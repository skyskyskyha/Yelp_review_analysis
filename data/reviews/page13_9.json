        "text": "Wow! Where have I been to just be coming to this wonderful Italian restaurant? Called same day for a 9pm reservation on Mothers Day weekend. We arrived 30 minutes early and was able to sit quickly. \n\nWine: Asked for recommendation from our server similar to a taste of sangria but not too sweet. He suggested the Lambrusco Ca De Medio which is awesome. \n\nI had the Caesar salad which is very good. I told the server that it would have been perfect if it had anchovies. I was already mid way into the salad and he said if I want it, they have some and brought a good bit of anchovies. Talk about excellent service. \n\nEntree: My husband and I both had the Tortelli de Mele (House Signature dish).  I didn't want to have the same dish but the server suggested that we get it because it is that good. He said entire tables order it. Wow! I'm glad I listened to him. It has great flavor of both savory and a tad of sweetness. The pasta is al dente and the extra meat outside is great. \n\nThe Chef's special dessert for the today is the Bailey's cheesecake. It is fluffy and the crust is nice. I'm funny about desserts as my Mom is a pastry chef but this is pretty good. I would've wanted just a bit more Baileys flavor but it's still good. \n\nDefinitely coming back again! I'm impressed",

        "text": "So I heard midtown is a foodie part of the area in Atlanta and I had to try one restaurant while in town. Made a reservation on open table and took a taxi from my hotel. Between Uber and taxi, it was about $8 each way.\n\nThey have quite a nice wine list and plenty is available by the glass. Cozy inside, actually each tables were a tad too tight.\n\nSo many dishes looked so good but since it was my first time, I had to try their house signature dish, Tortelli di Mele, ravioli filled with Granny Smith Apple, sausage and parmigiano. First bite of this ravioli, it was a mix of slightly sweet and salty, perfect harmony of different taste. No wonder why it is their signature dish.\n\nI saw several appetizers looked so good but I had to leave  enough room for desert... as I was reading their reviews online prior to my visit, I saw their tiramisu was very good. I love tiramisu, I even ate tiramisu every day for two weeks while in Europe one time... oh their tiramisu was very good, the whole thing quickly went somewhere within 20 seconds of being served in front of me.  I throughly enjoyed it and washed it off with a nice cup of macchiato espresso. \n\nService was very good, knowledgeable about wine and the food, attentive and friendly. Definitely worth the taxi ride from downtown.",

My ravioli (and everyone else's food) was a melt in your month experience. One to be savored for sure!\nThe portions are not big, but filling.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and used the yelp 25% off coupon which was awesome!\n\nTo end the night, we had sorbet inside of a lemon and tiramisu! I wish I had taken more photos but the lighting was low and I wanted to savor the experience.\n\nDef will be coming here again!",

I rarely give bad reviews but I had to come on here to let everyone know since most of the reviews are by elite accounts which are probably fake reviews.\n\nThe restaurant has an amazing ambience and the waiters are very nice. However the food plate presentation were unappealing and lacked taste and flavor. I had the risotto with lobster and it was just awful. \n\nI also had the arugula salad. At first they forgot to put pine nuts on there so I had to ask for it. Then the arugula salad itself was so DRY! No sort of dressing, just straight out of the bag and dropped on the plate with goat cheese and cranberry.\n\nI just think they need to work on their food presentation and better seasoning.",

Sat down promptly and my server was so great. I took his recommendation and ordered the green apple pesto ravioli I think that's what it was called or at least that's part of it and holy cow was it amazing. It was an explosion of goodness in your mouth. I would have never ever ordered that dish without his recommendation. \nI'm still loving that dish. I had the salad to start and it was good as well. \n\nOne note- it's very dim and hard to see your menu at night, many guests were using their phone lights.",

Let me tell you my experience which I really hope is not common. Two people ordered the same shrimp pasta dish. Both dishes get placed at the same time. One has 8 shrimp pieces and barely any sauce. The other has 2 shrimp pieces and the noodles swimming in pasta water. We ask the waiter to why the inconsistency? The answer was that the dish is made in a batch and the range of the shrimp is from 2 to 6 per dish. They took the dish back and threw on 2 additional shrimp rather than recreating the dish.\nThe answer and the way to fix the situation literally put us off our appetite. Overall the meal was bland, service was ok but I'm still waiting for the spoon I requested.",

When you first enter you are greeted by the bar which is fairly small and then that runs into the main dining room.\n\nFood/drink: For dinner we had the Tagliatelle Verdi Alla Bolognese, Chicken Parmesan with Tortellini, a bottle of red wine, and Tiramisu for dessert. Both pasta dishes were delicious and the pasta was perfectly al dente. The Tiramisu was light and moist...a great way to end dinner; and the service was pretty good as well. \n\nThe only thing I would have preferred was if there was more space between the tables so that you are not so close to the adjacent diners. Other than that, I would certainly go back to this spot.",

Weird...\nI was lucky with my dish, I ordered a potato gnocchi which was quite good.\nBut my husband thought his tagliatelle verdi all'a bolognese was just bad.

The prices are reasonable and everything is fresh. \n\nWe started with appetizers, bruschetta, then moved to the main entree, a cheese tortellini with grilled chicken. I found it a little dry but delicious. It was my birthday dinner so they gave me a dessert, tiramisu. It wasn't the best I've ever had. Those two things brought it down a notch but I'd go back there again for more pasta.",

        "text": "I came here for a birthday dinner and even though our party was not there the whole time, they were very patient with us as I could understand that they wanted to flip tables so that they could maximize the amount of people there. We luckily had reservations and the last person in our party already knew what she wanted so that wasn't that big of a problem. \n\nInside, it's pretty much feels like a living room. One big room along with a bar and tables. I ordered their Chicken Cannelloni. I thought they were pretty delicious. We also had their bruschetta and a caprese salad as appetizers. The experience overall was pretty great. One thing was if you go, they keep the place quite cool out in the dining room, so don't be surprised you getting cold if you sit under the vent.\n\nThere isn't any free parking for this place, park right across the street if you want or one in the back. You're still going to have to pay but it's better than getting a ticket.",

Inside the tables are set close to each other. Service very friendly and almost to quick to go from one course to another.\n\nBefore I could finish my caprese salad which was fresh and very good, my entree showed up.  Better timing needed between courses.\n\nI ordered the lobster Ravioli which was listed as a specialty.  The dish was very rich and tasty. The stuffing boardered on being too salty. Right on the edge. I'd order again after asking about salt level.\n\nI rode an Uber to get there and back so can't offer advice on parking.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the portions could be a bit bigger or a couple of dollars cheaper",

Unfortunately I live in Philadelphia and only stumbled upon this place during a work trip. \n\nIt's a hidden neighborhood .  I actually walked right by it not even knowing it was a restaurant because it looks like a house (I believe it is a house that was rehabbed into a restaurant).  There's a nice homey feel on inside as well.  It feels like you visiting grandmas house for dinner. \n\nSee detailed info on food on my pics...",

        "text": "I do love that this is walking distance for my bf and I. We came here for a date night, and it was an overall really great experience. There was a bit of a wait (about 30 minutes), so we went for a walk outside because the entrance area is wayyy too tight for more than any one party to stand around waiting for their table. Luckily, it wasn't terribly cold that night that we were able to wait outside. \n\n_ Gorgonzola Walnuts & Goat Cheese Truffles $10\nThis was pretty good and came with two pieces of crusty bread. I didn't know what to expect. Because of the word truffles, I expected the truffles of the mushroom variety, but in actuality, we got truffle shaped balls of goat cheese. Which was so creamy, and really delicious. A surprise for sure. \n\n_ Ravioli Di Funghi $17\nI had a few options in mind, and the waiter steered me in the direction of the funghi ravioli. It was a solid choice. The mushrooms were sauteed beautifully and the ravioli was perfectly cooked. Lots of delicious flavor in one bite, absolutely. The spiralized zucchini was an... interesting addition. I thought it was unnecessary, to be completely honest. I'm not complaining because hey, more vegetables to eat, but it didn't particularly add anything special to the dish. The only real negative to this dish was that it had too much oil. It was pretty greasy. I know the mushrooms are tossed in olive oil, but it was too much. \n\n_ Cheese Tortellini with Grilled Chicken $19\nMy boyfriend got the cheese tortellini dish and while the flavor was spot on. Some of the pasta was slightly undercooked, a few seconds shy of al dente. \n\nFoodwise, I think they know their flavors and they do them well. I think there are a few things to work on for improvement, but overall, this is a solid restaurant for a date night in midtown. The waiter was incredibly friendly. Took really good care of us and made sure we were having a good time. \n\n* One negative, there was a small nail sticking upwards out of my chair seat poking my leg. The waiter was quick to change out the chair though as soon as I mentioned it.",

They will take your reservation and tell you when you arrive that there is no place for you...lie about alternate solutions and rudely tell you to leave. \nWe were a large group, made arrangements a month back and reconfirm a day ahead. We were told when we arrived that they had no place as  our patio spot was unavailable due to the rain, and the inside tables were given away for those patio customers that had arrived before us. Maybe a valid reason, but the way the front reception handled it was just absolutely ridiculous ... told us that she should never have taken our reservation... to walk across the street and wait at a bar where none existed ... told a friend if he was God to predict the weather....rudely telling us to get out of the way ... and told us to leave. Now wait a minute!!!!  This receptionist should be fired and the restaurant needs to review who they hire and how they treat their guest. Never again here!!!",

The taste and different seasons were really great and for a seafood selection at an Italian restaurant, it gave me the best of both worlds!

Social distancing was pretty good as well. \n\nNow the bad part. We had a party of 6. We all ordered something different. Every person in our party enjoys Italian food. However, not a single one of us enjoyed our meal. The prices were okay, on part with nicer restaurants with smaller portions. But the taste just was not there for any of the dishes unfortunately. It was such a nice setting that I was hoping this would not be the case. \n\nI had the calamari, Caesar salad, and Chicken Cannelloni. The calamari wasn't bad. However, it seemed the squid itself was actually over cooked, while the breading was undercooked. The Caesar salad was amazing though. The chicken cannelloni was not the best though. It did not have a ton of flavor. I probably would not be back.",

        "text": "Pasta Da Pulcinella is one of my favorite Italian restaurants I have ever visited. I have been here twice so far and love that they have a menu of \"classics\" and a menu of rotation specials - so you know there will always be some of their great classics but you can try something new each time you visit if you want to. \n\nThe service has been great here both times I've visited - very friendly, accommodating, and quick. Benjamin was our waiter this past time and he let us try two different wines before deciding and we appreciate it so much! \n\nThe food is delicious and portions are just right. I love that the portions are not too huge here like they can be at other Italian restaurants. The first time I came, I got the chicken ravioli and it was DELICIOUS. This time, I got the special spinach gnocchi with chicken and it was also very very good. We also started with the bruschetta. I did like the bruschetta but it was very different from traditional brushchetta (eggplant based rather than tomato based). \n\nTip: They let you change the sauce on most of their dishes, so do not let the sauce on a choice deter you from getting it, they let all three of us try different sauces on our dishes.\n\nI recommend making reservations because they can get pretty crowded. If you are a party of two, I would say be prepared to sit in close quarters to the table next to you because they do jam a lot of tables inside the restaurant. \n\nFor parking: there are a few parking lots across from the restaurant. Seems like the price of these depend on the mood of the attendant, but last time I went I paid $8. \n\nOverall, I love pasta da pulcinella and I will definitely be back.",

        "text": "We chose Pasta Da Pulcinella as our anniversary date. We've been looking for some good Italian food and one of my co workers mentioned that she liked this place. Overall, we enjoyed our night and the food was delicious! We recommend making reservations. We arrived 15-20 minutes ahead of our time and had to wait until closer to our reservation time before they could seat us. A couple arrived behind us without a reservation and I'm not sure if they were able to accommodate. It was busy and packed. \n\nWe ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert. We got the mezzanine ravioli as our appetizer which we thought was ok at first. Then it grew on me after I mixed the sauce a little bit more. The fried ravioli wasn't crispy like we thought it would be. It was more like a soft fry. The filling was delicious. I think maybe there was a bit too much basil for my taste. \n\nMy husband ordered the Tortelli di Mele. He loved it. It was savory with a hint of sweetness. You get a taste of apple with the first bite and then the sausage flavor follows. I ordered the Pappardelle Pasta with sautéed Sea Scallops. It was equally tasty! The scallops were tender and the sauce was a light tomato cream sauce. We loved their pasta! \n\nFor dessert we ordered the creme-brûlée. It was ok. Nothing to write home about.  \n\nPros:\n- delicious pasta! \n- excellent service\n- cute patio. We would have sat outside if it wasn't so muggy. It would be great during the fall and spring. \n- portions were just right. Not too much and not too little. I ended up packing 1/4 of my pasta to bring home. \n- Decent price for the amount of deliciousness in front of you\n\n\nCons:\n- no free parking. We parked in the lot across from the restaurant. We paid 8$. \n- LOUD. It was very loud. We had a hard time hearing each other\n- tight quarters. You're almost sitting at the next table. I think we had maybe 6 inches between the tables.",
