        "text": "***This review is only for their pasta making class***\nI purchased their pasta making class for my husband and I. I really enjoyed the experience (and the pasta was incredible!). My only turn-off was how hard they were pushing drinks on us the entire time. \n\nBefore the class begins, they conveniently point you to wait at the bar area next to the pasta room. Of course I got a drink! What else is one to do? Then when we shuffle into the pasta room, they introduce the instructor, along with the waiter whose sole job of the night is to fetch the group drinks. The class begins. Twenty minutes later: Anyone need a drink? Another 20 minutes: Dranks, anyone? You get the point.\n\nAt the end of the class, they box up the raw pasta that your poured your blood, sweat, and tears into, and then they serve you the cooked, Bellina version of the pasta. A few days later we cooked our raw pasta at home and threw it in some Rao's Arrabbiata sauce--holy freaking hell, it was the best home-cooked pasta I've ever had in my mouth. \n\nOverall a fun date night but given the class cost $120 for 2 people just to make some noods, my only gripe was that it would have been nice if I have drinks forced down my throat at prices less than $12-$17 a pop.",

        "text": "Had a lovely lunch at the back bar, the bartender was extremely knowledgeable offering a non traditional sparkling red. I had a half order of meatballs to start which were excellent, firm, and flavorful. The Rosa sauce paired with the meatballs was a highlight. And it was served with soft and chewy, fresh focaccia bread to dunk into the extra sauce. \nI also went with the bucatini carbonara which was perfect. But you can't go wrong with any of the pastas bc they made them all fresh in house every day. The pasta was cooked to perfection, crispy bacon chunks, herbs, cheese and an egg yolk took it to the next level. Well done, I really enjoyed it and would come back again the next time I'm in town. Thank you!",

        "text": "This place was located in Ponce City Market. There's two dining options - you can either order up front and they deliver the decision to you or you can enjoy the dine-in experience with a server.\n\nWe opted for the dine-in experience just because we wanted a more intimate setting. The dining space itself was small. There were a couple of high top tables, love seats with cocktail tables, and bar spots available for seating. \n\nThe atmosphere was urban contemporary. It definitely was a very trendy spot to eat. I very much liked the aesthetic of the restaurant. The lights were more dim and made the place feel more romantic causal. \n\nAlthough, it was more intimate, the service was okay. It was much more relaxed. We got what we needed, but it took more time than you would expect in a standard fine dining experience. \n\nThe price was reasonable with pastas ranging in the $14-18. It wasn't anything spectacular. We started off with meatballs. I had the Ragu and my fianc√© had the Pomodoro. The pasta itself was good. It was homemade and perfectly cooked. The Ragu sauce, however, was very salty. It would've been perfect if the salt was reduced. The pomodoro was just very bland. \n\nWe didn't try desserts just because our starter and entrees weren't that impressive. \n\nThe best part about this restaurant was that it was conveniently located in Ponce City Market. It makes it an easy place to go if you're craving pasta.",

The shrimp comes from Savannah so it is fresh too. The tiramisu was also off the chain and I got two Night on the Ponce IPAs. Despite all of that, I don't feel stuffed and weighed down. The nice young man taking orders was more than friendly and pretty much everyone in the place was smiling.",

        "text": "One word. CARBONARA. If you're a carbonara connoisseur like myself and you're in Atlanta you've got to give this place a try. The pasta is freshly made and deliciously creamy. There's a perfect amount of flavor. I've been here many times when I have a craving for some comfort pasta and it's always been a hit. The servings aren't huge but they are the correct portion sizes. The prizes are relative to any place that makes their pasta fresh. \n\nAnd just like any other PCM restaurant there are tons of options. You can order to go. Order at the register and they'll bring it to your table. Or sit in the back for full service. \n\nAgain. I'm telling you, if you love carbonara you've got to come to this place. You won't regret it. Lastly their cocktails are delicious and perfectly crafted. If you love a good cocktail like myself - you're going to love this place.",

A great stop if you are looking for a good meal in Ponce City Market. \n\nFound myself itching for pasta while walking in PCM, so was super happy to stumble across this place!\n\nThe restaurant serves fresh pasta that both buy as a takeaway or eat while dining in. Looks like they also have a wine bar in the back if you prefer full service. Quite a few non-pasta options as well. \n\nI ordered the Ragu to split with my boyfriend, as we both weren't too hungry but wanted something to snack on before we started our night. Mentioned this briefly to the gentleman ringing us up, and to our surprise, he actually split our pasta into two small bowls! A small gesture that we both really appreciated \n\nAs for the pasta itself - loved the texture (al dente) and the meat sauce. Thought both were very solid and delicious! \n\nOverall, def a good spot that I would return to next time we stop by!",

        "text": "Absolutely amazing food, and just exceptional service. I ordered two pasta dishes tonight and completely forgot to make sure all cheeses were pasteurized (I'm 34 weeks pregnant). The staff was incredibly informed of their ingredients (one of the parmeseans is unpasteurized).  And even though they had made my dishes, they re-made me 2 different dishes, and were SO kind about it. The manager (young, beautiful woman) could not have made me feel better about the situation (I felt awful for causing problems and wasting food!) \n\nNow for the food- let me start off that I am extremely picky. Not only am I (American)-Italian, raised by a family in the i talus food business, I have a lot of experience as a chef in a high-end Italian restaurant, so needless to say I am difficult to impress and very picky when it comes to Italian food. This food is undoubtedly among the few very best in Atlanta. Every single ingredient is fresh and of the highest quality, impeccable attention to detail. Your tastebuds will thank you. Focaccia is on point, pomodoro pasta and the raviolis are insane. I cannot wait to try more dishes.  This is a true gem in Atlanta!\n\n5/5 stars! Would give them even more if I could!!!",

Loved it. \n\nSo tonight, that was my meal but I wanted something a little heartier. I chose the potatoes side. Wow. Second surprise. Loaded with flavor, topped with a little cheese and oil??

We tried the squid ink pasta (polpo) and the rapini based on the server's suggestion. Both were delicious and a tad bit spicy. You can taste that the pasta is homemade and the delicious Italian sausage is as well in the rapini.\n\nThe dishes like most food in PCM are not cheap but you get what you pay for here. I was surprised the meals didn't come with bread but they brought some delicious warm ones over when we asked at no charge. Also tried a tasty cannoli afterwards for desert. \n\nWe went on a busy Valentine's day night so it was a bit packed in there but the atmosphere was still good. Would recommend and come back for the pure quality of the food.",

        "text": "Was referred to come here after hearing rave reviews - walked in and was seated by a lovely waitress named Ariel. I wished she served us but she moved on as she was super busy, she was super nice and informative but obviously overworked and overwhelmed. We were then left to the bar keep which was a guy whom I never did learn his name but was very lackluster and did mess up our order, did not tend to our table, did not fill our drink, etc. I had to call for service the entire visit. We were starving, thirsty, and annoyed. I had high hopes for this place. I was excited at the fact they had homemade pasta made daily, the fresh bread looked amazing passing by our table - also that's another complaint. This is the first Italian restaurant I've been to that doesn't offer bread while you wait. Why is that? We were starved to say the least. You have to pay $8 for bread and olives. The bread looked better than it tasted *shrugs* anyway - my meal was good. I got the Ragu. I love the flat noodles and preferred the meat sauce which was delicious. I added straciatella cheese and it was a good choice. Gave it a creamy touch. My mothers meal was input incorrectly and when it came out they realized it was wrong and then snatched from in front of her rudely. The waiter then came over questioning what she ordered and then went to put in the correct order snd told her it would be 6 minutes. He did apologize but offered no other resolution than a dry apology and could've offered her bread or a salad while she wait as we were all eating and she was obviously hungry. He was really a sorry excuse for a server. Once her Spaghetti came out it was literally CRUNCHY. At this point we were over it. Nobody came to check on us and by the time we asked someone to come over I complained about the meal and asked them to remove it from the check, and they then offered a free dessert - in which she chose a pistachio cannoli (save your $6 - there wasn't an ounce of sugar in it) Although my Ragu wasn't half bad it was nothing to write home about. I will not return. I regret not stopping at the Cuban or taco stand around the corner.",

        "text": "Located in the Ponce City Market this Italian market & restaurant grabs you to want to check it out an dine there.  In the front the market has an assortment of fine Italian goods such as cheeses, cured meats, etc., that most of is made fresh all laid out to grab your eye.  In the back the more formal menu and seating.  \n\nOn this particular occasion I was with my sister and two nephews (4 & 2) in which we were all starved, me from just arriving in town and the kids just being kids.  Unfortunately on this day they got our order wrong in that other folks that ordered well after ours received their meal before us.  We had to ask for the bread, which we paid for,  just to keep the kids from crying. Keep in mind our orders where nothing special or particularized, mac and cheese for the kids and two orders of the Ragu w/ the slow cooked beef and pork sauce. When I received my order there was basically no sauce and asked for some sauce, which they went to get, unfortunately the wait was too long and I had to get up and go out and I grabbed myself a bagolgi bao further down. My sisters Ragu was good, but of course took way too long for a fast casual eatery.  The nephews were indifferent to the mac and cheese.  \n\nUnfortunately first impressions make a big difference and this first impression was forgettable.  I don't plan on revisiting this experience again when there are too many other exceptional options in the food market.",

        "text": "Seems like there is a trend across visitors, they come here because it has the shortest line. \n\nTo continue on the string of reviewing the overpriced nature of dining at Ponce City Market, Bellina was no exception. Are these restaurants crooks trying to drive inflation across Atlanta or is Ponce City Market just pocketing all this money? I wish somebody gave me some insight. Somebody is responsible for this nonsense.\n\nCame here on Saturday afternoon and got a sandwich with prosciutto...the sandwich was about 98% bread and about 2% prosciutto. I mean, there was basically no meat and the thing costs double the price of a sandwich anywhere else in this city! I don't understand. Oh, and as expected, when you have so much bread and so little of other ingredients, the sandwich won't taste very good. It didn't. The only things I enjoyed from this meal were the pickled vegetables and the fact that it was finally over. On top of all this, you are expected to leave a tip for the staff bringing you the sandwich and cleaning up, thus you are looking at a $15-$16 sandwich with all included. \n\nThe staff were nice, the selection of italian sodas is good and the design inside is pleasant. However, the establishment is not worth the price by any means and the food itself was disappointing.",

Ended up with an Italian sausage sandwich on ciabatta with arugula and Calabrian peppers. I was expecting it to be spicy from the peppers but it wasnt, still delicious though! My aunt raved about the chicken salad and my mom loved the prosciutto and mozzarella. The bread was fresh and the food came out very quickly. \n\nService was strange. When our server first approached, he didn't say hello or introduce himself, which led me to believe he was maybe a busser just dropping off water.  He took our order in a very robotic, unfriendly fashion and did not offer recommendations or suggestions. Being at work seemed very laborious for him and from what I could see, he was only waiting on two other tables. I ordered a flavored San Pellegrino and he brought a glass of ice with it. As he was pouring, he spilled a decent amount of the beverage on the table and my menu, and didn't apologize or excuse himself. He just walked away and left the stained menu in front of me. Not sure if he was having and off day or gates is job but he was a damper to the experience",

        "text": "Variety is the spice of life! But sometimes one really wants to enjoy a good meal and experience a part of the world without really going there. Like the Italians say \" Il dolce far niente!\"- the sweetness of doing nothing.  What better place to cultivate Dolce Far Niente.\n\nBellina Alimentari is located on the first floor of Ponce City Market. Entrances can be accessed within the market or from the outside. Great relaxing atmosphere and great service. One really can just do nothing, the waitresses and waiters make sure you don't even need to ask for a refill of water, they quickly attend to the customers with hospitality and quickness. All we had to do was focus on our moments, company, the food. And didn't have to be irritated by when the waiter is coming around or when our food is done, how can we get a refill. They're on it. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time about 20 minutes.\n\nWhat my Boyfriend and I ordered:\n\nBucatini all'amatriciana-Gragnano pasta, Spicy San Marzano tomato sauce, crispy pancetta.\nThis is a personal preference, I generally like my pasta with more sauce than not. This dish is tossed in the sauce so it just coats the spagehetti. I would've preferred more sauce and more bits of crispy pancetta! I probably only got 3 bites of them. On the other hand, the pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce had just the right amount of kick to it. If you are wondering if it is really \"spicy\" its not, its just enough. \n\nFusili al pesto- Gragnano pasta, winter pesto, ricotta cheese, toasted walnuts. Its delicious, can't say anything bad about it! Gosh, Can i bring the chef home with me?!\n\nDefinitely would love to try the other dishes there\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nAs for date nights and what not, seeing it being my first time, I'm not sure how the restaurant works or how busy it really gets.\n\nSigning off",

The meatballs were tasty but I had to order extra sauce. I don't think they simmer them in the sauce because it wouldn't stick. The Ragu was delicious, noodles were a little soft.

Also, I forgot her name but our waitress was also super nice and helpful. \n\nHowever, though the food and service were amazing as a whole, the hostess definitely fell short. Normally I wouldn't call something like this out but we definitely didn't feel welcomed by her attitude. \n\nIf you're craving good Italian food and in the midtown area, I definitely suggest this Bellina!",

        "text": "I have to give this place major props for making all their pasta homemade. You can really taste the difference. I've been to this place a couple times now and do plan on coming back in the future. Having been to Italy, it's definitely difficult to find places where I live that serve authentically good Italian food. This place does seem to put a lot of care into the quality of their food. \n\nI'd recommend the carbonara pasta, which seems to be their most popular dish. I've also had the ragu and the americiana pasta. The ragu is a little more filling, and the americiana is lighter (and reminds me of spaghetti marinara with bacon in it). I highly recommend getting a side of the potatoes to split. They're prepared very simply with some olive oil and very little cheese which elevates the taste of the potato itself without it getting drowned out in other ingredients. We also had the pane e olive (schiacciata bread served with olives (not pitted) and olive oil) which was simple but refreshingly good. \n\nThe area is really trendy which makes it fun to visit this restaurant. They have indoor and outdoor seating as well as giving you the option to order food to go or having a sit down meal. Also, the outdoor area is very dog friendly and this restaurant is no exception. The second time we went we brought our dog and had a full service meal at this place outside. \n\nThey also do pasta making classes for people at least once a week (and let you take home your creations). I've signed up for a class and will post an update afterwards. It's a little pricey so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they deliver. \n\nUPDATE - I highly recommend the pasta making course. The class was very relaxed and informative. Most of the people there were either part of a couple or with a friend, but don't let that stop you from joining. This class really is for everyone. It was taught by the restaurants executive chef, whose background and experience really took this course to a professional level. If you want to go and drink wine and make pasta, or if you're serious about picking up some additional culinary skills, this course is for you.",

And even chef pasta making classes in the back area if you plan ahead. Carbonara they said was the favorite and it was good but the squid ink dish was my most favorite. The meatballs are divine and great portion to share as an appetizer. The meat and cheese plate is perfect to snack on. The wine selection is great and well priced for bottles too.

This spot was everything!!!! Ssssssoooo happy we chose it. We sat outside, socially distanced from the other tables. Service was amazing. \nFood was very fresh and you can tell things were homemade. We started with the caprese salad. The burratta was soft and it was drizzled with a balsamic vinegarette and olive oil with a tomato garnish. \nWe had the arugula salad and they bring you fresh, soft bread with olive oil and olives on the side. \nMy  friend had a ceasar salad. The romaine lettuce was crisp, the croutons were fresh, the cheese was a good portion, and they gave you a perfect amount of dressing to cover the salad. \nI had the spaghetti pomodoro and added 7 saut√©ed shrimp. Spaghetti noodles were thick and flavored well. The sauce was not too thin or thick. Perfect consistency in the middle. \nThe other 2 women had the sangria and they said it was very good. Had hints of ginger and they give like a charred lemon for presentation. \nBefore the end of the meal, a manager came out to ask how our food and service was. We told him everything was perfect. \nPlease stop by if you want authentic Italian flavor and great service. Will definitely be back!",

Our waiter handled the awkward rudeness of my inlaws like a champ! (I wish I could have apologized to you on the side) and the bartender made this pregger woman the lemonade she was craving. I can't thank you enough!  hopefully this review meets you both! Thanks again!",

        "text": "Spent time in Atlanta for the weekend as we traveled to see the Saints play the Falcons. Our first night here, we went to Ponce City Market and grabbed a bite to eat before attending the jazz concert at City Winery. We are so glad we did. I had the Ravioli and my husband had the GA shrimp and pasta! OMG the ravioli was divine! The sauce was perfect, and the pasta was superb and you can tell it was freshly made! My husband enjoyed his meal as well. The service was ok. Well we enjoyed the food so much we went again the next night. I had the exact same ravioli, but had an appetizer of focaccia bread with olive oil and olives. The bread was freshly prepared, the olives were slightly salty but perfect accompanying to the bread. My husband ordered the Ragu the second night and he enjoyed it more than the GA shrimp. The first night I had a delicious Umbria wine and tonight (as they were out of the Umbria) I had the Soave which was actually almost as good as the Umbria. Our server was kind and very attentive. I ordered the tiramisu to go and ate it later and it was a great end to a perfect meal!",

        "text": "What to get: pasta\nService: 4/5\nAtmosphere: Casual, order at counter, eat at communal tables\nWait: 4 mins (Wednesday 7PM for 6)\n\nThe Experience:\nIt's a cute little Italian shop within PCM. Looks like a small specialty market, but they serve food here as well. You can choose to order and have it brought to one of the communal tables in front, or opt to get seated in the dining area in the back. It's kind of an elevated eatery in PCM, so you can expect a nice meal somewhere.\n\nI picked the Ragu since I love pappardelle pasta. All the pastas come in large bowls and look picturesque. I think portion-wise, it's just enough to satisfy, but not feel overly full. Just enough room for dessert.\n\nI'd come here again if I had the chance. Still so many other places in PCM to try.",

        "text": "A great option at Ponce City Market! I ordered the finocchio salad and the pomodoro pasta. Both were great, and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. They have a few house wine options to order at the counter, but I decided to order a different wine separately at their wine bar. They also had a small shopping area for Italian products. It reminded me of Eataly. The food was great and came out quickly, my only complaint would be the pasta prices for the to-go portion sizes (eat-in portions looked huge).",
