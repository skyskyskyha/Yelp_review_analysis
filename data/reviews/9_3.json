        "text": "We came to the restaurant as a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) for an early dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant was pretty much empty at this time. Nevertheless we were seated at a \"prime\" spot right by the utility room with a constant people traffic behind our backs. I could enjoy the view of mops, baskets and other such like things every 5 seconds the curtain to the utility room would open. Not a very relaxing atmosphere I should say. \nOur waiter was very unfriendly. Kids were interested in the lamps on a table.  As soon as the waiter came to our table he took the lamps out of kids' hands. He was very rude while doing this. With a cold stone face. My son nearly started crying. He could have done this more politely if these lamps are such a treasure and can't be touched. The waiter offered water. We agreed to complimentary tap water. Only three of us ended up with glasses of water. My daughter was left without a glass for God knows what reason. We were also left with just one wine glass. I don't know how much more careless a waiter can be with his guests. Haven't met such a rude, careless, unfriendly waiter in a very long time. We ended up leaving the place without making a food order. This place should make an effort and treat their guests with some respect. The only positive thing out of today's visit that I can mention is that interior design was lovely. But don't bother coming here for a nice family dinner.",

        "text": "First of all STUNNING ! I would easily say this is one of the prettiest restaurants I've eaten at in Atlanta in a while. I went there on a whim so I did it have a reservation (def get a reservation) - they were committed for the night so I sat at the bar. The win list was amazing and the bartender was great and suggested a few wines to me. I ordered the lamb chops and they were cooked and seasoned to perfection. Service was excellent. Food was great. Ambiance was perfect ! The bartender gave me a complimentary glass of champagne to end my night which was very nice - would definitely go back",

We ordered drinks and appetizers at the same time. Our appetizers arrived and we're finished before our drinks arrived. Our entrees didn't come out until 45 minutes after that. While the food was good, the portions weren't as ample as you get at other Middle Eastern restaurants in the Buckhead area for about the same price point.",

The service was good extremely friendly, helpful and needing little more experience.  The food quality was nearly perfect.  Great apps like beets, cauliflower, and grilled octopus were all very good to exceptional.  Great flavors and most certainly worth the visit.   The lamb shank did not meet the same exceptional standard.  Lamb appeared to be rushed and thus not tender.  The quality of meat seems good and flavors were good, but hidden by the cooking.   Overall there are items on this menu wanting to come back regularly.  Hopefully the lamb shank was a rare miss.  I will certainly come back as there are several other items on menu that look worthy!",

Kitchen messed up our order then tried to charge for their mistake, long waiting period after we sat down before getting served and we were 10 min early for a reservation we had for 3 weeks. For a restaurant that requires a CC to hold a ressie and is $200-300 for a two person dinner, the service should be a lot better. More frequent and attentive, to say the least.",

We were at the back end of the bar and the staff seemed to be having a frat party back there. Loud, rude. They only had one glass of Pinot Noir left for my friend, but showed us there was another ounce or two left in the bottle but refused to top her off. I had arrived at 9:30. I ordered a cocktail with Sumac tequila that was lovely. At 10pm we ordered a second round. A different bartender said \"sorry, they closed us down\". Who is they?!  When we asked why there wasn't a last call they said \"we usually stop serving at 10pm\". To which I replied:  I didn't see that sign when I came in\".  When the other bartender walked up we asked why weren't given a last call.  He rudely / begrudgingly offered to make me a drink but told my friend she couldn't have a second glass of wine because they were out of Pinot. Didn't even give her an opportunity to order a different wine.   They ambiance is nice but the service is unacceptable.",

Our waiter was excellent in his knowledge of the menu and gave us a thorough history of the restaurant as well as the owners. I don't eat rice so our waiter got me eggplant stew which was excellent. By the way he reminded me of a character from Indiana Jones Temple of Doom. He said that he is a part time actor. Our wives had a misunderstanding on who was supposed to make the reservation and realized that we didn't have one. Luckily the guy at the front desk (Kevin?) got us a table - thank you!!!

For the main course we had the sea bass- excellent. The wine list was unusual in the best way..got to try Lebanese wine and it was great.

They appear to be focused on upselling items instead of providing good customer service. Case in point : one member of my party was gluten free. Kudos for asking for allergies but big fail in attempting at all to accommodate them. We ordered the hummus which comes with pita. A GF request for something such as cucumber to dip in the hummus was denied, suggesting we order a different dish which comes with cucumber. Wrong drinks brought, total inattentive waitress (no drink refills). After 45 minutes of waiting for our mains (now almost an hour after arriving) we asked for a check. Manager comped with little else to say. Way overpriced for the level of service.",

We ordered a hummus to start off with, and for $9 the portion was extremely small and below average compared to other Lebanese restaurants. The complimentary bread, also, seemed like store bought pita. We ended up having something come up where we needed to leave in a rush and let our waiter know. He took our credit card. Rather than understanding our situation, the waiter attended other tables and closed out another table's check before ours. We only got our credit card and check 10-15 minutes later when one of my friends got up and asked our waiter. Will not try again! Ambiance was great though lol!",

From the fake Corinthian columns to the gold brass trim, Home Depot chandeliers, black velvet pillows and the occasional escort girl, you will feel you have been transported to the strip!

We waited for 20 minutes for our cocktails and we made a reservation.  The server brought us the wrong appetizers and looked at us like we were asking for the moon when we asked for the correct order. Atlanta has done it again. Another bad restaurant that will do well.

The employee walked away . This situation was unacceptable it completely ruined my husbands celebration. For the restaurant  to be semi upscale this is not the type of events that should take place here. After that incident the entire mood of the establishment changed in a negative way.

It is described on the menu as smoked eggplant, but it tasted like I was eating a cigarette. It was so bad we had to send it back. Baba Ghanoush is one of my favorite foods and I have made it many times, also charring the skin, but this was on another level. It was a HUGE disappointment. That's my only complaint, but it rates high for me since I was really looking forward to that dish. Hopefully, the chef will tweak his recipe to make it more appealing. Outside of that, the service was good and the atmosphere was great! If you like Mediterranean food, definitely check out Zakia!",

Although I put in my reservation to have a quieter table, we were told that was the only table available . I need to also note that we had an earlier reservation of 6:00pm. When we got to the restaurant,  15 minutes early at that. Only three other tables were taken. Luckily we were greated by Tyler who had this whole experience do a 180 degree turn. Me and my son had a fun memorable experience. Food and service was flawless!!! Just really wish we could've had a better table.",
