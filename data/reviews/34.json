        "text": "Great experience here! We have been to other locations but the west midtown one is the best. The staff here are just great, walking in we were greeted with energy. Nothing better than already feeling welcome. The wait staff came to check up on us even though you order through your phone it just felt like we were VIP. Ordering on the phone is hard for people who are not great with tech (me) but they helped immediately. Parking is tough they do have a public parking deck down the street that was $2 for two hours. \n\nFood wise always satisfied! We got the trio with salsas and guacamole. It didn't come with enough chips, but they brought more out! \n\nThe tacos, I always get the fried oyster you can't go wrong with it. My fiancé liked the tuna taco but wish it was on a corn or flour tortilla (maybe it can be subbed out) the birria tacos were sooooo juicy. The side sauce was more of a thick soup vs. what birria comes with typically needless to say it still had all the flavors that you would expect.",

        "text": "I came to bartaco on a beautiful sunny day. It was perfect weather to sit outdoors, but unfortunately they were busy cleaning the patio. This wasn't a big deal because the indoor seating was comfortable. Also, the operable walls were open and let in the fresh air. The ambiance is relaxed, trendy, and vibrant with a casual coastal vibe. The design of the restaurant, with its open and airy layout, creates an inviting atmosphere that is perfect for socializing and casual dining. Service was great and the waiters were all very friendly, attentive and helpful. You place your meal through QR code menu ordering, which requires you to put in your payment information. The food comes out shortly after. Below are my reviews:\n\n* Seared chorizo taco - This is an argentinian-style spiced ground pork, topped with sweet onion, cilantro and smoky red chimichurri sauce that comes on a 4-inch corn tortilla. You only get a few pieces of meat, but it is so tasty and tender. The flavor tastes even better after you squeeze a bit of lime juice on it. Definitely worth getting again!\n* Glazed pork belly taco - The pork belly is soft and tender. It is supposedly marinated in a spicy arbol chili sauce, but what I tasted was the sweet caramelized flavor of the glaze. Like the chorizo taco, this came on a corn tortilla. This was delicious, but I think I like the chorizo even more. \n* Tuna tatako taco - This is an ancho-crusted tuna with asian slaw on a bibb lettuce shell. I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this taco and the presentation. The tuna is coated in what tastes like a sweet soy sauce. The asian slaw is also well-seasoned and the flavors come together nicely. It tastes healthy and refreshing, especially after you add a few drops of lime juice. I will say that the tuna isn't super fresh, but it still tastes good.\n\n* Oaxacan sunshine - Absolutely adored this cocktail! The passion fruit flavor really hit the spot, and all the ingredients complement each other. It is so refreshing and the alcohol is not overpowering. This is a really well made cocktail and I have to learn how to make this myself because it is just that good. (Ingredients: libélula joven + gentian liqueur + orange + mint + lime + passionfruit syrup + chia + montelobos mezcal mist)\n* Spring caipirinha - This cocktail was not as impressive as the oaxacan. I expected it to taste more tart because of the elderflower, but it ended up tasting like diluted, spiked, fresh orange juice. It wasn't bad, but I would go for the oaxacan if you are looking for something citrusy/sour, that is also sweet and refreshing. (Ingredients: cachaça 51 + elderflower + orange + lime + sugar). \n\nWhile I think this place is a bit pricey considering the small portions, the food is tasty. I would love to come back and try more off the menu!",

        "text": "We come to Howell Mill location a few times a year. \n\nOne thing that is different about this restaurant is you need to place your order on the app by scanning the code affixed to the table. The servers are there only to bring the food/drinks and to clear the tables. There is no usual chattiness or attention unless you flag someone down. They have little cards that you are supposed to prop up when you need service, but no one really pays attention to those. \n\nThey also do not take reservations but if you have their app on your phone, you can add yourself to a wait list that starts ticking off 30 minutes for you to show up to the restaurant. This does not guarantee you a table though.\n\nNow to the positives: the food is good and so are the drinks. I love their brown rice bowls and the steak tacos. The salsa trio is super salty, so I won't order it since it always disappoints. The patio is nice in summer but sometimes the music is very loud and it's hard to communicate.\n\nOverall: parking may be tricky (street parking is usually hard to find but I do believe they have valet), nice patio, good food and drinks, spotty service. Your make the call ;)",

We had several tacos and they were all very good. Each has its own flavor profile which I greatly appreciate. We especially enjoyed the duck barria tacos. The duck and cheese had great flavor and the tacos were crunchy. The sauce to dunk the tacos was good. Very delicious.  \n\nWe had some of their cocktails: margarita, mojitos which were good.  \n\nOnly negative is the limited parking as there's none. You're stuck with finding parking on the street. The parking lot next door is only for those in that shopping center. \n\nIt's mobile ordering and you can have it in one receipt or per person.  Thus, make sure you have your phone and a card on file for your phone. \n\nOtherwise, it's still a great restaurant with nice ambiance.",

        "text": "My friends and I came here because it was one of the few restaurants whose kitchen was still open and we were all wanting to eat something and grab some more drinks! Coming here late night was a great choice, everyone was just trying to have a good time and the servers were all super friendly. I had the salsa verde chicken tacos and chorizo taco and we ordered chips and guac for the table. I like that for their chips they use whole tortillas! That's pretty unique. Their guac is also really flavorful and fresh. My favorite part of bartaco is the bar part of it haha, their drinks are excellent! I highly recommend the winter caipirinha, the presentation was beautiful and it was just super tasty! \nNow that I know their kitchen is open late, I think I will be coming here more often. My only complaint is the parking, there were no spots in the garage and I ended up parking in the Food Terminal Lot, which I'm not sure if I was allowed to do",

I stuck with the basics, where she went for the wilder tacos and we both enjoyed our meals!

        "text": "I've been to Bartaco a few times in the past, but I haven't been in awhile. I got a chance to dine there on Tuesday with some friends. Prior to going, I called ahead and we were able to join the waitlist. When we arrived, our table was ready and we were seated right away. Now a few things have changed since I was last there like the ordering process. They have a QR scan code on the table and everything is ordered and paid for by phone. This is definitely convenient and more COVID safe, but the way things came out, especially with a party of 9, was a little confusing. Some people ordered the same items, so it was hard to tell whose food was coming out. It would be nice if they called the name with the order, I think that would help. \n\nOur table ordered a variety of food and drink items off the menu. The guacamole and chips, Baja fish tacos, pork belly taco, Esquites (Mexican street corn off the cob), and the spiced chicken verde taco were among the favorites. We also ordered salsa roja and chips, crispy oysters and chili-lime shrimp tacos. I personally liked the crispy oysters taco. It was very flavorful and tasty. The chili-lime shrimp taco was good, but definitely super spicy. Some guests couldn't even finish it due to the spice level, so beware. For drinks, we ordered a hibiscus mezcalita, an old thymer, margaritas, and other drinks. For some reason, it took forever for some of our drinks to come out, but once we got them, the drinks were all really good!\n\nOverall, our dining experience was good with some minor kinks. However, I plan to visit again in the future and hopefully the ordering issues will be worked out. Bartaco is good spot for a quick bite to eat and drink. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area!",

The bar service was a bit chilly but it's holiday season so I'm sure they are exhausted. \n\nWe came in for drinks primarily. The sangria is delicious. It's not the strongest, but if you are looking for a light cocktail choose this one! The mojito is so sour, fresh and good! One of my favorites!\n\nI also tried the corn appetizer. It was great. Very warm and salty from the feta. You have to be a feta lover to love this appetizer! Salsa verde also is very good! All pretty small portions I must say.",

        "text": "Came in with Baby Love on a Thursday night around 9PM. Once seated, you scan the QR code on the table for the menu. First scan wouldn't let us order, only view the menu. 2nd attempt it wouldn't go through because it froze several times when it got to the credit card portion. Ended up doing a paper order after tracking a server down. Write the drinks up top and added special instructions at the bottom. \"NO DAIRY\" in all caps. \n\nFor the restaurant not to be busy, the service was really slow. We patiently wait for something ordered to come out. Our drinks are first, very delicious. I ordered a Spicy Margarita. \n\nMy salad comes next. Very good! Same for the guac and chips that finally arrived. Quite some time later, our tacos came out. Woot woot! We ordered portobello, falafel and cauliflower. Two of those needed to be altered because we requested no dairy. Just looking at them, our request was ignored. We asked the waitress to confirm, to which she replied \"they all got dairy\". Errr....so we send them back to try again. Back to the extreme wait time with this half empty restaurant. We decided to go ahead and cancel the request. Enough of the shenanigans for one night, refunded for the tacos and left. \nI've been to all of the Bartacos in the area and this is the first where the customer service was below sub par. Probably won't be back to this location.",

        "text": "Came here on a Friday evening before an activity and was SUPER excited to try the much talked about Bar Taco, unfortunately I was extremely let down..\n\nI give it 3 stars for the service and atmosphere. When I came in, there was no wait and we were seated quickly which was a pleasant surprise since I've read reviews about how busy they could get! The ambiance was nice, they were playing a little bit of Drake and Beyoncé at a comfortable level and it was nice looking at the different pictures they had on the walls. I bet it looks even nicer during the day. \n\nThe manager and another waiter stopped by several times to ask if we had any questions about the ordering process since you order via QR code. PLEASEEE remember to close out your tab at the end, because it can be very tricky to know there's a next step to close out the tab. \n\nFor a drink, I got the summer caipirinha which tasted heavily like lime but I liked it. Wasn't super strong and tasted good. \n\nTo eat, I got the Fried Oyster Tacos and Sesame Ribeye. This is where the disappointment honestly set in. When they arrived to the table, they were much smaller than expected which was fine since I wasn't starving but it kind of caught me off guard. I took one bite of the sesame ribeye taco and declined to eat the rest.. it was dry (both the taco and the meat), cold, and the sesame flavor did not rock my tastebuds with Asian flavor like I was hoping it would. That taco gets a 0/10 from me. The fried oyster taco had a better flavor.. the remoulade tasted like tartar and complimented it well and the oysters had a nice, airy batter to them. However, they were EXTREMELY chewy. I am not exaggerating when I say I was chewing each oyster for at least 10 minutes.. I was with company and didn't want to be rude and spit it out but it gave my jaw a full workout when I just wanted to enjoy my meal. For that reason, that taco gets a 4/10. My friend had the duck taco and gave it a 5/10 due to lack of flavor. \n\nOverall, the ambiance was good but I don't think I'd ever be back. The food really missed the mark for me.",

Everything is done from a QR code and it just takes so much longer to order and makes it difficult to customize orders. \n\nWe got chips and salsa, several different kinds of tacos, rice and beans, the chocolate gelato, and a beer and a margarita. \n\nThe margarita was really good and fresh and not too sweet. I also don't think it was strong but it was worth it. \n\nThe chips and salsa were interesting. The \"chips\" were round tortilla shells essentially that you had to break up yourself. Ehh. The salsa wasn't great in my opinion, it had a very smoky flavor that i wasn't a huge fan of. \n\nThe tacos were pretty good. The chicken one was the best. Shrimp one wasn't great. The fish one was pretty good. \n\nThe rice was very bland by itself but the beans were super flavorful and made the rice better once you added them in. \n\nThe chocolate gelato was great. \n\nIt was kind of expensive",

The food and drinks came out very quickly. The ability to order when we wanted was very helpful especially since we had a large group. \n\nI ordered the street corn, plantains, and 2 tacos (falafel and shrimp). All of the food was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised that the plantains were so delicious. We ended up placing a second order for more.  There were a few other items on the menu I wanted to try so I would definitely be going back.",

        "text": "We finally made it out to bartaco and it was YUM. bartaco has very very limited parking in the lot by their restaurant with maybe 4 spots. We luckily parked on the street behind bartaco and only paid ~$3 for parking for our time out at dinner and there's a little stairway right by bartaco to go back.\n\nThe atmosphere and decor of bartaco was sooooooo cute and this can definitely be a cute date night out place or a girl's night out. Even though a ton of reviews said there's normally a wait, we walked right in on a Saturday night with a good 1/3 of tables still empty. I do like bartaco's digital concept as you place your order on your phone via QR code, add items as you please, and pay from your phone as well. Just easy peasy!\n\nWe ordered:\n- Baja Fish Tacos ($2.85)\n- Spiced Chicken Verde Taco ($2.85)\n- Crispy Oyster Taco ($3.85)\n- Sesame Ribeye Taco ($3.85)\n- Glazed Pork Belly Taco ($3.85)\n- Roasted Duck Taco ($3.85)\n- Street Corn ($3) \n\nWe enjoyed all of our tacos we ordered, but they are a bit smaller than your 'average' tacos as they were more street taco sized. Normally 3 normal size tacos are enough for me, but after eating our first three we had to get another. My partner is not normally a fan of corn tortillas, but he did like these!\n\nThe Baja Fish taco had a light yet crispy batter and the fish flaked perfectly. The Spiced Chicken Verde taco I found kinda meh-average, but my partner liked this one more. The Crispy Oyster taco was super yummy as well with a nice batter, but it came with only 2 pieces of fried oysters that left some taco bare with no protein. The Sesame Ribeye taco had a heaping serving of meat with a nice umami flavor. The Glazed Pork Belly taco can also get dinged for the amount of protein inside. Lastly, we both agreed the Roasted Duck taco was a HIT. We both enjoyed this one a lot and it's my partner's favorite of the night while my favorite was the Sesame Ribeye. The Street Corn was alright, but I don't think I would get it again.\n\nAfter tax and tip, dinner for 2 people came out to be around $40 which is pretty good for a Saturday night dinner in West Midtown! We'll most definitely be back for these tacos and the ambience!",

        "text": "This was my first dine in visit after enjoying takeout a couple of weeks before.  The restaurant is located downtown but fortunately there's a parking garage with free parking almost next door.  Sunday around 1pm \nwe were seated right away and asked if it was our first time. I quickly found out why.  Things are done differently here with little to no contact between guests and servers so a tutorial from the staff the first time is very helpful.  Quests use their smartphones to scan a small QR code attached to the middle of the table that takes you to the digital menu. Then they place their orders through the site which is routed directly to the kitchen. And when done eating diners pay for their meal. If you need a server's attention you simply put the dragonfly card provided in the small metal tabletop cardholder.  \nWe started with chips and salsa roja/$3.25. It was too spicy for me so they brought out a mild salsa verde and more chips at no charge.  We also had street corn(2)/$3.50; glazed pork belly rice bowl/$9.95 and a roasted duck taco/$3.85. The food was fresh with bold flavors and very tasty.  \nI will absolutely be a repeat customer.",

Mainly because of the super long wait for every step of the process (getting a table, ordering, getting our food, getting our dessert, and even getting the check). I think it took over 2 hours total.\n\nThe tacos are extremely pricey for their portion size. The best one was probably the baja fish - lightly battered and fish was pleasantly flaky. The duck was questionable and tasted off. The sesame ribeye was decent.\n\nThe churros were not as good as Costco's churro...\n\nWill not return again.",

We then asked if we could sit at the bar and the host said \"if you can dine a seat\" We found 3 quickly!\n\nWe had the cauliflower, Baja, and shrimp tacos. All were delicious! We also had some margaritas and the house tequila cocktail. \n\nWe ordered and my drink never came out, finally we asked the bartender and she said she'd make it right away. It still took another few for it to come out but when it did it was really yummy. We also ordered a second round of tacos after our first. This round came without one taco. We told a bartender who said they'd check on it for us.\n\nWe then asked again a few minutes later and she said \"oh we can remove it since you didn't get it\" and I had to ask, like can I still get the taco haha?  \n\nOverall yummy food and drinks. Ended up being ~$200 for three people (two drinks each, 3-5 tacos each + some guacamole as a side). Staff weren't super quick and seemed frazzled so don't come if you're in a hurry.",

Thank you for reaching out and providing us with feedback from your most recent visit to our location. I apologize for the quality of the food that you received. The philosophy of our menu is to always provide fresh and flavorful options for our guest and we are incredibly disappointed that your food did not meet our standard. I would love to invite you back for a Dinner for 2 on us to make up for this experience and to show what bartaco has to offer. Please feel free to reach out to me directly at cwendt@bartaco.com to discuss further. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\n- Chris Wendt",

        "text": "Dined in (outside) on a Wednesday evening - and even then it was incredibly packed already. We seated outside which was on a cute back patio.\n\nYou order through the website that you can get to via the QR code on your table. I will say this was the least enjoyable part of my experience since it was very buggy and laggy. You have to put in your phone number to validate yourself, but the system took about 5-10 minutes to even send the code for validation. Ordering was fine, though no feedback if your order actually went through or not - you just kind of had to hope that it did. A few tacos never ended up making it to the table by the end and our poor waiter had to pester the kitchen to make them for us. There were also issues with the billing on the site: some receipts got switched around and some individual items got moved to other people's receipts. We all ended up having to get our orders billed manually via our waiter, which seems to defeat the purpose of having this online system.\n\nI will say our waiter was incredible and handled everything very well, especially amongst the chaos of the busy restaurant. Every single taco was delicious (I got the Baja Fish, Pork Belly, Mojo Pork Carnitas, Crispy Oyster, Sesame Ribeye, and the #bartacosecret Barbacoa). My favorites are for sure the crispy oyster and the pork belly! I also got a side of plantains which were great - especially the sauce that came with it - which was kind of like a ranch/mayo. Definitely get the plantains to round out your meal if you can't fill up on just tacos alone.\n\nOverall - the service was great and the food was even better. Get there early to try to beat the crowd since it's a popular place. If you don't have a lot of time, I would probably try their takeout stand, since the ordering system may take up some extra time.",

Georgia law does require the person serving the alcohol to ask for ID prior to serving a beverage to anyone that looks like they may be under 40.  (I think it may have been a compliment).  Again, I apologize for the inconvenience, but I encourage you to reach out to me if you would like to discuss further.  I can be reached at dconway@bartaco.com.

I ended up getting a variety of tacos because who doesn't live tacos and who doesn't love options?! Crispy oyster, Baja fish, sesame ribeye, and spiced chicken verde. They were all so yummy. My favorite....probably the chicken. I ended it all with churros. I wasn't as happy with those. Not as sweet as I'd like and the chocolate dipping sauce wasn't my thing. I thought I'd enjoy more.

The margaritas here are awesome as well. \n\nThe service this visit was not the best. There was no host at the post , we waited about five minutes before someone approached our party. The food took a long time to come out once ordered. \n\nThe ambience here is good, we sat out on the patio, equipped with heaters if the temperature drops. We parked at a nearby garage (free). \n\nI love bartaco's food ; however, the service made it a leas desirable experience.",
