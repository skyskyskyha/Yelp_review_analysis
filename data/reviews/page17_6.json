It's just that FRESH AND DELICIOUS. If I order pick up, it's always ready and I don't have to get out of my car. If I order an alcoholic beverage...I don't have to search for the alcohol....ijs.

For our entrees, we had the Lobster roll and it was nothing short of sexual. I will definitely be back! I also had a Gingerita that was tasty but not quite strong enough for me.

Our waiter, James, was great and very attentive. The manager was very kind and attentive as well. I ordered the blackened scallops with jasmine rice & broccoli. The scallops were very large and the serving size given was large. I believe there were 7-8 scallops which is much more than most restaurants give. They were really good. I would highly recommend the scallops. I tasted my mom's sweet potato tater tots and they tasted very good. Great side. My friend and mom both got the trout and said it was good. Everyone really enjoyed their meal. The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice & the staff is taking precautions for safety and COVID. I would recommend this restaurant if you want a nice seafood meal with exceptional service.",

I find the fish to be fresh here, as this is also a fish market. Friendly staff always make us feel welcome. They are kind enough to cook a plain chicken fillet, and always have a ready water bowl for Avrora. I have had their salmon and catfish, and enjoyed them both. Their greens are nicely seasoned. And, their desserts are tasty. Don't sleep on their cocktails. You'll enjoy them. I'll be returning soon.",

        "text": "Service terrible. No where near capacity  in the restaurant. I walked in and asked for seating for 1. I was not asked if I had an preference for inside or outside dining. I was walked to the backside of the bar by the kitchen door.   Absolutely not for me. I then asked if there was any availability outside.  The manager/ host looked around as though he was going to choose a table and then said to me \"pick wherever you like. I choose my table. After a few minutes the bartender came to my table and informs me that he will be my server. I found this odd as there were only 2 additional parties seated outside.  Another party was seated 1 table away and was provided with a waiter. As the manager was leaving after seating the table that was 1 table away, I asked if he could send the bartender to take my order.  He then said he would take my order.  He returns with my drink and says that my order has been placed. I feel that I was treated less than because I was a Black  female dining alone. All of the other patrons where Caucasian and provided standard service. As I paid my check I asked the bartender how many tables he had outside. His answer confirmed my thoughts. I was the only table being served by the bartender. This is 2022. THIS ESTABLISHMENT MUST DO BETTER!  To add insult to injury, someone took it upon themselves to fill out my satisfaction card. Their comments did not reflect my experience (see attached) and I did not leave this false representation of my experience. I ordered wine and the lobster roll. Everything was good but the lobster roll was small for $29",

Everything was prepared really well and tasted great.  My favorites are the fish sandwiches and fish tacos.  The slaw and fries are good too.\n2) The modular menu.  You can pick any fish and have it prepared how you want: fried, blackened, grilled, sautÃ©ed + Served how you want: Taco, Sandwich, Plate with sides, Salad.  This is really great and I wish more places did it this way.\n3) They are fairly quick with takeout.\n4) Good service\n\nWhy not 5 Stars?\nThere is some variability in the kitchen.  Sometimes the fish may come out a little overcooked.  It's not bad, but not always perfect.",

The food was underwhelming to say the least. I had to ask the waitress if they accidentally forgot to season any of the food. The only flavor was from the char marks from the grill.

You can imagine how restless & hungry our 3.5 year old & 1.5 year old kids were...\n\nDishes we ordered:\n1. Blackened Snapper sandwich: tasty & fish was cooked well.\n2. Creamy Scallop pasta: scallops were cooked well but plain & not seared well. You get 5 good-sized ones. Linguine was al dente. Lemon butter parmesan sauce was soupy & filled up to the brim of the bowl.\n3. Grilled Salmon plate: cooked well (medium) but was this salmon fillet for a child? TINY serving.\n4. Kid's fish nuggets: pretty tasty & not super oily\n\nKitchen service/speed needs to greatly improve before we return. We received 3 free coupon for apps & may not even use them to be honest...",

Simple decor and high ceilings, and we grabbed a table over by the bar. \n\nThe fritters were a winner for the app. Sometimes there's an extra fish on the menu depending on what looked good coming in that day. The blackened mahi was just spicy enough with the seasoning and well-cooked. The mac & cheese has so much competition in this city that it was good, but not a best of contender! The cilantro lime rice was definitely lime-y which we like.\n\nNice server, and it was quiet around 8:30 on a weekday. The options of sandwich/salad/plate make it a spot I'll return to when in the area. Prices are pretty reasonable, even for what's too much to pay for a Coke or tea anywhere these days!\n\nNice addition to the complex.",

Very crisp and clean decor. When I walked in I was great by a handsome sweet guy named Tommy and he actually was our server and bartender as well. We started with the shrimp and grits fritters, how is something to small filled with flavor and absolutely yummy!!! My friend had the salmon BLT and she said it was too die for and I ordered the Lobster roll, man oh man was it perfect and over filled with lobster that was yummy and perfect!! For dessert we has the Peanut Butter Pie and lawd have mercy on your taste buds!!! It was perfect. Tommy was absolutely amazing and so friendly and he made killer drink!! I don't remember the name of my drink exactly but I think it was French 75 but made with vodka and it was divine!!! I will definitely return again and again!!!",

The batter is nice and light and the fish is a thick chunk with no dripping grease.. The shape is a little unusual- a rectangle that slightly resembles a frozen French toast stick but thicker and fresh.  The old bay fries were not over seasoned, just the perfect hint of spice. Service is excellent. Parking is easy. COVID practices in place.",

My sandwich was fine but my wife's pasta dish was swimming in Alfredo sauce soup. It lacked any sense of finesse. Waiter was incredibly flustered the whole time but you could tell was trying. Kitchen service was just horrible. And walking into the restaurant smelled fishy. \n\nWill not be returning until the next restaurant opens. \n\nAs much as I'd like for a consistent local spot to win, I'd give it a year tops.

After reviewing the situation, we realized your server did not put your order into the system on time.  The kitchen did nothing wrong.  That is certainly still our fault and we fixed that issue right after reading both of your reviews.   Also, spoke with the Chef about our pasta having too much sauce and we fixed it. Next time, if anything happens, please let our managers know so that we can do our best to make it right while you are dining with us.

Good selection of local craft draft beers and the blackened cod sandwich was spot on!  And those Old Bay seasoned fries were killer.  I also learned why they do not serve a grouper sandwich and that is due to price per pound.  Fine by me if you can serve a fresh cod fish sandwhich that is 5 oz for around $13. I'm all in!!!!\n\nNOW THE DOWNSIDE....NO WIFI!  As we are on the eve of 2020, to tell me they can't have customer WIFI because credit cards are tied to the system is just plane wrong.  This is a spot to bring in your laptop, sit at the bar, do a little work and eat some good food and drink a beer or two!\n\nYou guys need a new tech company handling your IT asap!\n\nLet me know when you have it fixed and I will be back regularly.",

I've gotten take out for lunch from Big Bs before, which was fresh and delish, but have not had the chance to dine in yet. The wine/beer/liquor selection is great and always changing. Their new GM mentioned to us that if we have any recommendations to let him know and he'd get our beer on the menu. How nice is that? \n\nHave a feeling spring/summer here is going to be a big hit with their garage doors that open to the patio, and I know I'm personally looking forward to It. Hoping to keep this cute spot around for a while, so we have something other than mexican food in Chastain park!",

We stopped here for a quick family meal during lunch time and the restaurant wasn't crowded which was good for us. The host was also the only server who created us at the door and let us pick our seats. He was prompt with taking our food and drinks order and everything also came out fairly quickly. We had the calamari for appetizer and the fried fish sandwich with fries and the shrimp & grits for lunch. The calamari was tender and nicely seasoned and good overall. The fish sandwich was not bad but the fries were probably the best part of it. The one regret was the shrimp & grits which was underwhelming and left more to be desired. The grits could've been creamier/richer and thicker. All in all it wasn't a bad experience for a quick lunch but not sure we'll be back.",

Parking was a little tight, but hey it's free in Atlanta.  We both had the Fish n' Shrimp.  The battered fish was amazing.  The battered shrimp was crispy and tasty.  Their tartar sauce and cocktail sauce were both fresh and tangy.  (I think they were both made fresh on-site).  She had the traditional sides, fries, and coleslaw.  I substituted the fries for sweet potato tots.  The sweet potato tots were very tasty, I will order them again.  We both felt the coleslaw was a little bland, but we added some salt and pepper and still ate it.  She requested some pickled onions and stirred them into her slaw.  The service was top-notch for a Friday lunch rush.   The server/bartender took great care of us and did not seem rushed.  The only negative we had was the malt vinegar bottle was sticky to the touch, but that won't prevent us from going again.",
