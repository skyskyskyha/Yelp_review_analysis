Lovely restaurant, great atmosphere friendly and efficient service, and most importantly, great food! \nWell socially distanced, so very at ease. The sun dried tomato dipping sauce for the bread was wonderful, as was the dumpling and my entree, the charred salmon with rice and spinach. My friends chicken kabob was good, but on the dry side, but great flavor. They also had no problem making a great \"MOCKTAIL\" for me as i am doing \"dry January\". Look forward to going back , or getting pick up.",

Then we shared a mixed grill plate that allowed us to sample the different kebabs. I personally prefer chicken and thought the chicken kebabs were really good, especially with the sauces that came with it. My boyfriend prefers beef and lamb, and he really enjoyed the different options. The only issue with our meal and that of a friend was that we had asked for our beef to be cooked medium and we both got rare. For that reason, I didn't even try the beef, but my boyfriend still thought it was good. That issue aside, we enjoyed our experience and would return on our own in the future.",

Ample serving sizes so we had leftovers to take home. Our server was so kind and attentive. When we went there was free parking. But I believe paid parking starts at 5:30.

        "text": "Ok, this was not the best experience but I really hate that I have to give this place a bad review. Firstly, we wanted to be seated outside, and we were. BUT, it appeared that there were a few tables added to the outdoor area and it was in a dark corridor with one florescent light (picture included). We waited an hour at our table before I flagged down the 'manager' to check on our meal. To be fair to him, he did a great job cleaning up several messes the staff were making but the service was just not good. We started with the '3 mix the spreads' with hummus, muhammara and tabbouleh. Very good spreads, I would definitely order it again. For the mains, we had the grilled salmon and the shrimp kabobs. Very good food, but it took over an hour to receive. I would definitely order to go but the service here is just really bad. And then, to insult to injury, a bus boy came by. He set his tray on the table, requiring us to put our plates on his tray. He then preceded on to another table and gathers up a full tray of plates and such. He then requested that one of us, get out of our seat and open the door for him with his tray of plates.. I was literally beside myself... let me say again that the food was great and the manager tried to make up for his staff's shortfalls but it was not a place I would go to sit again until the service has improved.",

Understandable considering they were busy, but still, organization is key when serving tables. Overall I would recommend this place! But just enjoy yourself and the food since it's so good. These are weird times so patience is key when dining anywhere :)",

If your restaurant is going to rush people close to closing then don't seat people 30 minutes- 45 minutes before closing. We also faced microaggressions at this restaurant from the staff!

We found Truva's pretty little patio and sat outside. The bartender was waiting tables today and came to our table and made sure his mask was on. My mother is not only immune compromised, but has severely cognitively declined, but the waiter was aware, helpful, and his demeanor was kind. Even just a little kindness right now from a stranger is priceless to her because she is at home almost every day, lonely, and cannot go to her regular adult day care center with people she knows. My Moussaka, her Shrimp kabob, and our desert was perfect and delicious but the service was outstanding. Thankyou.",

Now, it seems, we'll have to always have some on hand at home because it is delicious af.\n\nSaving the 5th star for when we can actually dine-in and enjoy all the beautiful tile-work.

        "text": "Tried Truva based off a friends recommendation. Was looking for something different so thought it would be a good try. The food was good and the drinks were good. However, the service was ridiculous. Waiter kept pushing us to order. We ordered drinks and 3 of the dips. He then took our dinner order before the dips came out. We never saw him again except for when he brought the food. He dropped it on the table, and walked away. We never got a chance to order another drink or were even checked on by anyone. Thankfully, we had water or else it would have been really bad. When we finished, it still took 20+ minutes before the waiter came back. Again, food was good. Not sure we will go back as it seems like the service is a risk. If you have good service, might be worth it.",

The decorations are top notch; they are clean, perfectly themed, and comfortable. They have indoor and outdoor seating  as well as a bar. \n\nTheir happy hour starts at 3pm and is a great deal. They have discounted small plates, beer/wine, and cocktails. \n\nI had the hummus and falafel and they were so good. I even ordered a second order of falafel it was soo good. The kunefe for dessert was the perfect ending of a great meal. \n\nThe service was also super great. The server, Juliet, was attentive without being annoying and had great explanations for all of the dishes. \n\nI highly recommend this place if you're looking for something fun and different!",

Tried several things including the dumplings, cilantro rice, zucchini pancakes, falafel, and calamari. Everything was pretty good, although the pasta used in the dumplings was very dough-y, the meat filling was beautifully seasoned. I'm guessing that as things go forward, they'll work out some\nof the kinks. Def worth giving a try and providing feedback to help them do it.",

Showed up for dinner (on time) and was told there would be a 45 minute wait for our table... so, what's the point of making reservations??? Ended up eating at the bar. Bar staff was excellent and the food was good,  but I won't be going back anytime soon.\n\n\n\nFirst time here since American Roadhouse closed. New ambiance is really nice - looks totally different. Dinner experience was excellent - great service and very friendly. Recommend starting with the Turkish Mar Tea-Ni.\n\nThe food was excellent - had a number of appetizers - my favorite was the octopus. The lamb kebab was the favorite entree for our party.\n\nThe only thing I would mention in terms of opportunities to improve was that the food came out a little slow - but it wasn't a big deal.\n\nLastly, the portions are really generous - so I'd recommend splitting appetizers and/or entree's.",

All dishes were delicious with everyone taking a \"doggie bag\" home with us because the plates were hearty!   Wine and martinis were delish as well.  We sat outside with social distancing practiced and the service was excellent, especially our server Juliet.  She has a personality that needs to be replicated in so many other restaurants.  Definitely a place to remember and visit again.",
