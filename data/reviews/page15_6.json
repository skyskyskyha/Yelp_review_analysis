        "text": "We originally planned to eat at a restaurant across the street from Ameer's but it was closed so we came here instead! I'm very glad we came here because it was delicious! I didn't really know anything about it except for the good Yelp reviews (I deeply trust my fellow Yelpers). The restaurant itself is a bit plain. There's not much in it or decoration for that matter. You order at the front register and someone brings the food to your table. During lunch they also have a lunch buffet until 2pm but we missed the cut. \n\nI had the falafel sandwich which came with homemade French fries. I had no idea it came with fries until it arrived in front of me and it was a pleasant surprise indeed. The only thing I didn't like was if you want any sauce on the side or extra sauce, they will charge you $1.50. The falafel sandwich needed more sauce as it originally comes with tahini sauce and hummus but not enough of it. The falafel balls themselves were amazing! They weren't too hard or too soft. The homemade fries were really good and seasoned well. \n\nThis restaurant is good for groups of all sizes and has lots of healthy options as well!",

The rice isn't bland like other places. I would expect a tabouleh salad but this one worked out nice. Fresh tasting. Crunchy and just the right amount of lemon juice and spices. I even got hooked up with free and extra dessert. I'm part Lebanese and haven't ever tried this middle eastern pudding. Signing off as I'm now entering a food coma. I'll definitely be back with my friends ! Thank you Ameers!\nReasonable prices. (Got 2 meals out of 1 as portions are big )",

        "text": "Fairly standard halal offerings located off Briarcliff, across from Thai Chili and Sushi Itto. There isn't much by way of decor, save for two lovely wall murals. The menu is extensive but I typically opt for falafel at any Mediterranean / Middle Eastern joint so I can try a bite of everything. The Falafel Plate ($13) comes with a really nice variety: hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, Turkish salad, hot sauce, cabbage salad, and Lebanese salad. I elected to add a side of beet salad (and it was my favorite thing on the plate!). \n\nMy boyfriend tried both the falafel sandwich ($7) and the chicken schawarma sandwich ($8). All the sandwiches come with a side of fries, and both of these were served on soft fresh pita. He devoured both entire sandwiches before I could try them but that seems like a promising recommendation in and of itself. \n\nWe also had the housemade labani, which was especially good on the French fries, and the foul modamas (essentially the Middle Eastern version of refried beans). I think it's an acquired taste but I really liked the labani. The foul modamas was just OK; I probably wouldn't order it again. \n\nIf you're considering eating here, I recommend that you look at the menu on the restaurant's website as it shows pictures of every item (http://www.ameersmediterranean.com/menu/).",

Its's located in a mini strip mall next to Marcos Pizza. Easy to miss! \n\nThere was plenty of staff on hand (Counter service). They were very quick, polite & gracious with my order.  The Dining room has 2 sections. The right side has a small dining area with the Counter service & Kitchen. To the left is a spacious dining area with 2, 4 tops & booth seating. There's a flat screen tv for those dining in. \n\nI ordered take out; \nChicken kebab sandwich\nSampler: Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Stuffed Grape leaves, Falafel. \n\nEverything was delicious. The Falafel was crisp on the outside with a fluffy flavorful interior. The Hummus & Baba Ganoush were excellent. The BG was particularly good. The pita was soft & warm. The chicken kebab was moist & perfectly spiced. Steak Fries were cooked perfectly & had a hint of seasoning on them. \n\nThe Owner was particularly kind & asked if I was a new customer. He expressed his hope that the meal would be to my satisfaction & that I would return. Fabulous customer service! \n\nI will DEFINITELY returning. \nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND Ameer's for YUMMY Mediterranean cuisine.",

After coming to Ameer's I felt right at home with the smell of fresh baked bread and the friendliness of the staff. I ordered the vegetarian platter and was not disappointed. The falafel and baba ganoush were really good!! I personally was not a fan of the hummus and \"cabbage salad\" (whatever that it) but besides that I enjoyed my meal. My friends ordered shawarma platters and those were good as well! My favorite thing about this restaurant was how friendly the staff were. They all spoke arabic and loved helping everyone choose what to order!\n\nIf you want good arabic food for a fair price, come to Ameer's!",

        "text": "A great place to get a large helping of decent Mediterranean food (kababs, shawarma, falafel) in northeast Atlanta.  Ameer's Mediterranean Grill is located next to Waikikie Hawaiian Barbecue near the corner of Briarcliff Road and LaVista Road.  The street is jammed with traffic during rush hour, so it may be better to go later (after 7) if you want to visit on a weekday.  Parking spaces are limited in front of the restaurant, so I'd recommend carpooling.\n\nHighlights: Very big plates of yummy Mediterranean food.  If you don't want that much food, you can grab a sandwich for less than $10.  The sandwiches are medium to large sized and come with a medium sized portion of steak fries.  I ordered a chicken shawarma platter, which included a helping of shredded chicken on a bed of rice, a spoonful of hummus, and a side of Mediterranean salad (cucumber, tomatoes, onions) on a leaf of lettuce.  There's also pita bread served on the side.  The hummus is creamy and well balanced with respect to garlic and lemon flavor.  The rice had a nice blend of seasoning.  My chicken shawarma platter cost  a little over $12 after tax.  The other meat and seafood platters are similarly priced.  If you want combinations (for example shawarma+ falafel, kabab + falafel), these specials are on display by the ordering counter and priced around around $15.\n\nCritiques: The chicken shawarma wasn't bad, but I thought it could be juicier - maybe better served as larger chunks?   Food here is very good, just not quite 5 star Mediterranean food in my opinion.  Dining atmosphere is so-so - I'd recommend this restaurant more for takeout than dining in.\n\nOverall: I'd recommend Ameer's for takeout if you're hungry and want a large Mediterranean platter of good to very good quality.",

Falafel app, baba ganoush, beet salad, falafel plate, chicken shawarma and the lamb shank. \n\nYes....a lot of food for 2 people but we ate it for Thursday dinner, Friday dinner and Saturday lunch. So delicious! We usually hate beets but the beet salad was not earthy-tasting at all; one of my favorite salads now! I don't eat lamb but my other half said the lamb shank was amazing. \n\nAnd seriously...he did not believe me when I told him the price of the lamb shank! \n\nOnly issue was they didn't put any pita bread for the baba ganoush. But it was okay, we just dipped the falafel in the baba and also used the pita that came with the other dishes.\n\nI can't wait to go to the actual restaurant to eat someday!!",

We ordered for two; one falafel sandwich and combo #1. Unfortunately dine in wasn't available due to CoVid. We brought the food home and it was nicely packed so nothing would leak .\nAs soon as we opened our dishes we could smell the aromas of different spices. My wife had the falafel which was nicely cooked all the way through with great flavor. The pita was on the thicker side but went well with the sandwich. The fries were average but tasted great with the side of tzaziki  sauce we ordered \nI had the lamb and chicken gyro platter that came with hummus and side salad and rice. This was definitely a meal for two in it self. The meats were well prepared. I'm looking forward to my lunch tomorrow . The place was also not too expensive, you get what you pay for .",

So why is it not five stars?\nWell I had to get there myself and decide. \n\nYes the location was easy to find in Druid Hills suburb at north Atlanta. Clean store. Nice guys behind the counter took our orders and delivered to our table. \n\nLamb kebabs were grilled to perfection. They came in two skewers on a bed of flavorful rice and one of the best chopped salads found anywhere. Then in the middle of all this goodness is a splat of hummus drizzled in the best olive oil available for commoners anywhere. \n\nThe shawerma sandwiches were huge and well filled. Both chicken or beef were big enough for a second meal so make sure you get a bag of the great pita bread to re-assemble the leftovers. \n\nAll the above could have secured the five stars if the baklawa desert had a little more dough to it. Instead it was kind of nut mix with a couple of filo sheets wrapping.\nThis could be argued as an intentional style of desert but to top that with a pepsi machine that only dispenses ice and gatorade. This cannot be forgiven even though we are in Atlanta where coke dominates even the air people breath. So five stars it is. \n\nA place worth a visit and a revisit.",

The chicken is the best part, so juicy and flavorful. I got extra falafel because it is so amazing! I also ordered the kibbeh appetizer and it was really good as well. I can't wait to come back and try something else!!!***\n\nWhile looking for a place to eat since I suddenly had several hours to do nothing, I found this gem with good reviews. Middle Eastern food is my favorite, plus they had a free appetizer offer, so I figured it was a winning idea. I went in and got my free appetizer of fatayer and a combo meal with beef and lamb shawarma, chicken kabob, falafel, Lebanese salad, rice, hummus, and pita, which also came with a soft drink. Everything was absolutely delicious!! The shawarma was juicy, the chicken was spiced perfectly, the falafel was probably the best I've ever had, and the rice wasn't too buttery. All for under $13 with tax and the free appetizer. I will most definitely be back!!",

He said No problem I can make that. It was quick. Came back handed me my order. He ask first time. I explained yes, I actually don't live out here; I found you on Yelp. He said awesome don't forget us. Never. Very clean place I may add. \nGot in the car and took a bite. Best I've ever had. The only thing that got me was the pickle/relish. (hate them) yuck.

Maybe the prices are a bit high for what you get (like the appetizer salads are $6), but overall the prices are not as expensive as rumi's kitchen.  The food quality was awesome, very delicious. Recommend the labini and Lebanese salad. Falafel is excellent.",

They nail it.\n\nHere's what I usually get:\n-Beef and lamb shawarma plate (comes with rice, tomato+cucumber salad, rice, tahini sauce, and a pita)\n-Baba ghanoush \n\nThe plate: A+ . The beef and lamb is perfectly spiced, the rice is cooked but not mushy, and the hummus + warm pita is to die for. \n\nThe baba: A+. It's smoky, it's salted just enough, it's my favorite baba ghanoush in Atlanta thus far. \n\nI also want to point out the pita: Order extra. It's freshly made, and they're perfectly soft pillows of carby goodness. \n\nThe portions are also huge! This order lasts me through lunch, dinner, and a late night snack. :)",
