Beef cheeks, sea bass or pineapple chicken were delicious.   The signature cocktails were also very tasty.  The only thing negative is they put to much ice in the cocktails for the way I like them.",

        "text": "Chai Yo, is a visual delight, from its artfully crafted decor to its very beautifully presented food. A nice addition to the Atlanta restaurant scene in this regard. Starting with cocktails, they are excellent. Infusing Pandan flavor into different drinks is a surprising addition. However, the food isn't as good, probably because a bit too modified to suit the American palette  - too sweet, under seasoned, and unimpressive for anything Thai.  We had the tapioca dumplings for appetizer, which were quite nice, but each one had different consistency in spice levels and amount of filling. The basil rolls are nice, but I have had nicer ones on Buford highway. The sea bass with crab meat fried rice, lacked any seasoning and you start to wonder why is the sea bass just pan fried and nothing more added. Pineapple chicken was just too sweet. Thai lava cake, i.e chocolate cake with pandan ice cream was good. \n\nOverall, we went to Chai Yo expecting an equal or better experience than their sister restaurant Nan. But, Chai Yo ended up being an overly expensive Tuk Tuk, that stands out for its ambience, but is beaten in taste by its neighbors Tamsung and Bangkok Station.",

        "text": "Never go here! First off on a Friday night they were understaffed at the bar. Basically had to wait 30 minutes once seated for a cocktail. Secondly,  arrive 30 minutes before last call for food and of course due to ridiculous Covid restrictions much of the seating was outside. Dining there myself I requested to sit at a small table, two top, and they said oh no we can't sit you there we're bringing those tables in. Really it's supposed upscale establishment you tell a customer they can't sit at a two top table? Instead, \n they sent me a four top, Very large, awkward and inappropriate. Food was mediocre at best! Just ordered a couple appetizers and left. Good riddance!",

Our waitress was so attentive and made sure our experience was top notch. I ordered filet mignon as my entree and I got it medium well. Usually when  I go places, they can't seem to get that cook right.  It's either still too much pink or burnt. At Chai  Yo, the cook on it was PERFECT! My husband and I have already decided that we will definitely be coming back to try their everyday menu  and we can't  wait.  The ambience was great and the restaurant was super clean. The only reason I gave them a four because the seating wasn't the most comfortable.",

        "text": "The food was OK but not great. The service was just bad. Considering that the place was empty on a Friday night I dont understand why we seldom saw our waiter. We arrived at 6:15 and it took 20 minutes to make a drink order. It wasn't until 7 that we were able to order our entrees. In fact the waiter only started to check on us after I left the restaurant to walk around and see if Umi had any openings. Interesting that it takes 45 minutes to take our order, but the food is delivered 5 minutes later.\n\nThe lobster soup was pretty good. The crispy duck over noodles had a nice sauce but the duck was not crispy at all. The skin was a little rubbery. The beef cheek panang came out luke warm at best. My wife sent it back and asked if they could just warm it up. It took forever just to reheat a dish. However it did taste really good once it was warm. \n\nThe meal would be one of the priciest Thai meal we have had. I expected it would be due to location and what their menu is attempting. It was also one of the worst with regards to service and meal quality. Considering how empty it was on a Friday night I think Chai Yo may be in trouble.",

Our waitress had great food and beverage recommendations which was helpful because my wife does not like meat.  A lot of meals can have meat switched for delicious organic tofu so this .  The veggie spring rolls are delicious!  I had the garlic grouper which was also fantastic!  My wife had the drunken noodles with tofu and that was delicious too!   I also highly recommend the brussel sprouts which were really tasty and perfectly cooked so that they were tender but not mushy.  The old fashion was also tasty!

Naan, the same owner, was our prior favorite but this is closer to home and on the same level of deliciousness as Naan (I cant decide which I like better)\nEverything we tried was cooked to perfection, never overly sweet or salty-the spring rolls were extra crisp and the dumplings were soft and flavorful but not soggy--the pad Thai, delicious with perfectly thin angel hair noodles that weren't clumped or too sweet--and the lamb chops and sea bass, OUT OF THIS WORLD! If you LOVE Thai food like we do, and you're into hip, sexy restaurants with food that makes your taste buds dance, this is THE PLACE.  My kids, who are huge foodies too, said this was their favorite restaurant (and we've spoiled them with the best restaurants NYC, San Diego, Miami, and the ATL has to offer). The service was exceptional, May and the staff were so customer oriented, we wished they work for us!!",

It's overpriced Thai food but what can you do... this America and Buckhead so it is what it is\nWe got some appetizers which were legit and then shared the sea bass and the lobster khao soi...\nI've had better khao soi and really wanted to try this bc I'm a huge khao soi fan but it's hard to find on a lot of Thai menus in the us.. anyway that shit was $45 and for it to be $45 it was too refined and too ... not khao soi. I've had better fa sho. But it was decent. I wouldn't get it again. I'd get that sea bass again though for sure. I'd give this 5 star but that khao soi.... knocked it down.\nService was so great as well. Whoever the host was, salt n pepper hair dude, was so attentive and nice. Everyone was nice af. 5 stars for service even tho I had come back once more and service was  a 2 but look like homeboy was mad so I won't take it personally but nah mean 4 for food but khao soi was a 3 so ima say 4 overall.

Even after we asked for a minute to look over the dessert menu, one of the chefs came right behind her to ask for our order. For $250 for a Thai dinner for 4, sitting for an hour and a half is not beyond reasonable.",

One of my favorite Thai restaurants, Tamarind, has been under renovation so I found out this is one of the restaurants they own. The decor is really nice and elegant and the staff are very polite and welcoming. Their menu is limited and I didn't see any of my favorite Thai dishes. I understand they're located in buckhead so I expected them to be a bit pricy. Now I don't mind paying that price for good quality food, but unfortunately I was disappointed. I felt that the dishes were not as good as the other two Thai restaurants they own. My pineapple chicken was super sweet  and my husbands pad Thai was pretty bland. I guess I'm use to  authentic Thai cuisine and this restaurant had their own twist to it, which is fine, but I prefer the real deal when it comes to Thai food. If you like Thai with a modern twist then Chai Yo Modern Thai might be up your alley.",

        "text": "When I think of the Thai cuisine scene in Atlanta, the first ones that come to mind are Tamarind, Nan, And Tuk Tuk - at least from a fine dining perspective. They are all owned by the same group and when Tamarind closed down to make way for some much needed renovations at the Colony Square, Chai Yo popped up in its place but a few miles north in Buckhead. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the hostesses with warm smiles and gorgeous decor and I give them a 5/5 stars for that. The service is also friendly and the waitress was very knowledgeable and pleasant - also 5/5 stars here. \nHowever, I was taken aback by the food. This restaurant could not be further from anything Thai I have tried and been accustomed to. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was lacking in flavor. My wife was all excited about getting her favorite dish - Chicken Panang, but was disappointed that they only offered 2 options - Beef Cheeks Panang & Chicken Green Curry. Not wanting to take any chance, she ordered the pineapple chicken and that was also lacking in flavor and super sweet to the point of being a dessert. And to top it all off, their dishes were pricey but that is expected from any fine dining restaurant in Buckhead. In retrospect, should have walked 100 yards further and indulged in sushi.",

For entrees, my husband had the lobster dish with side of fried rice and I had the pad thai. I thought we were going to share food with one another but I love my pad Thai so much and he loved his so much that we just scratched that idea lol. I thought I was completely stuffed after my entree, but then my husband ordered the Thai lava cake and coffee ice cream. Man oh man.... forget the stuffedness... the coconut ice cream, the whipped cream and the chocolate cake was divineeee. I had to divulge with no regrets.

We made reservations and were seated in the first part of the restaurant near a window. The food menu is a one-pager, so there are not too many options. They are lenient with substitutions, so the staff will accommodate to your needs if you have dietary restrictions. We started with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and some beverages. The main courses we selected were the Khew Wan Kai (green curry chicken) and the Pad Thai (substitute chicken for prawns). The presentation for the starter was appealing, and the egg crepe base layer for the pad thai was a nice touch. I was not too impressed with the green curry presentation. As for the taste, I would say that the chicken used in the starter was the most savory by far. The other two dishes were nothing to write home about. I have had much better at other Thai establishments around the city. If you plan on visiting here, I would not recommend the dishes that we had. What you can enjoy when you visit is the ambiance and service. Side note: valet parking only, costs $2 + gratuity so be sure to bring cash.",

My wife had the pad Thai ($28 for pad Thai) and I had sea bass ($42 for a small portion of sea bass over rice and bok choy). One drink for me and no dessert. \nSo one shared appetizer, one drink, two entrees = $120 dinner. \n\nThe food was good but not great. We won't be back!",

They import everything in from Thailand.  The staff is super attentive and friendly.....and I mean entire staff.  Hostess, general manager, head chef/owner, and bartender.  Since I was eating solo I took a spot at the bar and like the food, the cocktails did not disappoint either.  They are located in the same square as Seasons 52, Umi, King, etc.  If you want to do a tester first, go for lunch because they have a $15 lunch box special that lets you sample multiple items off their menu for a very cheap price that will absolutely fill you up.",

For the past twenty years myself and my family have prided ourselves on providing an exceptional customer experience at our restaurants; however, we obviously failed during your recent visit.

        "text": "Super pretentious and overrated restaurant. My wife and I went in during the opening week of the restaurant and I was wearing my esports team bomber jacket since it was chilly outside. Went in and the decoration was nice and fancy, but it was chilly inside as well. As we sat down, I believe it was the maitre D asked me to remove my jacket since they are an upscale restaurant. I looked around and there was maybe two tables occupied with customers at the time... I said I'd prefer to keep it on since it was kind of chilly... couple minutes later he came back and said that they'd prefer me to remove my jacket as it was their opening week and they want to keep an upscale image. Keep in mind that my jacket was nothing out of the ordinary and it looked more like a sport coat than a bomber jacket. Anyway my wife and I decided to just listen to them and order the food. The food was terrible in comparison to any other Thai restaurant you ever go to.... my wife ordered the pad Thai that said it had jumbo shrimps... the entree came and there were no shrimps to be seen.... we had to send it back...Then the bill came and it was extremely overpriced.... I would not recommend any asian food lovers or any food lovers in general to visit this restaurant ever... it is pretentious, overpriced, overrated, and last but not least the food was not even up to par with a Thai takeout restaurant.",

The cocktails were innovative and refreshing, the appetizers (the star being the Lobster Tom Kha Soup- savory lobster coconut soup) were delicious and our entrees were incredible. We ordered the Pork Belly, Pad Kee Mow and Seabass Garlic- each were prepared very well and we savored each bite. The dessert is a must try- I suggest the Pandan ice cream and Thai Coffee Lava Cake. Lastly, the service was phenomenal- Lai had our food out quickly and checked on us regularly. I definitely suggest Chai Yo!",

Even when we were being sat, the Manager saw a couple tiny water spots on the table and said oh hey I see some water spots let me get that. Attention to detail! Then came the appetizers. We have the chicken corn cakes and basil rolls, soooo good! So flavorful! The sauce that comes with the basil rolls is a good amount of spice but even more flavorful, I'd buy that in bottle! Then I got the curry lobster tail noodle dish. It quickly jumped to the top of my favorite seafood meal in Atlanta. The tail was hearty, cooked perfectly and perfect flavoring. My boyfriend got the pork belly with basil fried rice. It was a completely different flavor from mine but just as delicious! Chai-Yo, well done!",
