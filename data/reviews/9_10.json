There are so many quirky things to look at, plenty of photo ops , from the giant weenie for good luck at the door, to rwo skeletons riding motorcycles, and a whole lot more in between. The bar has a ton of beer and cocktail options. The menu is more like a book. The food options are amazing. From the Fat Elvis Burger to the quadruple coronary bypass. You cannot leave this place unhappy it would be impossible. Do yourself a favor and check it out you must be 21 and over to enter since it is mostly a bar with an amazing kitchen/grill. \nDon't forget to rub the weenie for luck at the  entrance.",

They basically ignored us for 20 minutes and we had to actually go inside and ask if someone could help us twice! Not even that crowded ! Wait staff terribly lackadaisical! They not in no rush ! Be clear-Took our drink orders and wouldn't take food order even though we were ready -they said someone else would come take food order but of course then no one came ! Had to go back in to request someone to come take our food order! WTH -Won't return ! We asked for check and just paid for our tea and water\nWhich should have been free considering the service! Sowe left and went to cypress st pint and plate - highly recommend it!",

By the way the decorations are pretty interesting and we loved the skull chandeliers. \n\nThey are known for their burgers but the burger was just ok to me. It had a good flavor but I wouldn't put it at the top of my list but it was good. The wings are pretty darn good. Get the cheese bites. Worth it! Hints of jalapeño in the bites and it has a jalapeño ranch that comes with it. \n\nI got one of their speciality drinks (I can't recall the name right now) and it was strong so be prepared for some liquored up drinks. \n\nParking is done by a meter or a parking garage here so add those couple of bucks to your tab or Uber if you come to try it.",

I got the Elvis burger that has peanut butter and fried plantains. What a banger! Pleasantly surprised. \nMy drink was a Savannah Spritz. Very delicious. \nFour stars because my server was kinda off. She was crouching down to eye level and giving other guest great attention. For me and my partner, she'd zip away as quickly as she could. Whatever. \nAlso, bathrooms are very clean!\nOverall, definitely a spot to try if your in Atlanta or if you're a mega fat-a$$ (in a good way lol)",

There was a 30 minute wait when we got there which wasn't bad because it's Saturday night. After we got seated our waiter was by really quickly to see if we were ready to order drinks. What what husband ordered a golden monkey and I ordered a 10-year-old Scotch. He came back later to get our food order we started with the nachos and added sour cream and jalapeños both were aside charge. My husband ordered the hot burger sorry I don't know the name of it and I ordered the four horsemen. Very good burgers very messy. The nachos were awesome as well exactly what we needed to snack on while drinking waiting for our burgers. After the scotch I ordered the ATLiens which kind of reminded me of a slightly spiced hard lemonade which was very good. I had thought about ordering some more to drink but got too engrossed with the wonderful food.\n\nThank you for text we will be back.",

Just remember you have to be 21+ to come in at all times!\n\nThe funnel stick fries were delicious (not pictured) but were a great recommendation from our waitress for pairs to share!\n\nMy only \"con\" to this specific location is the parking situation. The lot directly across cost $15 to park and with both of us driving we spent $30 parking and $40 on food... it was definitely an expensive outing so my recommendation would be to carpool or park free on a nearby street and walk over.",

        "text": "My husband and I were craving some solid meaty burgers so we ordered take-out from Vortex. The order was ready fairly quickly and it was a positive pickup experience.\n\nLet's start with the burgers. We got one Classic Bypass (topped with a fried egg, American cheese, and bacon) and one Retro Diner Burger (2 sirloin patties, Swiss and Cheddar cheese, grilled onion, dill pickle). Everything was fresh and of good quality. The Retro Diner Burger was exactly what we expected. However, my Classic Bypass was very bland and slightly dry, lacking the smokey grill flavor as well. Overall it's quite different from when we visited in person pre-COVID.\n\nOn the positive side, we loved the Dixie Wrecked Taters, tator tots covered in sausage gravy, cheddar cheese, and bacon!! The potato salad, also has bacon and cheese, is to die for!\nI'd go back just for these.\n\nWe will give it another try when we go back to normal for sure!",

That said, I was looking for a post-workout protein fix before I crashed for the night and figured this would be as good of a place as any. This location has the same divey atmosphere I remember and I liked that they were checking people at the door. The menu has a huge selection of fancy burgers and I went with the guac version done medium rare. It was served to perfection with a good helping of fries. Service was attentive and I was even offered a to go cup for my Diet Coke. This would be a great place to stop back for dinner and drinks. I'd definitely do Vortex again over other chains on the block like Taco Mac.",

Mannnnn, after being in the restaurant for 90 mins somebody burst my window and went under my seat to steal my job's laptop that was prob worth $400-$500 that I need to use all the time. I'm a Firefighter/Paramedic serving and helping the community and barely making it to survive day to day and some sorry A$$ cost me more money than the laptop is worth. It cost $600 to replace my side windows.  The cop shows up in a timely manner and tells us ppl break in hundreds of cars ALL THE TIME in the parking lot and the cameras do NOT work... So I come out to enjoy a burger and end up spending over $600. I wonder why is t there a security guard posted up. These businesses make lots of $$$ and why aren't the cameras working. I'm 2022 operable Cameras are pretty cheap to installed and operate from an app but I guess the criminal minded person will continued to have a \"feast\" breaking in cars if no changes are being made. The burgers were great not worth the agony of worrying abt my car being harm.\nGee thanks. I should have gone to Burger King for a burger. . I won't be back..... EVER...",

Remember that it's 21+ no exceptions, and that the security guard will ID you at the front or at the table if no one is at the front.\n\nI don't often crave burgers, but if I do, Vortex really hits the spot. I got the 'KA'MANA WA'NA LEI'YA' which is a tropical burger that has a big glob of chipotle cream cheese, bacon, and pineapple jalapeño jelly. I could have gone with less chipotle cream cheese, but I guess it's for the aesthetic. Pineapple jalapeño jelly really slapped though! I found myself dipping my fries in the excess. \n\nAlso, this is one of the few places in Midtown that serves pickle fries and I'm always a sucker for those!\n\nThey have an extensive beer selection, and fun raunchy decor ranging from tame dusty license plates to playboy covers and a large dick statue at the front. It's almost always loud and dark inside and much hubbub going around. Have fun yall!",

Want to land yourself a hospital visit?Try the Triple Coronary Bypass burger estimated at over 7,000 calories! My friend and I weren't feeling that adventurous and opted for the holy guacamole burger and the black and blue. Both delicious, made fresh, and arguably the best burgers we've ever had! For our drinks we had mystery shots (bartenders choice) and beer. \n\nThis location also has a comedy bar in the back. I haven't been able to check it out yet but that's next on my bucket list!",

That may be why I never went while I lived downtown in college. The location gave me bar/restaurant vibes. I ordered the Holy Guacamole with tater tots. It was fantastic. I believe that all of the burgers come with a side for the most part. I also ordered a 12 ounce IPA for like $5. The drinks were pretty cheap as well as the food. I paid for our lunch and spent $40. \n\nI definitely witnessed what the hype was about The Vortex. I will for sure be going back.",

Eh I've had some just as good but it is a great burger. \n\nThe fried zucchini and the sauce it came with definitely was much better than I thought it would be! Even though I had a good amount I wanted more.\n\nNext time I want to try one of their other specialty burgers.",

It's a unique place as far as decor/theme and the food is amazing. My friend and I decided to get two burgers and split them. We were having a hard time choosing which two burgers to get so we gave our server a few options and asked him which two we should get. He responded with no hesitation about the two we should order so we felt confident in the choices that were made. Both burgers were equally delicious, I'm not sure I could pick a favorite.

My boyfriend got the mac and cheese burger and he said it was delicious. The Hell's Fury was very spicy. I enjoy spicy food but that too spicy for me. I had to scrape off the jalapeno and the habanero relish. I tried a bit of the atomic death sauce along with a piece of my burger and my mouth was on fire!

If you go at the right time, you can try their bypass burgers, which look insane. \n\nI didn't think much of this burger chain...it just looks like a dive bar serving pretty average food. But that definitely was not the case. \n\nClassic bypass burger: essentially a bacon cheeseburger but there's onions and pickles as well. The whole thing is huge, and I really had to squish the burger down just to take a bite. Gets messy so have plenty of napkins ready! Comes with a side and I got tater tots. Nothing really special about them. \n\nOff the deep end: apparently this is one of their strongest drinks. It comes with several different kinds of vodkas but you can't really taste it. Kind of dangerous! \n\nHighly recommend! But maybe share the dish with another person. Half of the burger definitely would've been enough for me.",

When I arrived I went in and found them and the server came by. I placed an order for a beverage and she brought out my food. I saw that my wife had the peanut butter bacon burger which she loves. She said it was delicious. For me she ordered the Mac N Cheesy Changa appetizer. She knew it was right up my alley when she read it on the menu. It is BBQ pulled pork and macaroni and cheese wrapped up in a flour tortilla, deep fried, sliced and drizzled with more cheese. It looked delicious and tasted just as good.\n\nWe sat and chatted a while until we each had to be on our way. Overall it was a good experience.

I've walked by before and the wait was over an hour and I would not wait that long to eat here having now eaten here. \n\nHowever, the decor is interesting such as the nudity and genitalia throughout. \n\nThe drinks are cheap. The food is average priced for a bar burger ~$12 but cheap if you consider you get bacon and other toppings. \n\nIt was really stuffy inside, people packed everywhere so definitely bar mentality. Too claustrophobic tbh. They allow smoking so don't breathe too deeply. \n\nParking available in lots nearby.",
