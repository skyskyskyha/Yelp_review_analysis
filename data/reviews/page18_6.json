        "text": "This place is so underrated!! While all the tourist go to the chain restaurants, I always pick this place over anywhere else in downtown. It's about a 15 minute walk to Mercedes Benz stadium and a 5 minute walk to State Farm arena. It's located right across from Centennial Olympic Park. The burgers are scrumptious! I highly recommend either the wings or burgers. Service can be slow depending on how busy they are but it's worth the wait. They also have a spin the wheel option if you spend more than $50...they have BOGO drinks or free shots with the spin. It's just a fun sports bar atmosphere. I love this place!",

        "text": "***If you plan to go during a busy day or weekend I would definitely suggest riding around & comparing parking prices before you settle. The first garage we drove by was charging about $35 while one that was one street over charged $10.***\n\nIt's located within walking distance of Skyview ATL, The CNN Center, Phillips Arena, Centennial Olympic Park, and countless hotels. \n\nDecided to stop here after I heard about the \"3-2-1\" special. 3 drinks in 1 glass for the price of 2. Best thing ever! Not sure who the bartender was the night but she definitely gave me my money's worth! Also ordered the BYOB (Build Your Own Burger) and side of tater tots. Delicious! \n\nLuckily I'd read reviews and knew about the \"Spend $40, Spin the Wheel\" deal because our waitress definitely didn't advertise it. Won shots of Fireball (which I wasn't too thrilled about) but it was definitely a nice incentive! The wheel had a variety of prizes from free shots to money off your bill.\n\nIf you're looking for bar food and vibes while hanging out downtown definitely stop here!",

Don't forget the parking behind here isn't free, yes I am responsible for paying and you have a job to do but I feel like they are waiting to scam you with a boot. I thought we could pay after. \nIt's 75$ for the boot next time I'm keeping the boots. Fuck scamming people all day. Not sign to remind people to pay at the door. \nToday has been a hard day for my girlfriend and me. We were trying to forget about it and have lunch. I also thought we could pay by phone inside. iPhone user \nThe food was better we both had salads. I also am trying NOT to be mean. It wasn't nothing to remember but it was ruined because of this boot. Couldn't really read the menu well, but I have perfect vision. You have to scan by phone and u wouldn't have know that if I didn't see it with my perfect ass vision. \nThe waitress did well same as any place around, but I wish I knew what dressing I was getting. I don't like ranch fuck the reason. I'm not picky with food wasn't a-lot in the salad, covered it with blue cheese. Don't like the cheese sticks maybe because of the boot. That's what happens when you know they are scamming in the back we only gonna tip little u 25%. Price is fair but not really. 40$ for two salads and 2 sides.",

No tables available, so we sat by the door and waited for about 15 minutes. Finally a waitress asked if we wanted drinks, at which point she showed the menu and walked away. Finally a table came available that we were sitting and waiting for them to leave at which point a bus boy gave the table to some people who just walked in. My wife and I said we had been waiting 15 minutes and the bus boy said \"okay\" and still sat his friends. Rudeness is very much unappreciated.",

The pulled pork sandwich was ok, but paired with cold tater tots made the overall meal pretty unappealing. Possibly good for wings or smaller bar bites, but I'd stick to drinks here.",

        "text": "What a cool little spot downtown. Me and the bf were on an adventure downtown this past weekend enjoying all of the Dragoncon festivities and we were looking to park it at a bar and have a few drinks. Well because of Dragoncon all the close by bars/restaurants like Hooters and Hard Rock  Cafe were beyond packed. Well of course I pulled out good 'ol Yelp and found this gem to be a quick walk away and we headed here with hopes of squeezing in. \nThis place was right near the sky wheel and just enough out of the way to be less crowded...still busy..but doable. They have an upstairs bar that was open as well and and little patio area (not seated) that you can go and enjoy the hot humid weather of Atlanta! But it was great. The bartenders were quick and the pours were just right. There was a good crowd from the college football kickoff game and vendors outside playing music so it was great. Also for a Saturday night and a crowd of drunk people  the restroom was pretty reasonable and not too messy.  \nPrices were on par with the area. I stuck with some L.I.T's and they were $10 for a regular which was actually a decent size. They also offered a double and triple size as well which in hindsight would've been a better investment.I can't attest to the food, but if you're looking for a drink I'd say to stop by and check this place out.",

There aren't a ton of options (that I found) that are open late during the week in the area, so Park Bar is a good choice for late night post concert munchies.\n\nThey have a standard bar food type menu (lots of friend options).  I have tried the sampler platter (hotzarella sticks, eggrolls, wings, and onions rings), tater tots (side dish), caprese salad, wings and egg rolls.  The only thing out of those options I would not recommend would be the caprese salad.  The basil was limp and dying, and lets be honest - not really the place you would expect to have amazingly fresh produce.  Stick to your fried, bar fare and you can't go wrong here.\n\nThey have an extensive beer list, showcasing lots of local beers if you're interested in that.  \n\nThe prices are a little high, but I'm guessing you can blame the location for that.",

I spent several evenings here over the duration of my trip and it was my favorite thing about being in Atlanta.",

I have that kind of foodie/beer/bourbon skill about me. \nThe do their tots so well that I told my guys they were homemade--I really had it in my memory that they were homemade-- that's how good all the rest of the food (and the TOTS) are. The burger with jam, jalapeños and pimento Cheese?  RUFKM?\nThe only problem I have with posting this review is that it may contribute to trouble for me getting in there whenever I may be in town. Seriously, it's frikkin awesome, but stay away when I'm in town. \nOh yea, 2 guys in my group got the short rib both said it was insane.",

Bartender knew a bunch of regulars by name and accompdated the TVs as best she could. \n\nAs far as beer, about 10 on tap and mostly regular brews. Some bottles but nothing crazy. Lots of alcohol and deals though, like bogo and spin the wheel if bill over $50 to possibly get another drink for the road. \n\nOverall a solid downtown bar that's priced well and has that homely feel with plenty of sports and TV.",
