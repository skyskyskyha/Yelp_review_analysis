That started the fiasco! Allllll the way down hill from there! In a juxtaposed way. I fell into the best seasonings and blend of food, texture, spice and taste! The fried salmon to the grilled salmon, the Mac n cheese, greens, and the fried chicken was delicious. To top it all off the bread pudding was phenomenal! I have to leave ATL, so that I don't go back! This is heaven for your taste buds!",

        "text": "I was super excited to try Virgil's in West Midtown! They didn't have any reservations available so my husband and I walked in on a Sunday evening around 6:30PM. First of all, this location is perfect and I love the industrial feel of the restaurant. It is spacious and has lovely decor. The host quickly greeted us and let us know we could grab some seats at the bar. We decided to sit upstairs. The bartender/server was attentive and my peach margarita was delicious. We tried the shellfush plate, slammin' sammen, and were comped some corn muffins. Everything was so good and the leftovers made a delicious meal for the day. The music playing in the background of the restaurant added to the overall vibey feel. I will definitely be back! 10/10 would recommend.",

We were seated upstairs, the hostess informed us that if our meal is over $100 we would automatically be charged 21% gratuity. I felt good about the place because I loved the hip vibe and trendy decor. R&B music was playing in the background. The place was small, they were busy but not overcrowded. Here's where everything went left. We first ordered 2 cocktails and 2 appetizers, after 45min went by and nothing on the table, we flagged down the waiter with him saying the bartender never got the order, so we had to wait another 10min for 2 cocktails. Our entrees arrived an hr and half later. I got shrimp and grits my husband got fish and fries. The food was good but definitely not worth the 2 hr wait. Our ticket was under $100 and We were charged the 21% anyway. I informed the waiter and he made corrections. If you're okay with extremely slow service then I would visit.",

Everything we ordered came out quickly and was hot and delicious. This is a Gullah restaurant and they have some good seasoned and flavorful dishes. The seafood with grits was amazing. It included fried shrimp and oysters with grits served with crabmeat on top. I sat at the bar and the bartender made me some of her signature drinks, including a mimosa with tequilla. She was very nice and even made recommendations to me on her favorite eateries in Atlanta.  Definitely look forward to stopping back by next time I am in the area.",

NO one never said anything nor did we get just a finger up showing hey please give us a second. And yes they seen us standing there it's not huge  and no it wasn't jammed packed at all! So one of the waiting guests sat herself and the other goes over to the bar and ask the lady hey should we keep waiting . She then sarcastically say yes give me a second. He came back like wow we're only trying to follow their rules. Ok so another lady finally comes downstairs and ask where would we like to sit..she wasn't apologetic at all! As I was seated she tells me we are out of greens, egg rolls, and some type of soup!! Immediately I'm disappointed because I came for the AFTA church plate that includes greens. SMH!  however, I'm then given a list of things that you can't do as far as substitute. I said ok so if I'm planning to order something that includes something you are out of then I can't get another side??? WOW. This lady charged me for every item separately because they were out of a sides (greens) that's on their menu! It was only a few bucks higher but that's NOT the problem it's the principle of the matter!I say all this to say my people must do better. I could have chosen several other locations to go eat dinner but decided to try them and I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED.  VERY. SMH \nOh.. And I forgot to mention in my google review I tried the cabbage and green beans as a replacement and BOTH WAS NOT GOOD AT ALL.",

        "text": "I decided to have my birthday brunch with some of my faves at Virgil's West Midtown.  While the food was delicious and, barring any issues, would warrant them five stars but everything else dropped them to a generous three. \n\nUsing Open Table, I was able to book a reservation for 8. A rep from the restaurant messaged me twice to confirm the appt and notify me of the 15-minute grace period, 20% gratuity for parties over six, and the need for 80% of the party to be present to be seated. Ok, cool, pretty standard stuff. \n\n\nOn the day, we all arrived on time, minus one who accidentally went to the College Park location. No problem, my 80% was there. After a short wait, we were seated upstairs when the host told us we had a 1.5-hour limit from when we sat and not when we received our order. Excuse me?  That would have been reasonable if our server wasn't doing double duty as bartender and arrived to greet us and begin taking orders 15 minutes after we sat. I don't fault her because she was incredibly stretched thin. After asking for water four times, the table finally received some 45 minutes into our visit. After eating and waiting for our checks, our server delivered them some time later. Despite extending grace about the packed restaurant with a server who couldn't be attentive, the host told us we were over our time limit. Sir, we just got the check.  I get they have to turn over tables but telling us we were over our time limit when the timeliness issue is with the restaurant.",

Truly friendly, anknowledgeable, and hospitable. (I will be returning soon just to take pics of food and drinks and to order items we didn't order this night ) \n\nWe ordered shareable and individual plates. Everything was tasty  and we found the drinks to be reasonably boozy and complimentary to the dishes. \n\nThe chef came by our table by complete happenstance just to check up on us, too. That's what I call world-class attention to detail. This island gal appreciates it.",

The waitress appeared annoyed, and got the manager. The manager appeared unbothered, but suggested a refund. Minutes later he reappeared with a receipt showing I was refunded $38.01.

The music was fantastic, and I ordered the Afta Church Plate, which consists of Mac & Cheese, Fried Chicken Wings, and Collards. The food was delicious and so was the sweet tea.

Didn't get a chance to chat with a manager or owner. Vibe is very ATL - especially for Labor Day weekend. \n\nOk so the food - it was tasty. Waitress said they were out of red rice, a signature Gullah staple, but my daughter's plate arrived with red rice!  Good news, the red rice was very good! \n\nThey were out of Corona too - Thursday night ?!  WTH!\n\nTried my fav childhood seafood, Deviled Crabs - not bad but they're not usually deep fried. \n\nCrab rice was mushy. Couldn't see grains or crab. The fried green tomatoes were bland with little sauce to bring this alive.  \n\nMy BFF had their salmon and rice; jasmin rice had hard or uncooked grains tucked under the fish. Salmon was the best meal at the table. \n\nSo we were wondering why our waitress wasn't in a hurry for anyone or anything. Come to find out, a gratuity is added to every check  - even parties of 3!?!  Apparently it's an ATL thang to do that. We paid $36 for slow service - with a smile. \n\nWith so many, delicious, unique, places to eat in ATL, to repeat, it has to be outstanding.  Virgil's was not.",

        "text": "Virgil's is one of my favs. As soon as I land, I usually hit up the location in College Park. Tried the Midtown location for the first time today. Beautiful deck/patio but the noise level makes it slightly hard to converse. \n\nMy food was okay. Usually, when I indulge in unhealthy food, I can deal with it better when it's tasty. The food was just slightly below okay. The servers were more into the music than the guest. \n\nMy server, Dior, as great. Thank God for him because I believe that I was forgotten. Took a minute for a server to come over. \n\nFood was Meh. Drinks were Meh. Still a Virgil's fan but feel like I need to leave here and go get something satisfying. \n\nAnd there's this sewage stench the blows by on the lower patio. Made we want to throw up  (not sure if it had anything to do with sitting right above the grease trap but man....what a way to ruin my appetite). Someone in a red shirt came by and asked me to leave a review and asked if everything was ok. Honestly, I didn't feel comfortable saying, \"no, I'm unhappy...had a long business day and my food and the smell is trash.\" People are defensive, didn't feel like the fight or argument and just chalked it up as a loss. \n\nThey started covering the seats when I was still sitting there finishing my drink .... It was like a 'please leave' action \n\nMaybe there will be a next time. If not, I still pray this business continues to thrive. Nice to see how they've expanded. Much success",

        "text": "Passed by Virgil's on my way to another restaurant and decided to stop in. I sat at the bar as a party of one. \nTo start off with the pros: My bartender was attentive. He took my order quickly, suggested drinks, gave recommendations. I ended up getting the crab rice, 4 wings, and a Deleon reposado drink. My food came out within 15 minutes max, and it was pretty good. \n\nNow for the cons: Although it was good, the crab rice was a small portion. I ordered the wings just in case. They were regular fried whole wings drizzled with their special sauce. The size of them reminded me of American deli. Really small for $13.00. \n\nSo after 2 appetizers and a drink, my bill ended up being 45.00 USD (not including parking). For the life of me, I genuinely don't understand the price point. 18.00 US DOLLARS for a Deleon drink? Nothing special about it, no garnishes, no show, just Deleon and pineapple lol. \n\nWhat started out as a quick lunch turned into a pricey meal and I was still hungry after. My experience here wasn't horrible, but definitely not good enough for the price they charge. It's been a few hours since I left, and it really left a sour taste in my mouth. Idk if it's the new Atlanta scene, but it's really disappointing.",

We ordered appetizers and the yella boi drink. The drink was good and strong! The chicken and egg rolls were really good. I really liked that this location is larger than the one in college park. It has seating upstairs and downstairs. They ambiance was really nice. They had some good r&b and soul music playing. It did start to get busy around 7:30pm with more of a crowd showing up. I will come back to this location and try more items off the menu. Glad to have this location since it's closer to me!",

Has two outdoor patios with great views of the city! Lots of space to move around and parking. It was a good crowd but I didn't have to worry about hours long waits. The service was great and everyone was so personable. They told me the building is a converted two story firehouse which is really cool. \n\nAs soon as I tasted the blackened salmon I went mhmm ...It was so good and I was full! It's not a lounge vibe yet like CP Virgil's but they had good 90s R&B soul playlist and it's much more like a traditional restaurant. This is going to be my go to spot for sure!",

        "text": "Happy Hour with friend\nAs I approached, I noticed there was an open parking lot right next door. From what I understood, parking is free for the first 2 hours for restaurant patrons. I entered and waited for my friend to arrive. I found a few seats available at the bar. I sat there for a while until the bartender finally made an appearance. I asked about the happy hour menu, and she provided a sticky, dirty paper menu that looked a little worn. Then I noticed the bar itself was a little sticky. I reviewed the menu and asked about the happy hour beers. The bartender advised that no beers were available because the taps were not working. After a few minutes of conversation, I finally figured out that I could order a bottle of beer at regular price. I decided to order a Modello. Looking around, the place had a very nice ambiance and decor. From where I was sitting, I could look right into the kitchen. My friend arrived and also asked about the happy hour menu. He was told they had a specialty drink available, a Mango Martini. He ordered that while I was still working on my Modello. We found out the Mango Martini was made with Tequila, Vermouth, Sour Mix, and Mango Juice. That sounded like a strange mixture of stuff, and when it arrived, and he tasted it he said it was \"Disgusting\".  Also, while we were sitting at the bar, we kept getting a sour smell coming from somewhere behind the bar. We could not pinpoint what it was or where it was coming from. My friend went to the bathroom on the second floor, and when he returned, he advised that there was another bar up there. I finished my Modello, and he left his unfinished drink at the bar. We went upstairs, and the great decor continued. We approached the bar and asked about the happy hour menu. The bartender was a little confused, but eventually got everything clarified. He advised that the craft beer taps were working, and I could get the 16 oz for $2. My friend found out he could get the house vodka mixed with pineapple juice for $2. Win and Win! We enjoyed a few rounds and ordered some wings from the happy hour menu. Our bartender advised that they were whole chicken wings. We started small and ordered four. They arrived pretty quickly.  The wings were a good size and had a good crunch. We could tell they were very fresh, but they could have used a little more salt/seasoning. Overall, they were tasty and a perfect after-drinks appetizer. No guarantee you will have the same experience that we did, but upstairs saved the downstairs. It turned this review from a negative to a positive. We will be coming back for happy hour and go right to the second level.  They even have some outdoor and balcony seating to enjoy when the weather heats up.  Great happy hour deals (once they got it all worked out), good food,  great ambiance, super clean bathrooms in this Black Owned restaurant/bar.",

Making eye contact means nothing. She never came to check on us. \n\nTwo families left because they didn't receive service after being seated. \n\nThe drinks were good. Even though we only got to order 1 due to the lack of customer service. And the food was underwhelming. It wasn't busy at all. maybe 4 families there. We went in the middle of the day.

The layout here is great with both indoor and outdoor dining options and the atmosphere is classy chic.\n     Ordered the Afta Church Plate which comes with 4 whole fried wings, macaroni and cheese, and collard greens. I opted to get the sweet and spicy drizzle sauce on the side so I could regulate my dipping. The food was amazing! The wings were perfectly seasoned and fried and the two sides were also flavorful, I especially liked the greens. I partook in some mimosas too, which were also good.\n     The customer service provided by XO and the other employees that came by to check on us was wonderful. I also appreciated that Bentley (presumably the GM) stopped by to speak to us as well and get some customer feedback.  Everything was on point and it was a very welcoming and relaxing dining experience. If the business is reading this review, please continue to maintain the quality of food and service you provided and I will definitely keep coming back!",

The manager Bella of the restaurant had her baby with her while she was working but the manager was completely neglecting her duties. She didn't check on us once during the meal, and our food arrived cold and unappetizing.\n\nAs if the lack of service weren't bad enough, the manager also let her baby crawl around the restaurant, which is a major health hazard. It's unhygienic to have a baby on the ground where people are eating, and it's a clear violation of health and safety regulations.\n\nOverall, I was extremely disappointed with my experience at this restaurant and I won't be returning. The manager needs to prioritize her job and ensure that her customers are taken care of, instead of bringing her baby to work and neglecting her responsibilities.",
