Prices were reasonable. Lots of choices to choose from for both food and drinks. What I loved about it too is that they had a very decent sized Gluten Free menu. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for that sports bar styled restaurant.",

The bartender let favoritism take over and started to prioritize the two white women that came in and sat down, after we had already ordered. By the convo, they knew one another personally or were regulars. While we were waiting on our food, the two women got served drinks AND their food out first. SAME food item, as my friend ordered prior to their arrival... No special cooking instructions.\n\nThe alcoholic drinks I had were tasty but for the size vs prices, definitely should have at least another half ounce of liquor added. I had the jumbo crab cake and the asparagus fries. They were delicious! I wouldn't necessarily go back. I need great drinks and I want to not feel like I have to be familiar with the staff, to receive consistent or their best service. To each their own...",

The bar was busy but we managed to get two seats. When we sat we were greeted by our bartender Daniel. We ordered a Manhattan and a Greygoose martini. Both were well crafted and poured into a frosty martini glass. The cocktails were delicious...so much so we had to have another round. Oops!\n\nThe atmosphere was pleasant and the service was great. Daniel was attentive and even wrote his and his fellow bartender's (his wife) name on a service card for us in the event that we needed them for anything. This was a nice touch.\n\nAlthough this was our first visit to Marlow's and we did not dine, the great service and delicious cocktails have us wanting to visit again soon.",

Then it's topped with cheese, pickles and a crispy bun; the sandwich literally melts in your mouth! BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD hands down!

        "text": "Had to add Marlowe's back to the rotation for a little Sunday Brunch. Wanted to meet up with a friend and we know Marlowe's has a pretty good Brunch Buffet that is reasonably priced. \nArriving toward the beginning of the Brunch period (11:30ish) served us well as there was no wait to be seated. No reservations needed (and I don't believe they are offered for the brunch). \nParking wasn't an issue as we parked in the parking deck around the corner (towards the highway). It was free parking in the deck. Street parking also available for those lucky enough to find a spot. \nWe were seated in a nice comfortable booth; we had our choice of seating based on the availability. \nThe buffet had all the right choices. Waffles, french toast, eggs, sausage, bacon, dessert bars, etc. A cook was also available for custom omelet orders. Most everything was delicious. The french toast may have sat a little too long on the heat at a certain point, but that was minor. \nThe juice (orange) tasted a little funny as well, but that may have just been the brand. \nOverall good service, good fellowship, and good eats!",

        "text": "Went to Marlow's on a Saturday around 3-ish. It wasn't super crowded but we had to wait to be greeted at the hosted stand. I would say it took about 5 minutes for someone to greet us and seat us at our table. They had to be short staffed or something because it wasn't crowded at all.\n\nI ordered appetizers for my meal. I had the crab and shrimp nachos and the asparagus fries. I'd give the crab and shrimp nachos about a 3 out of 5. They were solid, but I wish the chips were crunchy, they were a bit soggy for my liking. Also, they had globs of cheese on each chip, which was a bit much for me (this is coming from someone who is obsessed with cheese). Also, I'm not the biggest fan of imitation crab meat, so that's another reason I gave it 3 out of 5, but for $10.50 you can't expect real crab lol. It wasn't a bad choice by any means but prob wouldn't get it again. Now the asparagus fries were to die for! They are truly a good alternative to French fries. I wish more restaurants offered this as an option. I definitely suggest that you try these. \n\nOverall, this is a solid place for a Tavern. If you are in the area and just want decent bar food then this place is more than okay. If you are in a hurry, it may not be the place for you.",

We also got hummus as appetizer, which we all really liked! Our server was also super polite and helpful, I wish I could remember her name, but she did do her best to make this a great experience.

        "text": "Marlow's tavern is a fairly chill and busy spot right in the middle of midtown Atlanta. It's located within walking distance of a number of other restaurants, businesses, and residences. We came here with a group of 20 people or so and had a great time. \n\nWe were divided into 2 large tables next to each other, it didn't look like there was any space available that could have fit all of us in 1 table. The waitress came by often to take our food and drink orders and check in on us. Best part is that even with such a large group, we never felt like the waitress dropped the ball or we had to wait excessively for food/drinks.\n\nWe had a variety of appetizers, the ones I tried were the buts, chicken wings and the truffled parmesan fries. The chicken wings were good, nothing out of the world but fried well with good flavor (the gorgonzola dip was very delish). The fries were ok, nothing to write home about. The nuts were good, but probably nothing you can't get at a decent grocery store. \n\nI got the filet, and it was mediocre. It was seasoned well enough and the sauce reduction was good, but it wasn't as tender as I hoped for. The parsnip bread budding was good, and so was the asparagus as well.\n\nBeers were good... came old and delicious so can't go wrong there.",

        "text": "First time here. Would definitely recommend. My daughters (all 3 adults) were in Atl. for something else and had time to spare. They found this place and I'm so glad they did. Best food I've had in a long time. We were treated with complimentary JT Chips. Made in house chips were so good. I got the black and blue burger (love these). However this one was made with Gorgonzola cheese (never had before) simply amazing. The burger was cooked to perfection with slight charring around the edge. My side was jumbo asparagus, they weren't literally jumbo but I didn't mind because they were delicious and cooked just right. The manager also gave up complimentary creme brûlée (never had before) it too was amazing. I cannot rave about this place or our food enough. Our server was ok (I've been in the food service industry over 30+ years) she wasn't bad she was very nice and sweet just needs more experience and confidence. The guy that sat us personality 10+, I think the chef (wearing white chef coat) brought us our appetizer and I seen him bussing a table that won major points with me. The manager that prebussed my table also very nice and seemed genuinely happy we had a great experience. I wish I could give this place more stars. Will definitely go back when in the area.",

I wondered if the lights were usually that dim....or was it the Halloween spirit as the decorations were already hanging and such.  being seated right away looking over the menu and deciding to have small bites to eat. went for the appetizers. Tuna poke/truffle fries/fried Shrimp/crab shrimp nacho.\nI know you're thinking 1 person did not eat all that ...lol but yes I did bc i was sharing it so I technically ate and sampled it all lol everything was excellet taste wise....but the crab shrimp nacho was more like a quesadilla  and a little too cheesy for my liking I had a blood orange margarita that I enjoyed also. When in the A. this is definitely a place I will consider going to again",

        "text": "Georgia native.. first visit to Marlow's. Ordered a Georgia Peach Margarita, Tavern Wings, Shrimp and Crab \"nachos\" and Parmesan truffle fries. Our server, Remi, was phenomenal, attentive and very knowledgeable of the dishes. We had the pleasure of having our dishes delivered by the Chef himself, very pleasant and admitted that he makes his food with passion not love. Passion's stronger . Now for THE FOOD!!! Amazing, delicious. The food was light but the flavors were bold and intense. Everything was the right temperature. The twang of the truffle fries was the perfect complement to the cheesy, slow burn of the Shrimp and Crab Nachos and the elevated flavors of the Tavern Wings. It's the thing you can't put your finger on that makes Marlow's a gem",

They have several bathrooms near the entrance private bathrooms and m/w single bathrooms (about 5). We ordered 2 glasses of Pinot noir and to our surprise.... it was a bit too cold for my taste. Reds should be room temperature but the bartender was insistent it was proper temp. No problem we're watching the game so I'll sip slow and it will soon be room temp. We decided to order an app and the Ahi sounded appetizing so we went with that... what a great choice!! It was delicious! The ahi was chunky and the Hawaiian sauce was delish. The crispy wontons definitely complemented it well. Satisfied customer",

We sat at the bar and chatted with the friendly bartenders.  The food was delicious... maybe we should live nearby?   We would never have guessed (and didn't find out until we moved the following year) that Marlow's is a local chain.  It really does feel like a local gem.  \n\nSince we moved down, we've made Marlow's our go-to place.  The bartenders are all really friendly.  We'll typically start with the buffalo wings, which are really great.  Sometimes we'll have the smoked trout dip which is very good too.  We rotate through all the different sandwiches which are ALWAYS amazing.  The Royal burger is also a winner.  We rarely venture to the \"mains\" section but we've really enjoyed the shrimp and grits.  \n\nOverall, Marlow's is a friendly neighborhood restaurant that does it right.",

Both were flavorful, fresh, and just all around superb.

        "text": "I finally was able to make it it Marlow's based on a suggestion from a friend. I really liked the set up and atmosphere with low lighting.  There are TVs everywhere which is a plus.  We weren't greeted when we walked and there was no one at the door so it was a little awkward standing and trying to figure out if it's seat yourself or what.  After we were greeted, they seated us quickly. They have many good choices on the menu that really had me torn! Shrimp and grits is usually a dish that I go to but I decided to do something different.  I went for the crab and shrimp nachos with parmesan truffle fries. I was very happy with my choice.  They aren't like the traditional nachos but rather similar to pizza bites just with seafood.  There was crab and shrimp on each one and the flavor was great! I loved the creamy sauce used. It's probably best to get it with a side because it probably won't fill you up by itself but it will taste good trying! Lol the truffle fries were okay. Kind of softer than I liked but seasoned well.  I was able to taste the shrimp and grits and I will definitely be getting that the next time around!",

        "text": "Marlow's Tavern is one of the popular lunch places near my office mostly because of its proximity.  I've eaten here a few times, and it's OK.  With \"OK\" meaning, if there was a place that I liked better or I wanted to walk further than a block, I would go to that place.  \n\nI've had many things on the menu but would only recommend the grilled chicken stack.  It's a substantial amount of protein with two chicken breasts but still doable in one sitting.  The chicken, squash, sun-dried tomato sauce, and olive oil all come together for a very tasty dish that is appropriate for lunch or dinner.  There is also a small bit of crumbled bacon in this dish, but not enough to make me swoon (I LOVE BACON), however it did add a nice bit of texture and flavor to the dish.\n\nThe only thing I would steer you away from are the fries.  They looked so delicious passing by that I ordered some as a side and they were tough and dry.  Looked gorgeous; tasted awful. \n\nService is hit or miss; sometimes it's really good, sometimes it's OK and other times your server will disappear.  Cross your fingers and take your chances for a winner.  \n\nThe décor is a bummer.  All that black furniture is depressing and doesn't feel tavern-y to me. I can't imagine drinking a beer here.  I can't even imagine drinking a cocktail here, and I'm always open to vodka.  Also, they don't have happy hour drink specials; one of the bartenders told me that's because it's illegal to have happy hour drink specials in GA.  (I told him that several other restaurants were ignoring that rule completely because I've been to plenty of happy hours with $5 martinis and tequila shots.)\n\nIn conclusion, Marlow's is OK.  \n\nYelp 100 #32",

I always sit at the bar - Benton and Parks are nice guys to chat with when you're there. \n\nI pretty much always order wings because I don't want too much else on the menu. The French Dip is really good; the toasts are fine.  I don't like the deconstructed shrimp and grits (the grit cake reads as polenta, which I don't love). \n\nThe kitchen is unfussy - once I said I was craving buffalo mac, so they made me mac and cheese and put buffalo chicken strips on top.  Easy.  \n\nDefinitely an easy place to stop in for a drink and/or meal if you're in the area.  Also lots of TVs if you're into sports.",

I decided to try the asparagus fries and I'm so glad I did. I was worried a little about the tarragon in the aioli since it's not my favorite flavor but there was absolutely nothing bad about these. 10/10 wish I could get them at home. I followed it up with the black and blue steak salad. I think the steak was a little more on the medium rare side than medium but I tend to order warmer places cuz this happens a lot. I didn't get a pic of this cuz honestly it looked too good and I dove in. The pickled red onions are a great touch. Overall very pleased!",

Salads were old wilted lettuce greens unpeeled cucumbers, squishy tomatoes. Dressing was vacant of flavor and wait staff didn't really seem to care. However I did notice the men at the adjacent table had wonderful attentive service, food came before ours even though they arrived well after us. Their cooked meals miraculously took less time then a salad. So maybe if you are a white male this place might be okay.",

The waitress was delightful and promptly took our drink order and made some recommendations.  Wow!  She was spot on!!\n\nWe ordered the asparagus fries to start, light tempura asparagus served with a side of aioli.  Very tasty and the perfect size to share.  Since it was our first time at Marlow's the manager greeted us, and welcomed us to Marlow's with their signature starter the Kettle Chips - the chips were nice and crispy and dressed with bacon, tomatoes, and Gorgonzola!  Yum!\n\nFor the mains we went with 2 of the recs - the shrimp and grits and the Frisco Club - delicious!!  I had the Frisco Club paired with a Nice Small Salad -  just as the waitress stated, the flavors come together beautifully!  The portion was large and I took 1/2 of the sandwich in a box.  (BTW - me taking leftovers home says a lot about the food - I almost never do this, but the sandwich was so good I figured why not.  And later that day, the other half was just as good!)\n\nWe very much enjoyed the food, loved the friendly service, and will be back!",
