The hardest part is deciding which one to order!\n\nThey have funnel cake fries!  And the Tots were perfect as always. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. You cannot go wrong with any of the burger choices.\n\nSuper cool place with a bar feeling. Great beer selection including 2 that are brewed for them. I love the laughing skull amber. \n\nService is great. Be aware you can only come in if 21 or older. So leave the kiddos at home!",

        "text": "About a month ago my wife and I ate at the Vortex in Atlanta and had the worst service of our life. Our waitress named Sky L. made sure that we would never come back. For starters we got there an hour and a half before close and Sky told us we needed to be quick because they were closing soon. She then visited our table 2 more times the rest of the night and when my wife ordered a drink she never brought it and so my wife after 25 minutes went to another waitress after multiple attempts of trying to get our waitresses attention to see about the drink. Sky immediately came to our table then to get upset at my wife for getting another waitresses attention even though she refused to wait on us...After that moment she refused to make eye contact with us or say a word the rest of the night. She also wasn't busy her time was spent in the back and she only had three tables she was waiting on.",

We decided to go to bar and wait there, when seats emptied we sat down and ordered. They were busy so it took a good 20 minutes for the bartender to take out order after we sat down. The appetizer tater tots were very good with the melted cheese on top. The bbq mac and cheese burger was really good but the burger was burnt. We asked for well done but the burger was too well done. The buffalo wings were good but too crispy for my liking.",

The Cheese-Balls O' Glory goes really well with their house beer;  \nI had the Retro Diner Burger. it consists of two 4-ounce griddled sirloin patties with LTOP. Absolutely loved the food, environment, songs they were playing and of course the servers were very sweet. \nAs it's in Peachtree St. of course parking is a little difficult, there are roadside parallel Parkings available if you get lucky to find one, if not, you can always pay $5 and park in the parking garage that's next to PUBLIX. \nHave fun here this weekend!",

I do wish their sides were better (definitely tastes like the French fries from the freezer section) but the sandwiches makes up for it. Pickle Rick is the best!!",

The food was good but not great or memorable. We got the chicken roll appetizers which were probably my favorite part. They were very hot and creamy with a nice flavor. I got the classic bypass burger which was also just...good. The fried plantains were not that good to me, I barely ate them. Overall it is a fine place to eat but I wouldn't spend the money to go back.",

For food I got the KA'MANAWA' N ALEI'YA which was (A scoop of chipotle cream cheese, 3 slices of bacon and\nspicy pineapple jalapeño jelly on Texas toast for $12.95). Came with side of choice, I chose tater tots. The burger was absolutely delicious. I thought the value was great. Tots were great too and I got a side of ranch to dip in. Service was great. If you're looking for a no frills 21+ burger place this is it. Parking is iffy because midtown, but there are a few pay lots around. Definitely would return.",

By the way the decorations are pretty interesting and we loved the skull chandeliers. \n\nThey are known for their burgers but the burger was just ok to me. It had a good flavor but I wouldn't put it at the top of my list but it was good. The wings are pretty darn good. Get the cheese bites. Worth it! Hints of jalapeño in the bites and it has a jalapeño ranch that comes with it. \n\nI got one of their speciality drinks (I can't recall the name right now) and it was strong so be prepared for some liquored up drinks. \n\nParking is done by a meter or a parking garage here so add those couple of bucks to your tab or Uber if you come to try it.",

I got the Elvis burger that has peanut butter and fried plantains. What a banger! Pleasantly surprised. \nMy drink was a Savannah Spritz. Very delicious. \nFour stars because my server was kinda off. She was crouching down to eye level and giving other guest great attention. For me and my partner, she'd zip away as quickly as she could. Whatever. \nAlso, bathrooms are very clean!\nOverall, definitely a spot to try if your in Atlanta or if you're a mega fat-a$$ (in a good way lol)",

There was a 30 minute wait when we got there which wasn't bad because it's Saturday night. After we got seated our waiter was by really quickly to see if we were ready to order drinks. What what husband ordered a golden monkey and I ordered a 10-year-old Scotch. He came back later to get our food order we started with the nachos and added sour cream and jalapeños both were aside charge. My husband ordered the hot burger sorry I don't know the name of it and I ordered the four horsemen. Very good burgers very messy. The nachos were awesome as well exactly what we needed to snack on while drinking waiting for our burgers. After the scotch I ordered the ATLiens which kind of reminded me of a slightly spiced hard lemonade which was very good. I had thought about ordering some more to drink but got too engrossed with the wonderful food.\n\nThank you for text we will be back.",

Just remember you have to be 21+ to come in at all times!\n\nThe funnel stick fries were delicious (not pictured) but were a great recommendation from our waitress for pairs to share!\n\nMy only \"con\" to this specific location is the parking situation. The lot directly across cost $15 to park and with both of us driving we spent $30 parking and $40 on food... it was definitely an expensive outing so my recommendation would be to carpool or park free on a nearby street and walk over.",

        "text": "My husband and I were craving some solid meaty burgers so we ordered take-out from Vortex. The order was ready fairly quickly and it was a positive pickup experience.\n\nLet's start with the burgers. We got one Classic Bypass (topped with a fried egg, American cheese, and bacon) and one Retro Diner Burger (2 sirloin patties, Swiss and Cheddar cheese, grilled onion, dill pickle). Everything was fresh and of good quality. The Retro Diner Burger was exactly what we expected. However, my Classic Bypass was very bland and slightly dry, lacking the smokey grill flavor as well. Overall it's quite different from when we visited in person pre-COVID.\n\nOn the positive side, we loved the Dixie Wrecked Taters, tator tots covered in sausage gravy, cheddar cheese, and bacon!! The potato salad, also has bacon and cheese, is to die for!\nI'd go back just for these.\n\nWe will give it another try when we go back to normal for sure!",

        "text": "Any burger\n\nI've stayed nearby quite a few times now but have purposefully passed as I've been to one of the other locations some years back and like to check out new spots. That said, I was looking for a post-workout protein fix before I crashed for the night and figured this would be as good of a place as any. This location has the same divey atmosphere I remember and I liked that they were checking people at the door. The menu has a huge selection of fancy burgers and I went with the guac version done medium rare. It was served to perfection with a good helping of fries. Service was attentive and I was even offered a to go cup for my Diet Coke. This would be a great place to stop back for dinner and drinks. I'd definitely do Vortex again over other chains on the block like Taco Mac.",

Mannnnn, after being in the restaurant for 90 mins somebody burst my window and went under my seat to steal my job's laptop that was prob worth $400-$500 that I need to use all the time. I'm a Firefighter/Paramedic serving and helping the community and barely making it to survive day to day and some sorry A$$ cost me more money than the laptop is worth. It cost $600 to replace my side windows.  The cop shows up in a timely manner and tells us ppl break in hundreds of cars ALL THE TIME in the parking lot and the cameras do NOT work... So I come out to enjoy a burger and end up spending over $600. I wonder why is t there a security guard posted up. These businesses make lots of $$$ and why aren't the cameras working. I'm 2022 operable Cameras are pretty cheap to installed and operate from an app but I guess the criminal minded person will continued to have a \"feast\" breaking in cars if no changes are being made. The burgers were great not worth the agony of worrying abt my car being harm.\nGee thanks. I should have gone to Burger King for a burger. . I won't be back..... EVER...",
