        "text": "I want to start this review by saying two things: do not let the fact that this restaurant is inside a hotel deter you AND do not let the plain appearance of the outside of the building hold you back either! Once you enter the hotel, you feel like you are in a completely different establishment than the one you walked into. The inside has some of the coolest décor I've seen, a very large bar and lounge area if you're in the mood for some cocktails and small bites and the dining room has both booths and tables available right next to the open faced kitchen area. The ambiance is on point and the food is even better! I dined here with friends a few weeks ago and everything from the service to the food was superb. My friend and I agreed that we have not had a meal that good at a restaurant in a long time. We ordered a lot of things for our dinner and shared everything except our main entrees. I literally loved everything we ordered, which is rare for me. We learned that Fia means fire in Italian and it was a fitting name, because everything was fire! But really, it is called Fia, because several of their signature dishes are grilled over a wood fire grill. We tried the beets & burrata, pan seared potato gnocchi, pork belly, charred octopus, & grilled ciabatta bread as our starters. If you don't want to order all of these, I would say that the pork belly and the gnocchi are the must trys. Pro tip: be sure to order the grilled ciabatta bread with the gnocchi, because it comes with a yummy sauce that you will want to dip your bread in. For my entrée, I did the 8 ounce center cut filet with a side of crispy brussels sprouts. I highly recommend both of these items as both had that nice wood fire grill char to them, which made them extra flavorful! For the dessert, we did the Bananas Foster. Even though it is not prepared tableside, it tastes amazing. I say all this to say, you need to dine at Fia! It is a restaurant that everyone needs to experience!",

They were all sumptuous that we forgot to take pictures prior to devouring them! My husband had the grilled octopus - twice. The shrimp saganaki (sp?) was delicious. I requested for additional toasted bread that came with it. It was so good with the sauce. But I didn't get them even when I said I was willing to pay for it. Maybe because I told another server since ours was tied up with a big group. Oh and the pork belly is to die for! The crispy small potatoes were also delicious and matched the well flavored pork belly sauce. We were not too hungry. We would go back to try the entrees when we're back in Atlanta.

The restaurant wasn't quite busy yet when we arrived, but started to fill up as the evening went on. Our server was fantastic. I wish I remembered her name. She was very attentive and helpful. She made great suggestions.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the following:\nEspresso martinis \nPan seared potato gnocchi \nWhole branzino\nCrispy Brussels sprouts\nFingerling potatoes\n\nWe shared everything, except for the martinis -- we each got our own. :) We started with the pan seared potato gnocchi which was our server's recommendation. It came with beurre monte, white truffle, thyme, and parmesan and was incredible. Everything else was excellent; cooked and seasoned to perfection. The branzino is great for sharing especially if you get a couple of sides. We ordered plenty for the two of us. Our sweet server heard we were celebrating so she brought us a delicious and creamy creme brulee. Perfect ending to our night!\n\nFood, service, and ambiance were all on point. Fia is a little pricey, and worth every penny! Great place for date nights and/or other special occasions.",

And, when pulling up and realizing this was part of a small hotel, I almost left \n(did not have reservations). However, I'm glad we stayed. \nThe food was amazing. The menu is largely gluten-free without even asking, and the variety of dishes, styles, & unique preparations - even on common dishes like a wedge salad - was incredible. Cocktails and wine were fantastic. \nAnd the boutique hotel seems pretty snazzy, too. As someone who has traveled extensively over 20 years, and can cook better than most restaurants I eat at, I can't recommend highly enough.",

We tried several things off the menu. \n\nTo start, we had a caprese salad, and the pan seared potato gnocchi (with grilled ciabatta bread). Everything was great. For dinner, we decided on the center cut filet (added the truffle butter) and the whole branzino with crispy Brussel sprouts. Every bite was amazing. All ingredients are locally sourced.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was great, plus we were able to get a table in front of the kitchen which was an experience within itself. Plus, John, our server, was great. Very knowledgeable and friendly, plus he helped us with every picture taken.",

The charred octopus was fantastic. \n\nThe Moroccan Chicken was tender and flavorful. My son enjoyed the lamb chops. \n\nWe topped this off with crème brûlée and the goat cheese strawberry compote.

The story behind the entire hotel is nice the hostess let us know about the Burgess family. The vibe in the restaurant, bar and study area speaks to lounge good times with sophistication. The drinks were crafted well just not consistent the first round tasted a bit different than the second event though we got the same drinks but they were still pretty good. We tried the pork belly, char grilled octopus and Caesar salad for starters. All great! The fresh anchovies were great on the salad and the pork belly was like candied with the grits. The octopus was grilled well without being chewy. We also had the short rib, branzino, scallops and tomato basil soup! All I can say is go and experience.",

The automatic gratuity of 20% for our party of 6 was calculated with the ridiculous corkage fee included. Highest corkage fee of any restaurant we have been to in Atlanta!  When we asked JT and the manager/owner about it, they both were obnoxious and rude with the attitude of \"if you don't like it, don't come back.\"  JT threw our bill down on the table. With so many great restaurant options in Atlanta and Buckhead, I will NEVER go back to Fia or recommend it to anyone. The horrible customer service ruined the entire experience.

Everything was seasoned perfectly and I loved the presentation with the micro greens that add a nice texture to the meal.

We had their Hummus - first hot hummus and it was beyond good - we tried their gnocchi and that too was exemplary . My wife tried vegetarian risotto with wild mushrooms - she loved it . I had Moroccan Chicken with saffron rice - it was a surreal treat . Service was exceptional - staff were well aware of what Fia stands for - am\nJust surprised why this place isn't a rave !

        "text": "The food here is amazing! I'm still thinking about that gnocchi mushroom sauce & that ciabatta... \n\nLocated inside the Burgess Hotel, this cute little restaurant is definitely one of my new favorites in Atlanta. \n\nHaving gone with a group, we were able to order various items and they were all great, some outstanding than others. \n\nAppetizers:\n- Pan seared potato gnocchi\n- Grilled ciabatta\n- Charred octopus\n- Caprese salad\n\nMy entree:\n- Bone-in short rib\n\nSides:\n- Crispy brussels sprouts\n- Grilled broccolini \n\nDessert:\n- Goat cheese & local honey panna cotta\n- Bananas foster\n- Vanilla creme brulee\n- Key lime tart \n\nIt's hard to pick as everything was really delicious, full of flavor. But my favorites would have to be the gnocchi (that sauce!), ciabatta (def recommend dipping in the gnocchi sauce), and brussels sprouts. Oh, can't forget the short rib - it was a thing of beauty. Believe they said it was cooked over 72 hours? Or something like that, and the meat was so. tender. Service was great, as well.\n\nFor the drinks, started off with the Gin Gin Gimlet, had some Pinot noir, but had to go back to the gimlet, it was just the right amount of tartness & sweetness. \n\nCan't wait to go back and try other dishes!",

I have had the Grilled Whole Branzino,  Spicy Pork Sausage Spaghetti, Broccolini, and Grilled Meatballs to eat and the Coconut Pecan Old Fashioned and Cosmopolitan to drink. That spaghetti dish was everything! It was savory with the right amount of spicy and the Coconut Pecan Old Fashioned was a nice twist on a classic cocktail. For dessert, I had the Goat Cheese & Local Honey Panna Cotta which was light, not too sweet, and the perfect ending to my meal.\n\n     The service was also outstanding! Shout out to Brianna our server who was extremely attentive, Ashley the bartender who was crafting the delicious cocktails, and Nieshta the manager who was making her rounds and checking in with patrons to ensure customer satisfaction. Great job ladies, can't wait to see you all again!",

We enjoyed late night appetizers--octopus, wedge salad, and pork belly and cocktails (a coconut and pecan old fashioned and a spicy mezcal and lime cocktail) so much we cancelled a reservation we had elsewhere and returned for a full dinner the next day.\n\nOur table started with the Cesar salad, pan seared potato gnocchi with a brown butter truffle/mushroom sauce and the asparagus with ham and egg. Two of us enjoyed 8oz Center Cut Filets with chimichurri and truffle butter, which were well seasoned and cooked to perfection (med rare). Another in our party enjoyed the bone-in short rib, which was wonderful. \n\nThe staff was so welcoming and hospitable; the GM and chef/owner were genuinely interested in delighting their guests. We will definitely return for another visit!",

I was perturbed upon arrival as I was unaware the restaurant is located inside a hotel lobby but nothing can deter me after the first taste of my amazing cocktail which I'm convinced that the coconut pecan old fashioned is the best cocktail in the city. Both our appetizer were delicious which were the tomato tartlet & gnocci. The salmon was good as well but not as delicious as the appetizers. To my dismay the Japanese wagyu had been substituted for Australian beef however I was still impressed & I can't wait to return",

I've been to Fia before and enjoyed it each time, but after last night, I felt it was time to show my appreciation. It's definitely going to be on our short list of repeat restaurants.\n\nThe food is amazing. I don't want to go into the minutia of each dish but we ordered just about every appetizer and wish we had ordered the missing ones. You cannot go wrong. The decor transports you to exotic lands and despite being all this, you still feel like you are at a family owned intimate eatery where everyone really cares. It's obvious the staff has a lot of pride in what they do and the restaurant they work at. Are you one of those people like me who wonders \"what has happened to customer service\"? Well, Fia remembers. Everyone was terrific but Yannick (The GM) and Chef Burgess were absolute standouts. I couldn't believe it when Chef Burgess brought out certain dishes to our table  himself! When was the last time a chef did that?\n\nI've been to all the best restaurants of Atlanta and imho Fia is the best of the best!\n\nPS: even if you don't think you want the bananas foster, get the bananas foster. It's to die for",

After a day of driving we weren't interested in getting back into the car to go \"out\" for dinner. We grabbed a bar table at Fia in the lobby area. \nThe restaurant was very busy. This is always a promising sign, but can also lead to less stellar experiences with service: TBD... I saw many parties come and go fro the restaurant through the 2 hour meal time we had. The vast majority arrived and left by car. The locals were here to try Fia and weren't even staying on property! This has to be good.\nThe food was very good. Octopus appetizer, charred ciabatta, outstanding wedge with blue cheese mousse, and perfect house made spaghetti noodles in an - out of this world - creamy Italian sausage marinara. Every dish met and exceeded expectations for flavor and originality.\nThe service was good from our waiter who was covering all of the tables in the bar area with a little help from the hostess. That being said, the busyness of the scene did translate to a slightly disorganized experience. Come for the food, just make reservations and be sure to sit in the dining room.",

        "text": "FOOD: \n90% of what we had was phenomenal, the remaining 10% was just okay\n-Porkbelly: 10/10\n-Wedge salad: 2/10 \n-Center cut filet w chimichurri: 10/10\n-Fingerling potatoes:10/10\n-Brussels sprouts: 6/10 (very over-sauced)\n-Everything was so FLAVORFUL - great use of spices and herbs\nOne of my biggest annoyances with dining out is a lot of the time, food comes out not hot enough - that was NOT the case here, and it made all the difference. THANK YOU, FIA!\n\nSERVICE:\nWe were seated at a table by the bar, and our waiter was also the bartender. LV took great care of us, but I think our experience would have been better if we had been seated in the main part of the restaurant just due to some of the bar patrons were pretty loud.\n\nAMBIENCE:\nFia is in the lobby of The Burgess Hotel, and since we were seated by the bar, it definitely felt like we were dining in the lobby of a hotel. The main section of the restaurant looks much more inviting and is more tucked away from the main lobby of the hotel.\n\nOVERALL:\nWe had a great time with some great food. Next time we'll ask to sit in the main part of the restaurant.",

Steak was overpriced in my opinion, but my boyfriend chose to get it, so that's on him haha. \nThe main thing that bothered me was that one of our sides came out late. We received an apology, but to me it seemed half-hearted honestly. When you pay over $200 to eat somewhere, you should have top notch service in my opinion. I understand that the food industry is difficult to work in, but I do expect that if food item is late, it should be taken off of the bill. \nSo all in all, a good experience. Just an annoying mishap, and I do wish our waiter was more personable.",

Don't be thrown off by the fact that this restaurant is in the lobby of a hotel; this is fine dining at its best. \n\nStarted with the wedge salad, which was absolutely perfect.  The blue cheese dressing was exceptional. \n\nMain course was the bone-in short rib, which my buddy described as \"a Fred Flintstone sized piece of meat. It was perfectly seasoned, and perfectly cooked (medium rare). The jasmine rice was a perfect compliment to the beef. We also had the spicy stewed garbanzo beans, which were equally amazing. \n\nEverything about Fia is top notch: the service, the environment, and most importantly the food were off the charts. The most pleasant surprise was the prices: Fia is a steal price wise for the product delivered. \n\nIf you find yourself in the area, make sure to check out this gem.",

        "text": "Everything was amazing. \n\nCame for a birthday dinner.  We're made a reservation but unfortunately the host told us people were staying longer than typical and our table wasn't ready.  We understand,  people have been locked down (or reducing how much they go out the last year). We'replanning to go to the bar after dinner anyway so it was a win win.  \n\nWe sat at the sexy bar and ordered a drink. The bartender was pleasant,  attentive, and managed drink orders well. The bar was beautifully stocked and the bar area was picturesque. The host kept us abreast of our table being available.  I heard maybe the apologies for the delay.  The bar wins four new because my personal test of a good bar is thre ability to make a good basil gin gimlet.  The drink itself is very simple but only stocked bars/ kitchens have fresh basil on hand. The bartender perfectly muddled and strained my cocktail to have a slight essence of basil.\n\nThe dining room is dimly lit and somewhat mysterious. It's not a large dining room but it also felt full. There is a view of the kitchen where the staff is cooking up a storm like a delicate dance. \n\nOur server refreshed our cocktails and got started with recommendations. The server went through the menu as if it was a tasting menu, carefully describing the dishes, cooking style, and flavor profiles.  My group settled on the following:\n\nBraised Lamb Shank\nChicken Tangine\nCrispy Brussels \nGrilled Meatballs\nBar fries\nGrilled brocolini\nWhole Grilled Branzino\n\nThe grilled meatballs elicited a happy food jig in my seat. The fresh herbs, tender meatballs, and a green sauce... gaaaah. Delicious. I had a smattering of things because I wanted to try several sides and couldn't commit to an entree. Also, these might be the best fries in Atlanta. So some but the salt/chili dust was perfect. \n\nThe tagine chicken was served tableside in a dramatic tandoori  pot that is \"unveiled\" on the table. It was perfectly tender and delicate blend of savory, olives, Tangine flavorings. The almond rice was a nice touch too. \n\nThe braised lamb shank was larger than a baby arm. I actually believe there were two shanks on the plate. The lamb wasnt gamey and super tender.\n\nI didnt personally try the branzino but Jr was described as mild, flakey white fish with hardly any bones. \n\nThe only thing that keeps this from a 5 star experience is how long it rob to get the bill.  We were sitting maybe 10ft from the server station but we couldn't get our servers attention for maybe 15mins AFTER we were done our meal. No wonder the previous guest ran over our reservation. \n\nI would absolutely go back and suggest it to others.  There is no formal dress code but every one from the guest,  chef,  server,  host,  and bartender looked nice. This is a great anniversary dinner, date night vibe.",

I ordered the scallops and my date ordered the leg of lamb. Both dishes were chef kiss delicious! The bar is outstanding. Great place for a date or a group. I forgot my server's name, but she was outstanding!",

        "text": "This restaurant doesn't stand out from the street, but it's a good find. It's on the ground floor of a small hotel. \n\nReservations were simple, staff was very helpful. It's a very pretty restaurant, with various seating options in the social/bar area. Our food was delicious, cooked well. The filet was great quality. Main dishes don't come with sides, you need to order those separately. The spicy spaghetti was homemade and also great. Grilled focaccia was YUM. \n\nTables were not too crowded. You can self-park to the side & back of the building. \n\nThe only \"con\" is that it's pretty pricey - you can't eat here on a budget at all. But otherwise, I'd definitely go back!",

        "text": "Amazing amazing amazing!!!! I won't get on here and write a long post but just know that everything we ordered, and we ordered A LOT, was GREAT! \n\n-Ribeye with truffle butter( extra $5 for truffle butter)...amazing! \n-Spaghetti...fresh homemade noodles. Had a spicy after taste but not overpowering. Amazing \n-Branazino- whole fish, you can order with the head and tail on or off. Fresh and tasty. \n-Scallops were fresh and tasty\n-Pork belly... the best I ever had. Grits were creamy and the sauce gave it a sweet yet savory taste. \n-Brussels sprouts-cooked to perfection. Had a slight sweet taste to balance out the savory. So good! Cooked to perfection. My fav so far. \n-Potato's-large enough to share, tasty dish\n-Broccolini-seasoned well and tasty \n-octopus...fresh and tender. Well seasoned \n-Ciabatta- fresh and toasted to perfection. \n\nOnly thing we didn't care for was the hummus. Beautifully displayed and the bread/crackers were good but the hummus itself was not a hit compared to the other items. We sent it back for another order of Brussels sprouts. \n\nOur server was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. I can't remember her name (maybe Danielle) but she was amazing as well as the young lady that checked us in. \n\nCute restaurant with cute outside seating. I will definitely be back!",
