        "text": "My bestie co-worker( we all have one) took me here because I had never tried Ethiopian food. I will say if you have never had Ethiopian food before, it would be in your best interest to go with someone who knows what to order. If she had not taken me and chosen the food items, I might not have enjoyed the food as much as I did. \n\nWe got the Meat Lovers, with salmon, chicken, and beef for our meal. Let me tell you, this is A LOT of food and enough to feed 3-4 people, so come hungry if you order this. The food is very flavorful and seasoned well. The only disappointment was the beef, as it was pretty overcooked and tough. However, the chicken and the salmon made up for it. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, loved that the food was fresh, and left feeling satisfied. I now understand why people love Ethiopian food and can't wait to go back again!",

I ordered online for pick-up and as always, they were quite busy (both outside and indoors were packed). Luckily, Desta has a super convenient drive-thru window now and THIS is my favorite thing. \nI ordered lamb tibs over shiro with rice and a side of cabbage. I've never known this place to disappoint, so it was no surprise that the food was delicious, perfectly spiced and \"homey.\" Desta is an Atlanta staple for a reason. Honestly, no complaints. Just damn good food!",

Unsure of how busy it was going to be, we made reservations just in case, which turned out to be a good idea since it had a high table turnover rate. \n\nThere's a full cocktail bar including beers. For appetizers we tried Sambusa and Kitfo salmon medium well (as recommended by our waitress). The (2)  sambusa were fresh and crispy. The wrap was huge and filling. \n\nFor entrees I shared the Vegan Platter with lamb tibs. Presentation was beautiful and also matched the variety of tastes, textures and temperatures. Although I could not tell you exactly what each item was, I knew it was good! \n\nPortions are huge and comes out fast. Staff were so friendly and really on their A game. Would love love to come again!",

        "text": "Had heard about Desta from several sources over the years, but was loyal to other restaurants that serve similar cuisine. Due to closing of one of them recently I sought my desire for beets salad from Desta. The Briarcliff location offered parking in front and side lots.\n\nAs it had been a long day, I opted for takeout, and the young lady at the entrance, Eyerus , was more than accommodating. She showed me the QR code to scan for the most up-to-date menu, and provided samples of the beet salad a mushroom stew side, and gomen or collard greens. I opted for the signature lamb tibs with beet salad and mushroom stew as sides - one comes with the entree and starch options. Selected the basmati rice to complete my entree.\n\nAll were delicious and complimentary to make a satisfying meal. The lamb was what I called gamey or earthy as was told by the Eyerus. I am happy that I still tried it and mixing with the mushroom stew side dish was perfect. Will definitely return and try the 13 item vegan platter (highly recommended by Eyerus) and grouper.",

And I have to say, it's definitely solid Ethiopian food! \n\nThey only take reservations for 8, and our party originally had 8, but people got busy and didn't show up. We were the first ones there anyways so there was still seating for us. But I was surprised walking in that the dining area was so small! I thought it was going to be a lot bigger, but nope. Their outdoor seating is where bulk of the seating is at. \n\nFood wise, Desta is the place to go if you're ITP for Ethiopian food. Injera was plentiful, but I wished there was more lamb/meat. I was surprised there wasn't as much, but then again we went during lunch so that might have been different portion sizes. \n\nOverall Desta is great. I would definitely recommend people who have never had Ethiopian and is nearby to go and try new cuisines.",

        "text": "I really enjoy coming to original Desta Ethiopian restaurant on Briarcliff. Desta is small but they developed patio seating with fans, still hot though if you're attending during the day. Customer service is always friendly and speedy. I came to the restaurant with 2 other coworkers and we decided on 2 orders of lentil samosas, my fav! And the meat lovers plate. We had an order of the fillet, fish and chicken. With the yellow, red lentils and collards. The meal was mild spicy with extra jalapeños if you needed it. But every bite was simply a burst of savory deliciousness. Highly recommend.",

Desta Ethiopian Kitchen offers up a phenomenal experience at a very reasonable price point. \n\nThe service was very helpful and friendly. They made some great recommendations (shoutout the beets and potato salad callout).\n\nI had the salmon entree with beet and potato salad and rice. The salmon was so flavorful, and it was cooked perfectly. The seasoning was on point! \n\nThe beet and potato salad was also phenomenal. The beet flavor is subtle but pairs great with the potato. Finally, the rice was cooked well and definitely belonged on the plate. \n\nSo excited to return here real soon.",

It's delicious.\n\nI recommend getting one of the tibs platters for lunch or dinner. All of the sides are delicious, but ask for recommendations if there are certain flavors you don't like. All items were fresh even though we arrived near the end of their day. Our waitress helped maximize the balance of dishes our kids would enjoy (less spicy) and the adults would enjoy. I recommend ordering extra injera if in a group, and getting everything in a single platter to share and explore together.\n\nThe inside was lively and a little loud, so my little guys asked to move to the patio. The staff was accommodating and moved us to a great table next to the tree that grows through the deck. The fresh air on a cool, late spring evening added to the ambiance. The kids loved the patio and staff kept encouraging them to walk around and explore before food arrived. The staff made it feel like a family gathering more than a visit to a restaurant.\n\nI can't wait to get back to Desta soon.",

As for the sides, my favorite is the red lentils. They are very flavorful. I also get the traditional Ethiopia bread which is injira.

        "text": "After driving more than 5 hours, we finally made it to the city of Atlanta! Being that my friend and I were nearly exhausted and hungry, we decided to settle on something delicious and close by. After looking around we decided to be adventurous, and go to Desta's Ethopian Kitchen! \n\nGoing in, the place had a cool atmosphere, and we decided to sit outside by the heat lamps. For dinner, we did the meat lovers platter and got 1x lamb, 1x grouper, and 1x chicken with are sides being the ater (red lentils), miser (collard greens), beets & potatoes, Injera rice, and teef injera (towel flat bread). \n\nMoving on with my review, the food for the most part was pretty good, but it could use some tweaking. \n\nAs for what we liked; the sides were ALL incredible! Really loved the aromatic spices, and garlickly flavor of the collard greens, lentils, and even the rice. I also like how you cup food in the teef injera for a delicious food combo! \n\nAs what could use improvement: Although, the fish, and other meats for that matter, contrasted nicely with the sauteed veggies its tossed in, there wasn't the same level of fragant spices and salt as were in the side dishes we tasted above. If there was a way to incorporate this into the main entrees, my rating would be much higher. \n\nDespite my criticism above, the entree was a great value for your buck. Also, service was friendly, and quick. \n\nFinal verdict is 3.5/5",

We sat on the front porch which was covered and well lit with good music! The service was very friendly and helpful. I got the breakfast fowl with scrambled eggs and coffee... it was AMAZING. I never thought I would want to eat beans for breakfast but I am so glad I tried it. The lamb sandwich was so flavorful (I kept stealing bites). Definitely will come back again next time I'm in Atlanta!!",

        "text": "Having never tried Ethiopian food before, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was curious though, and after reading reviews, decided to try it. We sat in the smaller bar area, where Ikram took great care of us. We ordered a few dishes intending on sharing to experience as much of the menu as possible. We began our meal with the Beef Sambusa. It was so flavorful. And the ground beef was cooked to perfection. For our mains we ordered Potato Stew with Injera, and Filet mignon tibs with Cabbage and Rice. The Injera was my favorite. It's hard to describe based on taste and texture - you have to try it for yourself. I imagine that not everyone will enjoy it - but we did. I can't wait to go back! A slice of lemon cake was a refreshing way to finish our meal. Make sure you have a QR code reader on your phone, as you'll need it to look at the menu.",

From the moment you step inside, you are greeted with warm hospitality, and the service is attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nThe menu is extensive, and the food is authentic and delicious. The lamb, rice, and potatoes dish is a standout, with perfectly cooked lamb that is tender and flavorful, and the rice and potatoes are seasoned to perfection. The potato salad mixed with beets is a unique and refreshing twist on a classic dish, and it's the perfect complement to any meal.\n\nWhat sets Desta apart is the level of customization they offer. They are happy to accommodate dietary restrictions and preferences, and the server was extremely helpful in guiding me through the menu to find the perfect dish. The portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable, making it an excellent value for the quality of food and service.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for an exceptional Ethiopian dining experience, Desta is the place to go. With delicious food, attentive service, and a welcoming atmosphere, it's a must-visit for anyone who loves great food and a great dining experience.",

        "text": "Been coming here for years and years and it is fantastic! To give you an idea of how good the place is, my mother swore she could not stand Ethiopian food until the day she accidentally ate my leftover Desta.\n\nMy go to is the tibs, and I recommend the lamb or steak, although all of them are excellent. The combination of meat, veggies, and spices is mouthwatering.\nIf you're with some friends, sharing is the way to go, so get a few different ones and try them out. I also recommend trying the different side dishes, my favorite is the miser followed by the Gomen, but it's also exciting to mix and match the different meats with the sides and loading them onto your bread of choice. In terms of bread, I always go with injera, but it is somewhat acquired taste. Spongy and slightly sour, it soaks up the sauces and makes it easy to wrap up the meat and veggies. But the pita is a good option for those who don't like injera.\n\nIn terms less meaty options, it's a easy to do a veggie platter and load up on a few sides, but I'd also recommend the foul. It's hearty but nowhere near as big as a tibs plate, and I it may be the tastiest bean dish I've ever had!\n\nThe biggest downside is that Desta is no secret in Atlanta, so there can be quite a wait, especially during peak times. But it's worth it.",

The food is authentic so be ready to eat with people you trust since there will be cross contamination and be sure you and your guests have clean hands because your hands are your silverware. My cousin and I split the Meat Lovers. We ordered the salmon appetizer but it came out the same time as the food so we basically had 4 proteins. We were starving when we got here. In all I honestly think 3-4 people could have ate the Meat Lovers and salmon appetizer. We had the Ethiopian beer. It's very light tasting with a little hop. I recommend the Miser as a side. It is a tomato lentil dip. Unfortunately they don't have menus. You have to use the QR code so it was a little inconvenient to google their authentic sides I.e. miser.",

We actually both preferred the lentils over the beef.\n\nFor our entree: we order the meat signature entree platter which came with three meats. We selected the ribeye, salmon and filet mignon. For our sides we ordered the potato stew and cabbage with injera and pita bread. We were disappointed because they were out of lamb and short ribs that day. So we decided to go with the recommendation of our waitress Betty.\n\nAs far as our waitress Betty is concerned, she was just okay. She never came back around to fill up our water or ask us about our food and if we needed anything.\nThe food was mediocre. It was not as flavorful as we had hope. So we give the overall experience three stars.",

I had the breakfast platter which included kinche, scrambled eggs, and chechebsa. I also added the fir fir because why not. The scrambled eggs were spicy and reminded me of egg burji in India.\n\nMy friend had the fish tibs which he enjoyed. The service was as usual, nice and quick.\n\nAll in all, I had a great experience at this Ethiopian restaurant and would definitely go there again. The food is always tasty and the service is always friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some delicious Ethiopian food.",
