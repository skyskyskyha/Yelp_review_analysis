        "text": "We visited Torched Hop Brewing a few weeks ago to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday. The parking lot is located on the left side of the restaurant in the residential garage for free, which is ALWAYS a plus when you're in Atlanta. \n\nThis spot is kid-friendly and has games to help you occupy your time (and give the kids and adults something to do). The upstairs area has a section with a variety of board games and a tv for playing video games too. My son an I played a Mario racing game.  \n\nOur friend rented the lower section of the restaurant to allow space for about 40 people to gather together. The service went well until towards the last hour - 90 minutes of the event. The staff quit coming down to check in on us for drink/food orders. At that point, we started using the upstairs area and bar to find servers to place orders for food and additional drinks. \n\nI decided to order lemon pepper wings with French fries. The wings were delicious and well worth the cost for the size and flavor. It had a touch of spice (think mild lemon pepper). The French fries were hand cut and delicious too! \n\nI think that this would be a good date night spot or meet up place to gather with a group of friends. I noticed that they have a special on Wednesdays that includes the same 6 pcs, fries and a beer, (for a lower price than what I paid on a Saturday) so I think that would be an ideal time for me to come back solo for Happy Hour vibes or even with my family! Overall, I enjoyed myself.",

Their fruited sours are eclectic and delicious. Burger is top notch, watering out of my mouth just writing this! \n\nFood: awesome options but do prepare for your typical bar foods, but a little elevated. They also have alcoholic gummy bears that they make in house. You gotta order a bunch of these. Never seen anything like this! \n- Cheeseburger: easily one of the best burgers I've had on the East coast. It's simple yet the double Pattie's do it better than most half pounder patties that I've had. Fries were alright but the burger...\n- Buffalo wings; just the ordinary but still a favorite. \n- Alcoholic Gummies! \n\nDrinks: They're primarily an IPA heavy brewery but many great fruited sours, super thick and tastes like an alcoholic smoothie. I couldn't recommend these more! \n\nOverall: cannot recommend this place more. It's a diamond in an overall great city already.",

I felt a little more refreshed after leaving here, and managed to catch up on social media as I sat at the socially distanced table in the bar area amongst three other patrons.

        "text": "Torched Hop Brewing has the best brewpub food I've eaten to date. We were really impressed. Service could be a little faster though.\n\nTorched Hop opened April 2016 in the old Old Spaghetti Factory (https://bit.ly/2ShWMqO) space on Ponce in Midtown. You can park for free in the Camden Midtown Atlanta apartment parking garage. The entrance is on Penn Ave NE. If you can't find parking in the garage, then you'll have to park on the street which is metered.\n\nThis is a great neighborhood brewpub that teeters on the 4/5 star line for me. In addition to brewing their own beer on-site, there's a restaurant with good food (definitely above-average food for a bar/pub), games - board games, video games (Nintendo 64 with four controllers and many games to choose from), bocce, shuffleboard, Jenga, and more, TVs, and three levels with different spaces to eat, drink, and hang out. It's similar to Ormsby's in Westside, but I think the food and atmosphere here are better. As far as atmosphere goes, it's relatively spacious and comfortable and the place has a more polished, refined, and stylish look to it when compared to most other bars and pubs in Atlanta. It's a sit-down place.\n\nThey have 20 rotating taps, about half of which consist of house drafts. For house beers, they also sell growlers and to-go cans, the latter at the host stand. Outside of that, they sell a wide variety of both local and non-local beer (bottled and canned), spirits, cocktails, shots, and wine. Full bar.\n\nFood-wise, the menu could be described as modern American pub grub. They have a nice assortment of shareable small plates ($4-16 each), from lemon pepper wet wings to Asian-style steamed buns (bao), salads ($6-14 each), burgers and sandwiches ($11-16.50 each), pizza ($14-15 each), entrees ($12-14 each) like fish & chips and bangers & mash, and desserts ($4-6 each) such as \"unicorn puke\" (cereal treat amalgam) and ice cream sandwiches.\n\nWeekly specials include:\n* Burger Monday - burger, fries, and house draft for $10\n* Taco Tuesday - $3 tacos (rotating selection)\n* Wing Wednesday - 12 wings and house draft for $12\n\nWe stopped in for dinner on a Tuesday night and the place wasn't too busy, which was nice. The Taco Tuesday tacos were a mango-habanero marinated chicken taco with pico de gallo and cilantro slaw and a crispy avocado taco with gochujang (spicy Korean sauce) and kimchi slaw. Here's what I tried:\n\n* Sweet Mother of Cherry (6% ABV, 12 oz, $6) - fruited kettle sour\n* Roasted bone marrow ($10) - chimichurri, sourdough\n* Kale salad (large size, $9) - dried cranberry, candied ginger, pecans, avocado, citrus vinaigrette\n* Roasted duck steamed bun ($4) - \"dope\" cucumbers, eel sauce, bonito mayo, togarashi\n* BBQ pork bun ($4) - pickles, slaw, BBQ sauce\n* Pretzel-bourbon bread pudding ($6) - hazelnut ice cream, chocolate chips, caramel sauce\n\nI'm not much of a drinker, but I did find the Sweet Mother of Cherry to be a delicious sour. The sourness really hit me at first, but overall, I thought it was an enjoyable and quality beer (coming from someone who doesn't really like beer).\n\nMost of the food was outstanding. The bone marrow and the kale salad were among the best bone marrow and kale salad I've had anywhere. As soon as the bone marrow hit the table, the smell of the garlic from the chimichurri made my mouth water. Their chimichurri was on point and the amount of bone marrow and crunchy sourdough toast was generous. This is a rich app/shareable with excellent flavor. Well done.\n\nThe kale salad was terrific with clean and fresh ingredients all around. The game changer was the candied ginger. I thought those were unique and they really enhanced the salad, pretty much taking it to another level. Another highlight was the citrus vinaigrette. It tasted wonderful, zesty, and it wasn't overpowering. A fantastic salad for sure.\n\nI was somewhat disappointed in the buns. The steamed buns themselves were harder and chewier than I would've liked. They weren't as soft nor as fresh as they could've been, but then again, I wonder how many of these things they sell on a Tuesday night. The roasted duck bun tasted kind of funky. Part of it had to do with the bonito mayo which I think is what gave the bun a distinctively fishy taste. I thought it was interesting how they used togarashi, a Japanese red chili pepper spice mix that I normally sprinkle on top of ramen, in the bun. Not sure if it made a noticeable difference.\n\nThe BBQ pork bun fared much better. It basically tasted like a pork BBQ sandwich, but in an Asian-style bun. Not bad.\n\nThe pretzel-bourbon bread pudding was phenomenal. A definite must-order. Everything about this dessert was great. The highlight for me was the bread pudding. The taste of pretzel was subtle. The consistency of the bread pudding is where the pretzel was more noticeable; not as soft and soggy, holds up better. The flavors - hazelnut ice cream, caramel sauce, bourbon - just melded perfectly together.\n\nThe staff was friendly and cool.",

        "text": "Love this brewery!! This place has some of the coolest art work and decor plus they have bocce ball. The place is so spacious with three different levels to sit at and all with really cool ambiance. \n\nThey have amazing food in addition to a wide variety of their craft beers. I'm a huge sour/gose fan so I was very excited about their Gobbilygoo and Mowie Wowie. The Mowie Wowie was 100% my favorite - a mix of three different tropical fruits including mango, passion fruit and guava. They also have a list of delicious looking cocktails that I'll have to come back and try. \n\nAt first glance, I thought their menu was kind of bar food mixed with the usual southern dishes like shrimp and grits. However their menu is actually got tons of unique dishes. They have the infamous Impossible burger which is a vegetarian burger that's been modified to have a heme containing protein so apparently it bleeds and tastes like meat. (Thank you Buzzfeed for that fun fact.) They also have some asian dishes including steam buns, bahn mi, fried rice, bone marrow.\n\n- Avocado toast - Not your typical avocado toast! It has diced tofu added in. This was fantastic and a great light brunch!\n- Southern breakfast - Wow! Took my cousin here to give him a southern experience and this was absolutely it. It's got fried chicken, eggs, bacon and your choice of potatoes or cheese grits.\n- Grilled cheese and tomato soup - Just always so good. You cannot go wrong with this.\n- Impossible burger - Not quite sure if I was 100% impressed by this burger. Definitely tastes more like meat than any veggie burger I had. But if I want a vegetarian burger, I want it to taste like black bean or mushroom and not so much like meat.",

Two beef patties with ketchup, Duke's mayo (Duh!), house pickles and American and white cheddar cheese. Yummm. The fries are sprinkled with parsley, salt and pepper. Crisp and delicious, they are freaking perfect alongside the burger. The portions are really good, so you'll be sure to get full. \n\nI've also been there on wing Wednesday. The wings are big and juicy and finger licking good (will I get sued for saying that?). I paired the wings with their Granny Smith salad, which was sooooo freaking delicious. I actually preferred the salad to the wings. It's served with a mustard vinaigrette that adds the perfect blend of acidity and bite to the tart apples. It acts as a really nice palette cleanser to the fatty wings. \n\nAnd yo, the service is really great too. Shout out to Jordan at the bar for getting me some pickles for my burger.",

And the one we found ourselves wishing we had back in Boston. A great open space with such a fun vibe--games of all kinds incl two spaces for groups playing Nintendo and shuffleboard. Oh Brother Where Art Thou was playing on the TVs by the bar and that's just a great choice right there.\n\nDrinks: I loved their imperial stout--my taste runs somewhat sweet high abv stouts and barleywines, and this one felt in the realm of a barleywine. He loved his berry sour. Enjoyed the cocktails too--a really neat variety, with a particularly flavorful Rosemary-Sage Old Fashioned was particularly flavorful. They also have a fantastic selection of beers from other breweries.\n\nFood: And and and, in addition to great drinks, excellent food! We came back a couple days after first getting drinks because food reviews/pics were so good. We were in love with the fried avocado, which has a heavenly delicate coating, and the THC sandwich definitely hits the spot.\n\nA shout out to the friendly and efficient staff, esp our bartender a couple days ago who patiently walked me through their offerings and let me try stuff out since I'm so indecisive... Thanks for making both our visits so great!",

        "text": "Ep. 26 of Antlantaeats \n\nFound this spot off a friend's IG post. It looked so delicious 2 days later I was here lol. Driven past this location dozens of times but never knew it existed.\n\nThe T.H.C. sandwich is Life!!! I loved the fact the buffalo sauce was drenched and had the perfect crispy taste. While the world was fighting over Popeyes sandwich, this quality gem has been in the corner. If you're a fan of spicy I recommend that sandwich.\n\nBtw their fries were fresh\n\nThe IPA I ordered was called \"Hops de Leon\" from the West Coast 7.2% \n\nInside has plenty of space. Well done spot !\n\nHere's my experience:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CEw1XQAh9yq/?igshid=167i1xlgdiccx",

Plenty of seating and the servers are really nice. There were so many different selections of beer. I had some kind of honey mead, which was so light and refreshing. \n\nWe also ordered wings (which they had a bunch of different sauces/rubs to choose from). They were alright. The flavoring was great, the chicken itself was just fine. \n\nGreat vibes for great beer.",

        "text": "An incredible craft brewing gem, in the middle of Atlanta.\n\nI wasn't expecting to find a rad spot to get solid craft beer while visiting Atlanta; Torched Hop proved us wrong. The beer, the food, the service, and the build out of this location are all A+. \n\nThe build out here is huge. There's room to spread out, and they have many games available ranging from a Nintendo 64, to a board game library, to a large Jenga game, to a shuffle board table, and bocce ball court. \n\nTheir menu is a bit intense to get through. It's presented on a clipboard. There's a page for brunch & specials. A page for their beer, guest taps, and beers that will be available soon. A page for bottles. A page for food, and another page for dessert. It's all great, but there are a LOT of choices. \n\nPROPS: Overall great experience. \nSLOPS: When I visited here, most of the stuff that they were brewing were IPAs and Pales. They were all great beers, but there wasn't as much diversity as some other breweries. (This location makes up for this, by the selection they have available on guest taps).",

My husband really likes the games they have available (oversized jenga, for instance), and I really appreciate the food variety and all the space available.\n\nThis is a great place for large groups because of the games and free parking.  My company had its holiday party here in the downstairs area.  There were about 13 of us, and we had a great time.\n\nMy favorite meal here so far is the burger and fries.  The kale salad is quite sweet (too sweet for me) and the forbidden rice doesn't have enough flavor.  The tater tots and Korean wings are good.\n\nOne of the best things about Torched Hop is the free parking.  It's available in the Camden parking garage on Penn Ave at 265 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30308.  The garage is a short walk to the Torched Hop entrance.\n\nIf you're looking for an upbeat place to hang with friends, Torched Hop has all you need for a good time!",

We walked in and saw a sign that said we could go to the bar or seat ourselves upstairs. We went upstairs and was greeted within 3 minutes. Our server was great- I believe his name was Justin. He guided us through the menu and helped us decide on meal. I really wanted to try the Wu Fries but didn't want more fries which came with the T.H.C. Sandwich so I subbed those fries for brussels. The T.H.C. Sandwich was phenomenal! It wasn't just a drizzle of Buffalo but was tossed in Buffalo which was great. My husband's burger was nice and juicy! The Wu-Fries were sooooo good!!! They came out a little late which was fine but they were good we couldn't stop eating them. The only thing I'd recommend is having some tvs upstairs to watch sports. Again, it was a great experience!",
