The waitress was attentive and was able to bring everything we asked for, including the tahdig. The atmosphere was so warm and welcoming that we felt like we were right at home. There was a santoor player, which was a nice touch. Traditional music to match traditional Persian cuisine. In all honesty, I was reluctant to bring a Persian person to a Persian restaurant because nothing tastes like home, but he also enjoyed the food here and loved the Kashk o Bademjoon and Kabob Soltani. This restaurant is definitely on our list of restaurants to re-visit.",

I love the music, I love the food. The flavors really stand out and the spices literally enhance the purest of ingredients. We've been here many times, and will be here many more.

        "text": "Recently my wife and I were in the area for an appointment and were looking for ethnic food nearby without having to drive to Buford Hwy. We came across this gem, called Sufi's. From the outside of the restaurant it is rather non-descript with a sign leading patrons to the back with ample parking. Be warned that if it is raining or you are a senior citizen you may have a hard time climbing the parking lot as it is on a hill of sorts. Once inside the restaurant you will be greeted with modern decor and if you choose to sit on the patio there is a water feature to help destress. The menu has all the typical persian items you would expect to find including hummus, falafel, kabobs, wraps, etc. As we were here for lunch we elected to try the falafel balls with tahini sauce, Lamb wrap, and the ground beef skewers with saffron rice. \n     Prior to the meal we were given complimentary condiments including mint, basil, radish, walnuts, butter, soft cheese, flat bread with spices, all of which were excellent. Im sure i didn't know how to pair the condiments together, but they were all fresh and delicious. Within less than 20 minutes my lamb wrap was served with pita bread, tomatoes, purple onions, ground lamb spiced with mint and a side salad. The lamb was succulent, fresh, spiced well and generous portions. I was only able to eat half the wrap and took the second half home for dinner. \n      My wife had the ground beef skewers with saffron rice. Again the portion sizes were generous and the meat seasoned well. The saffron rice truthfully was a bit disappointing and did not have much flavor, but was cooked perfectly and not sticky. \n     Regarding the price I would say it is fairly priced for the portion size and quality of ingredients. For two people with tip our meal was 39 dollars.  We would recommend this establishment for anyone who hasn't been yet. I would suggest going around lunch if on a budget.",

The dishes take you on a unique journey of flavors, textures and tastes to a land most know little about. The grilled kabobs are just perfect and you can't go wrong with beef, lamb, chicken or filet. But explore the rest of the menu and try the Fesenjoon, lamb shank or zereshk polo. Great spot with friendly staff.",

        "text": "Let me just firstly preface this review by disclaiming that I've never been a huge fan of Persian food...maybe because I don't think it's complex enough, maybe because it's got surprisingly unconventional flavors, or maybe I just don't get it...I dunno.\n\nMy boyfriend and I dined here accidentally when there was a \"suspicious package\" threat on Peachtree and we were forced into one of the restaurants on the block. His coworker had recently passed on a positive review of Sofi's so we decided this place would be it. Firstly, it was really empty when we arrived at 7:30pm on a weekday evening. Oddly, although it was so empty, our food took an abnormally long time to arrive.\n\nWe started with the hummus and Sufi's special as appetizers and the Soltani Kabob and Ghemeh Badenjoon as our entrees. I enjoyed the fresh bread and the boyfriend's choice of the kabobs....they were very tasty. The rice is fluffy as promised and our server was exceptional, but then again we were her only table for the majority of our meal.\n\nI think my one big gripe about this place is the price. At a whopping $68 for a beer, two dippers, and two entrees, I think you've really got to be rocking some great food, and I really didn't feel it here. Perhaps it was crazy flavors I kept tasting in my Ghemeh Badenjoon, or perhaps I struggled with figuring out why a couple pieces of beef swimming in a plate of thick red sauce would run me $17. Anyway, my boyfriend really enjoyed the meal so if Persian food is your thing, have at it!",

Perfectly done with more food than she could eat.\nI had the Joojeh Kabob with the Zereshk Polo rice Basmati rice mixed with barberries, pistachio and almonds). Again, perfectly done with generous portions.\nWe saved room for the Pomegranite Cheesecake.

        "text": "I was passing through Atlanta when I wanted to visit a friend of mine and she was eating here with a friend of hers. I came in very close to closing time but my service was not diminished by it. I really think that Persian food and Arabic/Mediterranean food is very similar and it really depends on the ambiance of the place. Sufi's is one of those places where the air of the place is really part of the experience.\n\nThe main dining room looks like it's supposed to be set up as a big tent for a king or something. I got the koobideh kabob, which is a lot like a kefta kabob, a ground beef kabob, my waitress didn't understand what that was, which is a little weird since it would make sense to know similar dishes.\n\nAnyway the koobideh was good, just like any other ground beef, grilled dish. The beef was pretty good but nothing too special, the price of it though, $14 was a little too steep for what amounted to less than a half pound of beef. \n\nPlaces like this always make me think that for a lower price I could be eating the same food but of the same or similar quality but with a lot lower price. I don't know if Atlanta has a cheap kabob place but I know they're out there elsewhere so I can't rate it too highly.",

        "text": "*** quite similar to my review for Rumi's, but that because they are a both good, However, this restaurant is slightly better than Rumi's... read to find out why!!***\n\nSo, I have been here plenty of times. In my ranking for middle eastern food in Atlanta, I will put Sufi's and  Rumi on the top of my list. \n\nSo both Sufi's and Rumi's need that spicy sauce. I just wish that like Cafe Istanbul, these places would give the spicy red sauce.. I think its hareesa, but Im not sure what its called that Istanbul serves. However, with a bit of that spicy sauce touch, this restaurant would also be a five star in my opinion (actually as I am writing, I am thinking of giving this place a 5 star, because even though it has its flaws, its overall food taste, ambiance, and service is worth it.. lets see what I end up feeling about it at the end of the review)\n\n\n\nSo, how is it a little better than Rumi's? \nBecause of the variety they have, especially with their rice selection. I think more than the meat, I enjoy the rice!! My favorite is the Shirin pollo. I recently tried the black cherry one, and that was also very good. I think the variety of the rice definitely give the food that kick that it needs. \n\nI also really like the bread with the walnut and cheese that they give you complimentary. \nI have ordered two or three appetizers and all have been good. \nI usually get the barg (beef) or the soltani and they both are very very good!! \n\nWhat's the other downfall you might ask? Price... I think that its definitely on the higher end of the spectrum for Persian food. \nI also think that because they charge for that yogurt cucumber thing, it should lose one star. \n\nSo, here is the debate, if it deserves the 4 or the 5. Even if I factor away the spicy sauce (which should be a given, and needs to be there), I still think that because they charge you additional for the different kinds of rice, and yogurt, and small little things like that... it should in itself lose a star... just because that with middle eastern foods, you need that yogurt with your meat. It does make a difference. \n\nAt the end of the day though, even though I give it a 4, it is a tad bit better than Rumi's (which is also along the same price-range).",

It's not fantastic or 100% authentic, but you're not really going to get that unless you're in the geography or if you have a much larger expat community. I was here on a recent weekend evening, and it was very pleasant. I had the shish kabob, and I found it to be cooked perfectly - just right and lots of flavor. The rice was good, and the grilled veggies were actually my favorite part. The wine list is fine. Not spectacular, but pleasant enough for your meal. We also had the hummus to start. I found the hummus to be better than what you normally get but not truly authentic, but the pita bread they serve was GREAT.\n\nOne note - while we sat on the patio and very much enjoyed the live music and weather, it does get uncomfortable loud. It's right on Peachtree and close to Piedmont Hospital, so you get a lot of ambulances and other loud noises during your meal.\n\nParking is valet right behind the restaurant. Complimentary + tip.",

        "text": "If you are craving some Persian food and you happen to be in or around Buckhead, then this is your answer. Sufi's, similar to Rumi's, offer a great selection of authentic Persian food with similar or same quality, which you would find in great Persian restaurants. \n\nThe restaurant is tucked away, and parking could be better. \n\nIf I had to pick one things that I would think this place could be better at is probably it could be a little cleaner. Don't get me wrong, it's clean in there, but I am comparing the interior decor and vibe compared to Rumi's. I just feel like Sufi's is not up to par with some other restaurants in the Buckhead area when it comes to interior design. \n\nFood is great. Kabobs are awesome and so are the appetizers. Whether it's lamb, steak, chicken, etc., all the meat are cooked to your liking, big chunks, and packed with Persian flavor. They are not dry either! Whenever I order a dish here, I am always extreme full, so in other words, the portions are great. Rice is moist and compliments the meat or protein well. Grilled veggies are great and not old. Some Persian places try to sell you old veggies grilled hoping that consumers don't pick up how told the veggies are. Sufi's definitely is not like that where it's clear that the ingredients are fresh ingredients. I think it's either water or butter... could be both, but hey, tastes awesome. A lot of dishes are similar to what I would find at Rumi's in Sandy Springs, and I thoroughly enjoy all the authentic food the place provides. Hummus is great here, and it's a must get. There is a sampler platter for your pita, which includes walnut, cheese, hummus, olives, etc. I suggest getting that to start off your meal. It's not too heavy or light, and great for sharing. The ingredients used for this is nice and clean. In other words, fresh. \n\nThe price is 20+ dollars for entrees and 10+ for appetizers and such. You can end up spending about 40 to 50 dollars by yourself depending whether or not you get alcohol. Great for date nights and to hang out with friends. My Persian friends enjoy this restaurant, and the wait staff are great. \n\nOverall, I recommend this place if you are around the area. Good for people who want to stay healthy too!",

        "text": "Sufi's kitchen is located off Peachtree road right next to R. Thomas Deluxe Grill.  It, and R. Thomas Deluxe Grill, are those places I always drove by, thought they were interesting, but never really visited.  Until now.\n\nI went to Sufi's on a Friday night.  Knowing how hard it is to make a left turn on Peachtree Road, I made sure I came down Peachtree from the north so I can make a right turn into the parking lot.  Sufi's parking lot has one big Enter sign next to its entrance so you wouldn't miss it.  If you do, good luck with making a u-turn and turning left on Peachtree.  Anyways, parking is free and you can do self park.  If you really don't want to walk, they also offer valet.  But the parking lot is just behind the restaurant so I don't see why anyone would need valet unless they are handicapped.  \n\nThe decoration inside the restaurant gives you the Persian feeling.  I thought I was in a tent the whole time (or maybe it was a tent and I just couldn't tell).  The kitchen has a big window so you can see them making your food (at least the bread part).  The lamb here is excellent if you order them in a grilled form.  The stew, though supposedly authentic, is an acquired taste and is not very filling.  Its most unique desert is baklava cheesecake.  Yes, you read that right.  I ate one order by myself.  It was a tasty mistake because it was HUGE.\n\nThe staff here are very friendly and helpful with introducing you to Persian/Iranian cuisines if this is your first time.  I didn't know how to eat the bread with the olives and cheese and they taught me.  It is not too crowded even on the weekends (they have a good number of customers it's just not packed) so it is a nice setting for a date night; especially with the dimly lit lights.  The restaurant has a set up for live music performance but I didn't see any when I went there on a Friday night.  Perhaps it's a Saturday thing.",

        "text": "Excellent! I went to Sufis for lunch. Was seated and greeted promptly. We ordered Hummus and sweet tea. The sweet tea was refreshing and sweet and didn't taste over brewed like most tea in Atlanta. The hummus came out and I couldn't have been happier. The hummus was creamy, served with warm pita chips, and a side plate of olives butter and feta. It was delicious the hummus was creamy & the sides complimented it well. We ordered a shish plate and a chicken shish plate. The server assistant was consistent in bring our refills and the server made sure to check in with us often. The food came out and the meat was delicious, rice was the perfect temperature. I wish I had room to try the pomegranate or baklava cheesecake. Will be back soon.",

        "text": "What a disappointing experience!  From the service to the food. The server had no clue about the menu and couldn't answer any of my questions or recommend anything. Ordered the sufi veggie special stew (eggplant, potatoes and chickpeas in a spicy sauce)...was watery and bland, the only spice I could taste was chilly. The filet mignon kabob had a strange taste, like meat was spoiled.  Didn't taste like it was marinated. The rice it came with had no flavor, not even salt. The pita bread we were served was so dry. The only good thing we had was the hummus. A young guy that I'm assuming was the manager tried have us try another dish, but by then we were so done with place, we just wanted to get our bill and get out of there as fast as possible. Will not be back here again!",

        "text": "Delighted to have found Sufi's. From the complimentary valet in the back to the live music that greets you when you walk through the doors, this is a great place. It's especially wonderful if you (a) have food restrictions (all the food, save the bread is gluten free and much of it is vegan and/or vegetarian) and (b) if you've spent significant time in the Middle East and lament the lack of good hummus anywhere in the States. \n\nWe went on a Scoutmob. We split the falafel. It would not have been my first choice, but it's what my beloved wanted and I'm so glad we got it. It was beyond delicious. Best I've had in years. It came with two small sides, one of hummus (more on that later) and one of this spicy mouthful of flavor. Also standard with meals is pita (all for me as the beloved is free of the gluten. I was not complaining) and a plateful of walnuts, olives, feta, butter, basil, cucumber and other green things to eat. Really good. The Scoutmob allowed the house wine which was a okay. \n\nI had the shrimp kabob and the honey had the lamb. I scarfed all mine down. Honey will have hers for at least two more meals. Very generous, tasty portions. \n\nThe hummus needs a paragraph all to itself. Y'all. It was so good. It was smooth and perfect, with just a touch of tahini, not too much, but enough to make it just right. I would love to be able to make it like that, but I just can't. A young, ever so innocent asked \"is it as good as Sabra Hummus?\" and I laughed and laughed. If you've only had pre-made hummus, you've never had hummus. And I make my own, but it's nowhere near this good. We bought extra for the week. I suspect it will be gone by the end of the day. It's worth a trip just for that.\n\nWhy 4 stars and not 5? A couple of minor things. It's pretty crowded in there. It felt like we were on a double, and at times triple, date with the tables next to us. It was a cold night, we asked for the table farthest from the door, and we were placed far away in the corner and it was still cold. The set up on the lamb wasn't as presented on the menu--not a huge thing, but no lentils and raisins, although still delicious. Again, all minor stuff. Nothing that would keep us from coming back. The service was very good, especially from the folks who owned the place. I enjoyed talking spices with them (I asked one waitress what the spice was I was tasting and she said she couldn't say because it was a secret recipe. I wasn't asking for the recipe, just the spice flavor. The owners had no such compulsion.). \n\nOverall, a great little place. Worth our time and the drive (we rarely leave Decatur. Looking forward to going back.",
