        "text": "We were recently in Atlanta and decided to try Ted's Montana Grill. Initially we were going to dine in but decided to order online. We were given a pick up time and when we arrived the place was busy with guests so we waited patiently till someone could help us. Not only did 5 staff members(2 at the bar and 3 at the hostess station)completely ignore us, but instead they were all standing around the front station just hanging out talking to each other while the bartenders were busy watching a basketball game. After waiting for 10 minutes I interrupted the staff at the front station and let them know we were here to pick up our online order which she let me know to ask the bartender for it. The bartender said our order wasn't ready and it would be out soon. Long story short we waited for over an hour before we finally received our meals. We ordered two burgers with fries and a salad. The most disappointing part was our food was cold after waiting over an hour. Hoping management or the owner sees this review and helps their staff to understand the quality of guest service.",

The interior of Ted's was like most places to me that have stuffed animal heads on the wall...kind of an urban western vibe. \n\nThe bartender quickly gave us menus and I was about to order a beer when my friend ordered a sangria. I quickly ordered the same and we had some minor conversation while our drinks were made.\n\nLet me just say, that was one of the best sangrias I've ever had! I can't comment on the food, or any other beverages except the sangria, but it was absolutely worth a 5 star rating for me! Good job!",

This was our first time at Ted's and we could not have been more pleased with the quality of our steak and sides!!!!

They were able to accommodate us quickly in a packed restaurant. We made reservations which I recommend. The wait for food was a little longer than normal, but not unexpected. We ordered the Skinny Dip Buffalo burger... with a side of roasted broccoli. It was the perfect lean and green meal. A perfectly seasoned and cooked, tender bison patty topped with avocado. Served with a colorful and delicious kale salad. It was all delicious. I recommend for healthy eats and good service in downtown Atlanta.  The restaurant is classy and with a great atmosphere, too.",

We actually arrived 20 min prior and they told us the table for us was almost done. They were having deserts and pay bill, so looking good.  Then 20 min later they said they weren't leaving and if we would be willing to split the party of 10 into 2 tables...which we agreed to.  Then 15 min later they told me they didn't have tables ready as the splitting was a possibility.  All this while they rotate the maitre de's. So was agrees and the others just disagrees.  After 90 min of arriving they finally sat us at a table.  There were so many empty tables we were surprised we had to wait that long.  Then we ordered drinks and the when we reminded the waiter 1 was missing he somewhat snapped at us that they were understaffed and only had 1 bartender attending the whole restaurant.   The food was good, but I was severely embarrassed as I took out very important customers  and the restaurant made me look like complete fool.  Never again for business.",

The bergamot sugar rum was the topper.\nOur waiter Jeff was spot on he checked in with us but let us have time to hangout and enjoy the night. The steak was amazing. It was perfectly marbled and cooked to a perfect med-rare. I are the whole thing and then had my sides, didn't finish them but it was all about the steak. For dessert we had another margarita, it was better then dessert, that maybe the tequila talking. If you're on the fence, get off the fence and go now.",

This Waitress was as nice as a waitress could possibly be. \n\nShe says you will never have a better Buffalo Burger than the one here.  She Says all the Buffalo is from Ted's farm in Montana.  So I order up.\n\nBut then, I am sitting there with my Beer thinking?...they actually drive Buffalo from Montana to Atlanta?  and when it gets here, where do they keep all the Buffalo?  Is there a pen in the back of the restaurant?  \n\nI just decided I am not going to dwell on this and just enjoy the meal.\n\nAnd I will tell you---that was the Best Buffalo Burger I have ever had.  \n\nI would definitely come back here next time in the area.\n\nBut I still want to know?...Where do they keep the Buffalo?\n\nIt may be a secret?",

The flavor was fantastic, perfectly cooked, and the toppings were piled on. My jalapeños were fresh, not pickled, and the French fries were hot and fresh. I will say I had a perfect view of the French fry process & dessert prep by sitting at the bar by the kitchen, and the others in my group a couple of stools down got to watch the incredibly efficient and fun group cooking in the kitchen.\n\nI have yet to try a dessert, but we're supposed to go back tonight...",

        "text": "Ok, I've heard good things.  Unfortunately, they were true.  Maybe it's this location.   This was a train wreck. \n\nFirst, you arrive to an empty host stand.  When what appears to be the service staff arrives to make sense of the stack of people, you might get a seat within 15 min of your reservation.  Not the fault of the server, this really shouldn't be their role.  But this started things off in the wrong foot. \n\nNext, you are shuffled through a dining room that has about 3 too many tables making it almost impossible to navigate through without infringing upon those already sitting at these tables.  \n\nNow the food.  It just was not good.  We started with nachos, and they were decent. They raised this beyond a 1 star review.  Tasty, lots of chips burrows under the toppings.   One in the party had the chicken tensor salad and it was quite good.  He commented on the chicken actually making a large appearance with the salad. Typically that's an afterthought. The rest of the table had bison burgers.  All were bland and overcooked.  In fact, we were commenting about how they sat like bricks all afternoon in our bellies.  The onion rings that came with the burgers were good. Could've been hotter, but they were good.  The fries however, we simply too old to have any impact. \n\nOur server was a good dude. He tried his best.  The service was not good, but that was due to the server having to many tables, along with his occasional host duties.  \n\nIt's a popular place down there, but I'd take a hard pass.",

It was a Thursday night and I called ahead and was told we just had to show up and put our names on a waiting list.  When we arrived the woman at the front told us the wait would be approximately 45 minutes or so and we agreed to wait and she put us on the list.  After one hour I went to the front to check on our status and was told there were 13 people ahead of us and it would be another 30 minutes.  I waited 30 more minutes and went back to the front where a different woman advised there were still 12 people ahead of us.  When I questioned how that was possible as were were told 45+ minutes and it was now double that amount of time she replied in a very nasty tone that she cannot control how long people stay at their table.  We decided to eat at the bar but when our meal came (30 minutes later) my steak was so tough and full of grizzle and fat that I could only eat half of it.  It was a terrible experience.  The only good thing was the bartenders were very nice.",

        "text": "First time in Atlanta and decided to try this local place- the food was pretty delicious but the service was very very slow, however our server was nice and attentive. The restaurant does take reservations over the phone or via their website. We were told we do not need one for that night and still ended up waiting for at least 20 minutes. The restaurant was very busy on a Tuesday. Crab cakes very super fresh and flavorful, so was the guacamole. The shrimp on ciabatta toast were perfectly cooked and buttery, nicely paired with some zesty  arugula salad for a perfect bite. I have had bison before but never as a steak and let me tell you it was absolutely phenomenal! Perfect medium rare, juicy, every bite melted in my mouth. The sides were okay, snickerdoodle cookie for dessert  was a perfect ending to a great meal.",

We had a reservation for 8pm, but we didn't get seated until about 8:30, and then it took about 20 minutes and a lot of asking to get a server's attention. By the time we got water and ordered, it was about an hour past our reservation time. \n\n- Bison nachos: bison chili, nacho toppings - pretty good for sharing \n- Onion rings: they seemed to forget about this order, but when it did come after we asked again for it, it was a generous portion of large onion rings. The batter was pretty good \n- Big sky grilled salad: I liked the bison burger option for protein, but it was otherwise just a standard salad. Definitely ask for some mustard for the burger \n- Kahlua fudge brownie: pretty good brownie, not too sweet, topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and a kahlua sauce \n- Berry cheesecake: fairly light \n\nThe food wasn't bad, but I can't remember the last time I experienced such lack of service. It took forever to get the server's attention even to pay the bill, and no one seemed to care about how long we were waiting without service at various points in the meal. No real apologies for the forgotten onion rings, either.",

The website  made it easy to order and the restaurant was literally 2 minutes away from our hotel.\n When I arrived I made contact with the bartender and he went to check on my order. Said we were waiting on onion rings. Ten minutes later I was still waiting. I approached another bartender and she assured me that her coworker was getting my order. Alas, he was not. So I took the initiative and went to the pick up window and got the food myself.  Was I upset? No. The place was absolutely packed and i considered myself lucky to had even been served within 15 minutes. Even if I had to serve myself. \nAs far as the food was concerned. Excellent. My wife enjoyed her gluten-free option and I had no complaints. Only gripe was that there were no condiments included. \nWould definitely recommend. Our bill... $40",
