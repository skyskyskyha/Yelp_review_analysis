So this time we decided to stay and see what the buzz was about. They don't have a conventional system to keep up with waiting. they just have a piece of paper and a pen and someone calling names. All that doesn't even matter because when you sit down enjoying the fresh squeezed orange juice and taste this biscuit with this gravy and amazingly better chicken everything about your wait time was completely irrelevant and worthy. This is definitely one of my favorite spots in Atlanta is it is country and southern if you know the difference. So the food is rich and comforting. Highly recommend the spot.",

Recommended as \"the best brunch in ATL\" and the \"best chicken waffles\" I had high hopes but our party of 4 each thought our meals were average. I had the vegetarian biscuits and gravy which was filling but extremellyyy salty. The biscuit was perfect however! Chocolate chip pancake on the side was yummy but a little on the dry side. My husband liked his chicken and waffles and thought the chicken was well spiced and moist but the waffle was flat, and didn't find it special that any other spot. Our other party members had cheesy grits were were good and breakfast tacos which were just OK. We had no real complaints but everything was just very very heavy and not necessarily special or well balanced. I don't know if I'd hype it up to others or even come back myself. I will say I loved the vibe and the music playing was awesome. We only waited 20 mins on Saturday mid morning though I've heard wait times can be much longer.",

The basic breakfast was cooked perfectly - grits melted in my mouth and the bacon was perfectly crisp not limp and greasy like so many breakfast restaurants. And the biscuit will rival your granny's!  My husband got the comfy chicken and biscuit and didn't leave a drop! We'll be back!",

The food was pretty hearty, but I enjoyed it a lot. \n\nComfy Chicken Biscuit- the gravy was so good, even by itself. Together with the chicken and biscuit... I just wanted to savor every bite. I even put some of that gravy onto the fried green tomatoes... it was so good. \n\nThe fried green tomatoes had the right amount of crisp and crunch in every bite. I really like the breading. I wished there were more slices (only 3),but I'd still recommend it. It's a good appetizer! \n\nChicken and Waffles- the waffles.. the waffles! I was suppose to just have a bite, because I was so full. But I couldn't help but finish a portion of the waffles. I have no regrets! \n\nI already know what I want to try next time!",

I've always been greeted and felt welcomed by their staff. Now sometimes there is a wait ,cause there food is on that ,talk to Jesus level.you know,you take a bite,but then your about to die,so you holler out,hold up Jesus I wanna finish this before I'm called home. Now I will admit their portion sizes have seem to have gotten smaller over time. They give you plastic utensils, this makes eating things like eggs abit difficult to eat.(pandemic protocol I assume) However the quality of the food is always great.

The menu was composed of both breakfast and brunch selections, and I started off with the egg biscuit and ham biscuit sandwiches, each built on a fluffy, soft homemade biscuit. For a particularly Southern dish, I tried the Lynne Stack, composed of a salmon patty, a slice of fried green tomato, sautéed spinach, and roasted tomatoes, all covered in melted pimento cheese. The salmon patty had a nice meaty texture and seafood flavor, and the fried green tomato came with the most delicious crispy, spicy, peppery breading. The vegetables added a nice earthy, bright flavor to the dish, but the highlight was the melted pimento cheese, which had a slightly spicy flavor and thick, creamy texture. The server described this brunch plate as a \"flavor bomb,\" and on that front, it certainly did not disappoint!",

Management came out to speak with me and answered all of questions pertaining to the situation.

I also ordered a peach pancake to share. The chicken biscuit alone was enough to fill me up! The pancake alone probably would've also filled me up considering it's the size of the plates there. Pancake wasn't anything too special, but my cousin said she enjoyed and I quote \"I'm usually not a pancake person.\"  Also, those oranges on the plate were so juicy that I wish I had gotten more!!!\n\nService was pretty quick. Place is HUGE compared to the storefront. Pay at register when you're finished which is INCREDIBLY nice instead one having to wait for the check to come. Parking lot was FILLED, but still plenty of room to enjoy the food.\n\nI'm salivating just thinking about the biscuit!",

Walked in and it was already buzzing with people. Waited about 10 minutes for a table so no problems there.\n\nImmediately were given waters and attended by a waiter. He then took our orders. I got the French toast with bacon on the side and my friend ordered the popular comfy chicken biscuit. She thoroughly enjoyed it. My French toast was okay. They forgot to give me syrup on the side until halfway through I was able to get the waiter's attention to get some. He was apologetic and It helped the French toast a ton but overall pretty standard French toast. An easy option if you're looking for something lighter on this otherwise heavy menu. \n\nI'd definitely recommend coming here if you've never been for the eclectic charm this place has but otherwise I don't think the wait, parking, or food is worth reoccurring visits.",

        "text": "My first introduction to Home Grown was actually at church.  The pastor mentioned the comfy chicken biscuit, waved his hand over his head, and said \"praise the Lord.  Praise the Lord thoroughly.\"  That pretty much sums it up.\n\nFunnily enough, it wasn't until 4 years later that my husband and I finally took the plunge and tried Home Grown (including the CCB) ourselves.  Whenever we drove past, we'd always seen the crazy long line and the small parking lot, so we never bothered with trying to get a table.  While taking a weekday Atlanta staycation, though, we figured we'd be able to handle a Monday morning crowd, and we went for our first visit.  Two days later, we visited again, it was that good and we wanted to try that many more dishes.\n\nThe food here is comfort food, and plenty of the dishes are heavy, but you can find lighter options if that's what you're into.  I'm totally down with heavy comfort food some days, so I loved it!  Strawberry pancakes, scrambles and omelettes, pork chops and grits and bagels and enchiladas and the blessed comfy chicken biscuit, you can't NOT find something you'll enjoy here.\n\nI've now been 3 times, and the staff is always very welcoming.  We've noticed that they've saved a seat taken by one of their regulars even though he was taking a while to come back.  I always feel like part of the family when I come here.\n\nThe parking lot is small, but there's street parking nearby, too.  (And if you visit during May, you'll have mulberries and blackberries saying hello to you on the way to the restaurant.)\n\nI don't think I've ever been during peak times, but I have had to wait in line twice.  Both times I had to wait in line, the line moved quickly.  Still, plan ahead so you don't get grumpy while waiting for your table.\n\nI wish it hadn't taken me so long to visit!  Home Grown was an instant favorite and is still one of my top places for breakfast/brunch (and my other fave is Sun in My Belly).  Enjoy!",

However, I still get the Comfy Chicken almost every time because it's so darn good.\n\nTip: if you're a party of one or two, keep an eye out for a spot at the main counter. Saves you time and the staff are just so nice.",
