        "text": "Surprise birthday dinner RUINED. Extremely disappointed in this \"fine establishment.\" I chose to host my husband's surprise birthday dinner on Rowdy Tiger's rooftop with 15 of our closest friends. This was my first choice because my husband and I had previously enjoyed a date night here months and truly enjoyed the drinks, food and overall service. I made the reservation 6 days in advance & I emailed back & forth with Nick, Director of Food & Beverage, up to 2 days before the event. I confirmed the reservation for 15 at 7:30 pm on the rooftop for full service (full menu dinner + drinks), which they usually do not allow, but stated they would make an exception. Unfortunately, we never even made it to round 2 of just the drinks! A few of my guests arrived at 6:45 pm to enjoy drinks at the bar, but was told that they could go ahead & sit at our reserved rooftop section since it was already available, which is where they ordered drinks. The lasts of the guests arrived by 7:45 pm and by that time all guests had ordered their 1st round of drinks. My husband & I arrived to the surprise dinner at 8:15 pm & none of my guests (18 total) had even received their FIRST drink, which most were ordered at 6:45 pm. The bartender was asked multiple times about the drinks prior to my arrival & they received the same response each time, \"they're coming up\". We mingled for about 20 mins after my husband & I arrived  someone finally came to our party to RETAKE our drink order. Shortly after, most of us received our drinks. Some watered down, others not made correctly, but we decided to try to just ignore the issues & push on to have a good time despite the excessive waiting. Almost 45 minutes had past & not one bartender or server came to check in, take our dinner order, acknowledge us, NOTHING. At this point, we were done. The vibe had been completely ruined. We asked for a manager who came out & told me that he was just informed about our reservation that day, which I felt was not my issue since I had done everything on my end for the reservation. Many of us in the party work in the restaurant industry so we were very understanding, at first. The restaurant was still almost completely empty & we were a very calm, PATIENT party so I am not sure what the issue could have been. I told the manager that we had every intention on spending our great night at Rowdy Tiger with multiple drinks, appetizers, and dinner. An 18 person check with everything that we planned to order would have been great money for the establishment AND server because we would have tipped generously on a high tab, but we never got further than ordering drink 1. I told the manager we'd like the check ASAP so we could quickly move on to have dinner somewhere else. He offered us a discount on the single drinks each of us ordered. 45 minutes passed and we NEVER RECEIVED THE CHECKS. I'm not sure what happened to the manager, but he completely disregarded the request for our checks. We went to the bar, paid for our ONE drink and left. A birthday night, with a group of friends who hardly ever see one another, that had SO much potential to be an amazing gathering was completely ruined and sadly, no of us will be returning.",

Once the food finally arrives, it's ok but not particularly memorable. Duck is tender and juicy, but put something else on the fork, like the butternut squash pur√©e, and that other thing is the only flavor that comes through.  Bland but well cooked is how I would describe the meal, including dessert. \n\nIf you want Just drinks and appetizers-- book an igloo, cozy warmth with your friends can be a good time.",

I've been here several times (dinner each time) and have had a really good experience.\n\nPROS: \n\n-First of all, the chef of Rowdy Tiger is very creative with the menu and each meal I've had has been delicious. The burger is a constant on the menu, and it is really really good! I've also had the pork chop and the cioppino, and both were delicious. Can't stress enough that the food at Rowdy Tiger is DELICIOUS!\n\n- Really cool atmosphere. They tend to have live music on certain nights. The rooftop is a great spot to hang out and have a drink... or play foosball or ping pong... with views of Atlanta around you.\n\nCONS: \n\n- The place does have a great selection of whiskey and scotches, but a couple of times already I've selected a whiskey or bourbon that I liked, only to find out that they've run out. They have to find a better way to manage the whiskey list cause it keeps happening - if you're going to be a Whiskey Bar, have all the whiskey on your list available, right? \n\n- Lastly, it seems they are a bit understaffed (maybe because its relatively new), because a couple of times our server seemed to be the only one out on the floor, which could not have been easy on him. Though he still did a fantastic job.",

One person in our party asked the server about dessert and the server didn't ask the rest of the table if we wanted anything.  After 30 min her dessert hadn't arrived so she asked for it to be boxed up to go. \n\nThe positive is that our server offered free apps to make up for our wait time but that doesn't make up for the overall poor experience.\n\nOverall the food was good!

        "text": "We were excited to try this restaurant/bar in the lobby of our hotel, but we were disappointed with our visit. \n\nPros: We had reservations and got a nice corner booth and were promptly seated. Our server Mimi came pretty quickly and filled our water glasses. We had wings and tried the peach smash drinks - those were great and why they get 2 stars! My husband was celebrating his birthday, but this wasn't acknowledged though mentioned in the reservation. The positive things end here.\n\nCons: Our server took all of our menus since we decided not to order dinner, including the drink menus although we expressly stated we'd be ordering more drinks. She didn't return AT ALL until we got frustrated and ready for the check 30 min later. We definitely wanted to try more whiskey, but since we were ignored that was impossible. There was an old disposable coffee cup on a ledge next to us that sat there the whole time. That was weird for a place that was as nicely appointed as this one. \n\nWe still tipped Mimi 20%, but honestly that's just because she did seem slightly overwhelmed with tables and not many servers. We will not return or recommend anyone else return - at least not for dinner/dessert.",

My first burger was sent back for being overdone but the second one that came out was perfectly cooked and extremely fresh. A little pricey, but it's a hotel restaurant and a unique one at that, so a little bit of a premium is reasonable.\n\nApparently the bar has been struggling to keep many of their menu whiskeys in stock, and I ordered about 6 different scotches before finally finding one that I was interested in that was also available. Keep in mind, these are menu-listed offerings. Luckily there is so much to chose from that there's bound to be something for every whiskey palate.\n\nA few bumps, but once this new restaurant works out it's kinks it's going to be AMAZING, especially if you are a fan of whiskey & fine spirits.",

The manager (Okan), specifically, has been friendly, welcoming, and very responsive to any questions or concerns.\n\nFor two of my visits, I rented out their semi-private space. It was perfect for both my corporate luncheon and engagement celebration with friends. The staff is flexible and menu has a wide variety - making it great for groups. I also loved that they let you create a custom menu and even print it out for each seat at your event. Also highly recommend their ice creams - the bourbon flavor is delicious!\n\nParking is available both on the street and valet (they will comp your valet parking!)",

It turned out that we really didn't need them as we were one of maybe five tables.

I liked the decor and vibe a lot, it feels upscale and trendy but still comfortable.\nOverall we were all happy with our food. We shared a cinnamon roll and that was pretty good! I got the braised short rib benedict and my only complaint is that the egg was hard boiled not poached. One of my friends ordered the benedict as well and hers came out the same way. I'm not sure if this was on purpose but I was disappointed; the runny yolk is what makes a benedict in my opinion! The short rib was delicious and the potatoes were tasty so it was still a good meal.\nWe had fun and were happy with our meals but I probably won't come back; it wasn't anything to write home about and it's not really on my side of town. \nPro: They do have valet parking but we were all able to find metered parking right in front of the restaurant.",

Our waitress, Sylvia, was so nice and helpful. She had amazing recommendations from appetizers to  desserts. The owner, I can't remember his name but he was amazing, came out and told us about the different bourbons we ordered.

I split the salmon salad thing with my mother-in-law, and I've never had salmon seasoned so well. My favorite dessert in the world is bread pudding, and Rowdy Tiger's bread pudding is up there with the best - baked and served in its own small cast iron skillet (!!). The ambiance is great - the space is broken up by big dividers, so the sound never gets too loud. The decor is modern without being annoyingly trendy. STRONG recommend",

The pork belly Mac and cheese was yummy as were the fried green tomatoes. A few of us ordered salads. The greens were super fresh and crisp. \n\nThroughout the service, Neicy was very attentive but not in an obtrusive way. I'd recommend this place to friends. Go try it!",

We sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by Raymond. He was super kind and made us a \"special drink\" which was delicious. Even though we were told that the kitchen was closed, he/they still managed to snag us some fries so we didn't have to drink on an empty stomach. I am most definitely looking forward to coming back.\nI don't usually leave five star reviews, or reviews for any reason, but the customer service was outstanding. Raymond even gave us a hug before we left! Such a sweetheart. \nThe overall aesthetic of the restaurant was attractive and gave me upscale vibes but not too snooty.\n10/10 recommend",
