Sandwich was well cooked and hot as well. For fountain drinks they offer Coke products from a standard machine. \n\nSERVICE: Staff was kind and got my order out quickly. One thing I appreciate is how they asked me what options I want for my chicken (bbq, spicy, or sweet original) and actually said it instead of me expecting to know them. It's the little things that matter. \n\nAMBIANCE: Plenty of spots to sit at and I imagine it gets busy during peak hours on the weekend. There's a few outdoor seating spots but the area was being pressure washed when I came. There's booths, table tops, and regular tables. There's a modern feel to the store which is different than the one in Chamblee. \n\nOVERALL: I recommend and would definitely visit if I wanted something fast casual that wasn't CFA. For parking, I parked in the Publix lot and walked over.",

But, if you get the plate it is certainly A LOT of food and a lot of delicious food! Their fries are so crispy and thin and well seasoned. Their fried chicken is honestly amazing and very well fried. But again what seals the deal is that their buttermilk ranch is honestly one of my favorite things in the whole world I could drink it straight. \nThe place is nothing extraordinary or nothing bad it's cute and clean. They do have trivia and discounted tacos on Tuesdays if you're interested in that. \nThe service is pretty quick unless you're in a really big group but it's never too long a wait.",

Highly highly impressive stuff guys! \nWe were excited to try the brunch cocktails as well but was told they didn't have a bartender until later on the day. We will just have to come back, 5 stars through and through",

I've never seen a Ponko restaurant with a bar area. But I guess it makes sense for this location. \n\nNow let's talk about the food. The chicken here is some of the best chicken I've ever had. Vey crispy and flavorful. On my trip to this location I decided to try the tacos. I wanted to try each of the flavors so I got one original, one spicy, and one bbq. Tacos are 3 for $10. I also got a side of sweet potato fries for $4. The prices are really reasonable. The customer service is great. I ordered sweet potato fries and they gave me regular fries let them know. They politely made me the correct thing it let me keep the other one. \n\nWould recommend this location!",

                "text": "Came here for the first time ever tonight. I'd heard about the place and was intrigued, but I don't eat meat. My partner who is vegan found out they had vegan options now, so we were excited to give it try. We checked out the menu online and decided on the vegan chicken sandwich ahead of time, as well as the two sides we wanted. Well, when we arrived there was a full on party going on at the bar and what we assume was the manager or owner--dressed in civilian clothes--was drinking with customer while going back and forth between the customers area and behind the bar. And also taking cigarette breaks out front. He appeared to be two sheets to the wind while also trying to half run the bar. There was one lone employee in uniform shuffling back and forth from the back of house and the bar-- barbacking assumedly and half running the bar. We stood at the food counter on the other side, waiting without receiving as much as a nod or eye contact from anyone in the place for a solid three minutes. Staff just kind of acted like we weren't there. Finally the bar-assisting employee bustled by and told us that someone would be with us soon. A few minutes later, another uniformed employee who had been on cleaning duties, hustled over, sweating heavily to take our order. We told him exactly what we wanted and he looked puzzled, asking questions that didn't apply to our order and telling me that it only came with one side. I had to point up at their own menu and show him that was not the case because he was insisting on arguing about it. He seemed perplexed but still would only allow us one side each. We said sure whatever. He continued to fumble through the system for a few more minutes before agreeing that we did indeed get two sides. He was clearly unfamiliar with taking orders or navigating their system. You'd think a basic knowledge of what they serve and what the menu options are should be expected at the very least from anyone working there. We each ordered the vegan chicken sandwich meal w/sauces, fries, and a salad. When we got home and opened our order, we got two vegan PATTY plates: meaning not on a bun, no slaw, and we got no sauce. What was the point of having us choose a sauce?? We checked the receipt and saw the frazzled (yet still sassy and snippy) employee had rung us up for the wrong thing. The best thing about this experience was the salad. It was so so good. We would both definitely come back just to have that salad again. It really sucked hoping to sink our teeth into a vegan chicken sandwich and getting nothing even remotely resembling that. Then we couldn't call or go back to get it fixed because they had already closed for the night.",

I've omitted it for years and suddenly I was blow away. You can get the chicken tenders regular or spicy. I recommend spicy, which is not even that spicy. It just has a bit more flavor to it than the regular. It's so delicious with the ranch. They also have this sweet soy sauce on the side that i like to add on top.\n\nSecondly, the fries. Crisp. Ask for nothing more. Crispy and lightly salted. All topped with a creamy ranch that goes perfectly with both items. YOU CANNOT FORGET THE RANCH. Sometimes they provide it, BUT SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO ASK. ALWAYS ASK FOR THE RANCH. I usually order \"The Basic\" which is three tenders with a side of fries or rice. Fries all the way for me, but I know my girlfriend enjoys the rice, especially if you pour the brown soy sauce mix that they have. Great times.\n\nWill be back, I guarantee it. They also have multiple locations within the Atlanta area, so there are options! A few other locations that I know of: Lennox Mall, Chamblee, Marietta Square.\n\nParking at this location is a bit tricky. They do have paid street parking right in front of the building, or you can park in the parking deck nearby and ask the cashier to validate your ticket for you.",

There was also a bar that we didn't get to try, but we definitely will be back to try some cocktails!\nThe staff was also very friendly and we got our food fast. This is a great spot for lunch or dinner, and the newer brunch menu looks great as well!",

What impressed me the most was one of the workers... he was so enthusiastic and talked up the business. He was the main reason we tried the food.\n\nThey only offered two taco selections as well...ponko chicken and tofu. I got the chicken and it was delicious! Cooked hot and fresh and it did not disappoint. We had a matcha margarita which was okay. It wasn't my cup of tea but the service in itself was great. Going to go back and try the chicken tenders and rice!",

I mean he's just pure bad customer service. Just straight testy. The past few years we've always had good customer service until these last two visits with Wesley.

The setup is quick service where you order at the counter and get a number.  \n\nI used to dine in frequently, but have been doing carryout ever since the pandemic started and they have carryout down to a science.  I recommend you order ahead on ChowNow -- the prices are lower than UberEats, GrubHub, etc and they even have their own Ponko Chicken App through ChowNow.\n\nWhile they have a fairly complete menu, this place is a chicken finger joint at its core.  Their breading is pretty unique -- they call it \"Japanese-American\" a description that's fair since it is hybrid of what you would find in Japan in a Tonkatsu dish and something that is more familiar in the US.  It's really tasty.  \n\nI normally get the chicken finger plate spicy (you have the choice of spicy, bbq or OG -- their sweet sauce) with brown rice and a side salad.  I'm a big fan of their walnut cilantro salad dressing and they also have homemade ranch that I use on my chicken that is delicious. \n\nLocations are popping up around Atlanta -- check them out, I give them my highest recommendation.",

The tacos come with a chicken tender and some slaw and a jalape\u00f1o crema sauce on a flour tortilla. I would say 3 tacos is a good portion for a meal. I love the texture of their chicken tenders because they are crunchy without having too much breading like normal chicken tenders. The OG sauce is my favorite. \n\nWe came during lunch rush and the employees were super efficient and worked through the line but still really nice and polite. Food came out in about 5 minutes. Convenient street parking right out front. They also have a bar...This is a great choice for an inexpensive and quick casual meal in Midtown!",

I've been to a different location, but never this one. \n\nThe Service: The service was great. We had a party of nearly 20-30 people, so the servers & bartenders were very patient with us. \n\nThe Parking: Be sure to get your parking validated.\n\nThe Atmosphere:  It's a cool little spot. They even had a pianist/singer performing live as people at their meals. Several places to sit and about a 5-6 seat bar. \n\nThe Food: At the other location, I've only tried their chicken tenders. On this day, I wanted something different. Since Chicken sandwiches are pretty popular these days, I wanted to try theirs. The sandwich is topped with Cole slaw & comes with your choice of a side (mine being French fries). WOW! Ponko should drop their hat in the Top Chicken sandwich discussion, because this thing was SOOOOOO GOOD! I honestly wanted another to take home. I think I've found my \"go-to\" meal moving forward. I can't see myself ordering anything else besides this chicken sandwich. \n\nI also had one of their cookies. It was pretty good. I'm a soft cookie guy and this one is like a crisp, but it wasn't bad at all.\n\nOverall, I had a great time & enjoyed the food. Not sure I'll be back to this location since it's far from my home, but when I do, I know what I'm eating. Thanks to the staff for being so helpful.",

The fries were seasoned to perfection, and complimented the specialty PONKO chicken very well. The chicken itself was juicy and the crust was crunchy. The rice was Japanese Style, kinda unexpected from a fast food stop but much appreciated. \n\nMark, the manager took care of my family and I as we were in town for my graduation.

                "text": "Came to Ponko Chicken for lunch; I had heard good things from others about it so myself and two others decided to try it out at the Midtown location.\n\nOrdering was pretty quick; service was friendly and there's lots of seating so the whole process was pretty painless. I got the spicy 3 pc chicken tender plate with a side salad and rice. I originally wanted the pickles, but when I got there they told me they were all out. This was definitely a bummer; since we came two hours before closing (they closed at 3pm on 12/31) I guess it's not completely surprising but dang! I had been looking forward to those pickles!\n\nMy thoughts on the food are that it's just fine; maybe a bit overpriced. The rice (which was recommended to me) was just pretty standard sticky rice - the sauce was intriguing, but I didn't really get much of it. The chicken itself is crispy and decently juicy on the inside which is nice, but the spicy wasn't spicy at all - just a bit more flavorful. It didn't blow my mind or anything; and besides the crisp it didn't stand out any more than chicken from a fast food joint would. I tried my friend's green beans and thought they were just okay too; they are in a miso-tahini sauce and while they didn't taste bad it wasn't something I could eat for a while.\n\nOverall I think this is a clean, friendly spot in Midtown for some fast-casual food but is lacking in flavor and uniqueness for what you're paying.",

                "text": "I have a good/bad relationship with Ponko, and more often it's good than bad.\n\nThe midtown location is located only one block from my office, so that I [love]. The service is relatively quick and you can order ahead online -- another [love]. There are some items that are pretty consistently good every single time -- a great [love]. \n\nThe past couple of times I've dined here, I've met a few people here for a quick lunch and on both occasions I've ordered the PONKO Salad with chicken tenders. On the first try, I ordered the OG chicken and the second time, the spicy chicken. At $12 for 5 pieces of chicken on a bed of bagged salad mix and a generous serving of fried crispy wonton strips, I can't say this is a great deal, but it's a decent price to pay for a lunch in Midtown. The OG chicken had a batter that was very, very crispy - almost too hard and crispy, so I enjoyed the coating of the spicy tenders much better. Also, what's up with the ranch? It is very watery.\n\nI've picked up a kids' meal for lunch when I don't want anything too big - it's probably one of the best deals. For $5, you get 2 pc PONKO chicken, rice or fries, carrots, ranch, and a juice box. Instead of the 2 pc PONKO chicken, you can also sub 3 pc tofu tenders or 3 oz of grilled chicken. \n\nI love their fries here but the rice can be hit or miss. Sometimes the food is packaged well and everything is excellent, and sometimes you're eating a somewhat soggy mess. I think this place has great quality items and once the consistency is better, I'm sure I would really enjoy the place!",

This was my first time here. I liked The atmosphere. There are televisions and a bar you can go to. This is a good spot if you want to have a good drink while you're on lunch (don't tell your supervisor.) It wasn't too noisy but it wasnt a quiet place. \n\nThe best part of my visit was the cashier he was so into his job I loved that he was so pleasant and his attitude told everything. He was very detailed was very specific about every item on the menu. I told him this is my first time and asked him what he would recommend. He recommended the three-piece panko meal with two sides so I got that and a big round oatmeal chocolate chip. \n\nAll together it was a little over $12...pretty pricey. I thought this better be some damn good chicken. It wasn't... it was basically breaded chicken tenders and you do get a choice of three different sauces. I got the spicy. It had a hint of sweet but wasn't too sweet. It was decently spicy but not overwhelming. \n\nu get two sides.  the cashier recommended the French fries And I got green beans. When my food came they gave me rice and green beans. I told the lady nicely I had french fries and green beans she said OK let me look into that. Then another gentleman came out handed me my food and apologized for the mixup. again I got the wrong food. This time I got rice and french fries but they took away the green beans I wanted. . I Was pressed for time since I was on my lunch break and I'm really not hard to please so I didn't even say anything. I just didn't eat the rice and I only ate the french fries and three chicken tenders that came with the meal. \n\nThe cookie was crunchy and decent but not great. \n\nI will come back and try something else and see if maybe something else strikes my fancy. But for my first visit I wasn't wowed.",

                "text": "I give Ponko Chicken's new location in Midtown 3.5 stars rounded down to 3. On Yelp, that means \"A-OK.\" I think it's great Ponko has brought their delicious Japanese-inspired chicken tenders to this part of town. If you've never had them before, they're worth trying.\n\nThis is Ponko's second Atlanta-area location and it opened in April 2019 on the ground level of the Nine15 Midtown apartment building, very close to the Midtown MARTA station. Parking in the Nine15 garage is free with two-hour validation from Ponko. Enter the garage via Peachtree Pl NE, in between Babalu and Dancing Goats.\n\nWe visited on a Friday night and the place was moderately busy. There was a friendly employee outside the entrance handing out free toothpick samples of chicken to sidewalk passersby.\n\nThe scene at this Ponko is different than the original location on Chamblee Tucker Rd. We saw a trendier and more diverse in-town crowd. The atmosphere was way more bar-like with live music, TVs, and open-air patios (one of which is covered and can be fully enclosed). The bar doors shutter-open to the street. Whereas the Chamblee Tucker location is more of a food destination, our experience here resembled more of a local watering hole where people hung out, drank, and enjoyed the music.\n\nThe physical restaurant space looks good with a clean, contemporary, and somewhat communal feel. It's spacious with a fast-casual setup -- order at the counter, take a number, and your order is brought to you. This is where it felt kind of weird to me. The atmosphere was like that of a sit-down restaurant (servers brought us food, took away trays and used sauce bottles), but the food was fast food or fast-casual (this business' core product is chicken tenders). I can't put my finger on it, but it felt like a disconnect.\n\nThat and a piece of wall art fell off the wall next to the bar, startling everyone in the vicinity. It looked like other pieces of art had fallen off the walls in other places of the restaurant as evidenced by the strips of sticky tape that remained. Just a new-business kink for them to iron out.\n\nPonko sells salads, sandwiches, tacos, and plates (plates come with two sides), all featuring their local-award-winning Ponko chicken tenders. Expect to spend about $10-12 plus tax and tip for a meal. When it comes to Midtown dining, this is a relatively affordable option. Ponko chicken comes in three flavors: OG (original sweet sauce), spicy, and BBQ. Along with fried tenders, they also offer tofu tenders, vegan patties, grilled chicken, and an all-beef hot dog ($5). Sides include white and brown rice, regular and sweet potato fries, potato salad and coleslaw, pickles, green beans, and salad. I do wish they offered a few more or better variety of side options. For dessert, they offer scratch-baked cookies ($2.50 each) and \"cakecups,\" individual servings of assorted cake flavors in clear plastic cups ($4.50 each).\n\nWe got a couple plates: (1) Ponko chicken OG 3-piece ($10) with Ponko fries and Ponko pickles and (2) Ponko chicken spicy 3-piece ($10) with Ponko rice and coleslaw plus a red velvet Ponko cakecup ($4.50).\n\nThe chicken tenders and cakecup were great, but the sides were underwhelming. As a whole, I thought the plates (really, they were bowls) could have used an extra side or more ingredients. They didn't seem \"well-rounded\" or fully complete to me. Some of the side portions were too small (pickles, slaw). I was hoping the plates would be more filling.\n\nWhen it comes to flavor, based on my experience here and at the Chamblee Tucker location, I recommend the OG (original) flavor. I like it the best. It's terrific. They've got the breading and seasoning just right. Slightly crispy, a little sweet, and tender, quality meat. The spicy isn't bad. As someone who loves spicy food, it's just not hot enough for me. It does have a bit of acidity/tanginess to it.\n\nPonko fries come with \"Foodie-Flakes.\" I don't know what that is, but it looked like dried seaweed to me. Ponko fries have that extra crunch and airiness to them, similar to the sesame fries served by Korean taco joints. Ponko rice is white sticky rice with some of Ponko's OG sauce (sweet) squirted in plus Ponko pickles on top. It's basic. Ponko's OG sauce tastes like it has mirin (sweet and tangy Japanese rice wine) in it, but I could be wrong.\n\nThe pickles (cucumbers) were yummy. I just wish there were more of them. They were cold, crisp, and refreshing. Lightly pickled. The slaw was par for the course. I don't really recommend it.\n\nIf I recall correctly, there were about three or so cakecup flavors. Admittedly, Ponko's cakecups are somewhat gimmicky, but the flavor is there. The red velvet cakecup we got was fantastic. It tasted freshly-made. The cake was delectably moist and there were two layers of luscious cream. My only gripe is at $4.50, they're pricey for what you get.\n\nService was good. There was plenty of staff the night we went, several eager to serve.\n\nI'd come back.",

They were playing some kind of trivia which made it a bit loud but it was a cool interactive experience. \n\nYou order at the counter and service was a bit slow to order but they were very friendly when we finally did. They give you a number and then bring the food to you. \n\nWe split a 5pc OG. The sauce is sweet and delicious. The chicken fingers aren't heavily breaded which I loved bc you can actually taste the chicken. Their sticky rice is actual sticky rice and they put homemade pickles on it. Now I'm not really a pickle fan but those pickles were amazing. It also came with a side salad. We opted for their house dressing which was a good choice. It was light and gingery. \n\nOther than how loud the trivia night was the experience was pretty good. I'd come definitely come back if in the area again and I'd recommend this place.",
