So here are the must trys in my opinion - sushi: wasabi roll, lobster roll. Those two rolls are AMAZING! The lobster one isn't cheap but I'm telling you, it's worth it! They pile on the lobster! Now, from the Thai menu - the coconut soup is soooo yummy, the pad see u is good, veggie delight has a light sweet brown sauce, and their curries are really good cause they are a thick consistency (I don't like runny curries so theirs it perfect to me). OH and the Surin baskets are really tasty, try those!",

                "text": "Tasty food options available at this VA Highlands sushi and Thai restaurant. Renovations occurred recently per my companion and added to an inviting dining experience. \n\nDining tables in booths located in a section a few steps above the main floor, which had tables to accommodate larger parties.  Booths were spacious and comfortable. \n\nReceived prompt service and ordered from both the sushi options and the Thai selections. The tropical maki roll was recommended by our server and truly delightful. The accompanying pineapple sauce enhanced the freshness of the salmon and tuna. The roll was completed by a well marinated seaweed salad. \n\nMy companion enjoyed the roasted duck with red curry. Its spice was infused with not being overly spicy. There were ample vegetables included with meal. \n\nThe selection of alcoholic beverages was vast. Cocktail and sake options were plentiful. The Japanese old fashioned was tasty and welcomed on a cool winter evening. Would return to taste other selections.",

Dead Serious.\nTheir varying numerous sushi rolls come in WAY above avg as well.\n Of course kick it off with one of their crafts (Hi-wire) or Thai Iced Tea.\nTheir bar bottle selection/ options look to have doubled since last time visiting.

My friends wanted to get cocktails, but we weren't sure how much they cost.\n\nI had the basil rolls, chicken satay, and the California rolls. Food came out within 10 minutes of ordering on a Friday night! It tasted pretty fresh, too. My friends had a couple other sushi rolls and they really liked them.\n\nIt was really easy to find a seat. There's a big area in the back of the restaurant and we were seated right after arriving and didn't have to wait.\n\nThe food wasn't anything amazing (I reserve five stars for those places!) but I wasn't disappointed at all. I'd recommend going if you have a craving for sushi or Thai and want somewhere you'll be seated quickly.",

I can't remember the name of the sushi we had but they were so big. However, they tasted good. It makes more sense to give more bite/regular sized sushi than huge ones that won't fit in a person's mouth. The egg rolls were good too.\n\nToday, I ordered the spicy shrimp roll, shrimp fried rice, and coconut soup to go. No chopsticks or soy sauce in the bag. The sushi was huge, just like I remember it but good. The coconut soup was my favorite.",

My BD got the Maki Mono Spicy Shrimp Tempura that came out in six thick slices that she delighted in as well. In addition to Sushi, they offer a few special entrees - Thai BBQ Chicken, Lamb & Duck options, with a large assortment of Desserts - Brownie Crumble Sundae & Peanut Butter Pie to name a few. \n\nFrances' panache spirit & engagement made our lunch experience a fun one & we are planning to return with more family members. \n\nPlease add Vegan Dim Sum & or Potstickers to the menu!",

Perfect ratio of savory and spice and the portion size was very satisfying- all while costing less than $15. Srithai has been my favorite Thai restaurant in ATL for a long time, but I think I have a new favorite. \n\nThe vibes here are really cool too. The first room when you walk in has a bunch of cool lights and booths. The back room where we sat could use a little more decorating. \n\nThe service was super fast and our waiter was very friendly and attentive.",

                "text": "Kudos to Ocean Wave for providing an excellent dining experience! I've dined at a few places post COVID and have mixed feelings. Some of my experiences dining at other restaurants have been a bit awkward, so I mostly order take out. I may be weird, but dining alone at a restaurant bar is one of my favorite pastimes, so I decided to do just that when I got off early from work.\n\nI've had this place bookmarked for a while and was in the area running errands. Parking is scarce in Virginia Highlands, but street parking was available. I already have ParkMobile downloaded, so paying was a breeze. The total came to $2.30 for an hour. The restaurant is very intimate, but designed beautifully. I sat at the bar and was greeted immediately. They were out of an ingredient for a cocktail that I wanted and I ended up getting a lychee martini. I'm so glad I did! It was strong and delicious. The cheese rolls were pretty good. They're a version of wontons, but made like spring rolls. The Ka proud lamb was amazing! The lamb chops were very tender and the rice was delicious.\n\nThe customer service was excellent and I felt very comfortable dining in their restaurant. They have a pretty extensive menu of Thai food and sushi rolls. I'm a huge fan of both, so I'll definitely be returning.",

I decided to try the sushi even though I figured it would be subpar compared to the thai food because let's be real... sushi at a non-sushi place is usually questionable. I was really craving sushi though and the rolls were pretty decent! The portions were appropriate, I was satisfied, and the fish was fresh. I wouldn't say this is the best sushi I've ever had, but I haven't had a lot of great sushi places in Atlanta yet so I'd say this is the best so far. \n\nI think the biggest downside was that the food took quite a while to come and it also took some effort to flag down the waitress to give us our checks. Overall the whole experience took a little longer than I had expected, plus the parking was a challenge and we needed to walk quite a few blocks to get here.",

But let me tell you, Ocean Wave was some of the best sushi I've had in years.\n\nMy favorites were the crunchy roll and the shrimp tempura. I wish i got sauce to go but no worries as I had their perfect crab rangoon rolls. Amazing to eat with the sushi. Everything was so delicious, can't wait to go back!",

                "text": "Down in the middle of the Virginia Highlands, Ocean Wave has got to be one of THE sushi destinations in all of Atlanta. From the moment you enter the building, twinkle lights greet you and the sound of drinks being shaken behind the bar. They have top-shelf cocktails, delicious sushi, tons of fried rice and entrees, as well as a good selection of appetizers, so let's dive into some of those Yummi dishes and cocktails. Full steam food adventure ahead!\n\nWe're not monkeying around about the superior cocktails at Ocean Wave! We sipped and loved the Monkey Business Martini that combined vodka, coconut rum, pineapple and cranberry. We declared it's a tiki party in your mouth, boozy up front, then smoothing out into a frothy, sweet tiki drink on the backend. It was a great balance of flavors that's easy to drink any time of year, but we can imagine sitting on the beach under the shadow of an umbrella, drink in hand. A light breeze through our hair, can you feel it?\n\nWe will get to the sushi in a moment, but we sampled a few other good dishes that included the Satay Chicken, KA Proud Lamb, and something we've NEVER tried before, Spicy Spaghetti. First, the Satay Chicken was very tender, and the peanut sauce and cucumber salad were a great pairing, especially the salad. It was sweet and went well with the savory of the chicken. A good bite! From there we tried the Spicy Spaghetti, which mimics a traditional spaghetti with a Thai flare. We've never had anything like it! Spicy, savory, and deep from the spice of the Thai chili sauce, tender chicken, and super juicy tomatoes. Maybe more of spaghetti on steroids? Yeah, that sounds about right. Super good!\n\nThe best of the entrees was the Ka Proud Lamb. The sauce was DELECTIBLE with a slight spice up front and rich deep flavor on the back that went perfect with the mushrooms and vegetables in the sauce. The lamb was tender and smoky with a delicate char. The fried rice was perfect with the sauce and lamb. What a great bite when all combined! Plus, we had a little fun with our food. We put the sauce from the lamb on the Spicy Spaghetti. Pretty tasty, we must say.\n\nWe tried two different rolls, the Dancing Dragon and the Yummi Yummi. Dancing Dragon was a good balance of sweet and spicy with tempura on the inside and eel and avocado on the outside. The variation between the eel, which was sweet, and the creamy avocado, were a great one-two punch of flavor. Add wasabi and soy sauce, it brings out the flavor of both! Even though this roll was super good, nothing could compare to the Yummi Yummi. A Trio of fresh yellow tail, tuna, salmon stuffed with cream cheese and flash fried in a moat of delicious soy-based sauce. From the creaminess of the cream cheese mixed with the salty and freshness of the fish to the crunch of the fried rice, it was one dynamic bite. What made it even better? Wababi and soy sauce. Mouth dropped to the floor, was that really possible? WOW! Yummi is definitely one way to describe it. Mind blowing is another.\n\nA special shout-out to our waitress who was a gracious hand-model, menu master, and willing food carrier to better light. She was top-notch! That's the kind of service you'll get at Ocean Wave. As you leave, the twinkling of the lights follows you down the street and you'll dream about sushi for a few nights after.",

We were in the area after visiting Atlanta Botanical Gardens, and decided to visit here with all of the great reviews. \n\nYou have to pay $3 to park in the parking lot right across the street, and then jus to cross the street. \nCOVID-19 wise, this restaurant has a lot of great precautions. All employees wore masks, tables are spread out, and masks are required for customers until seated at your table. \n\nOur server, Mamiew, was very kind. He was super speedy, and the overall wait times and service were quick. He was very attentive, and was very good about giving lots of drink refills.\n\nThe food was to die for.\nFor our appetizer, we had the Egg Rolls. It came with three egg rolls. They were very good for the three of us to share. They were very tasty, and so was the sauce that came with it.\n\nAll lunch specials came with a complimentary Miso Soup or Coconut Soup. I had the Miso Soup. It was very good and had tofu in it. I added a lot of soy sauce to add flavor, as it was kind of bland before hand.\n\nFor my main meal, I had the Chicken Noodle Thai Bowl from the lunch specials, and some sushi. I was not a very big fan of the Chicken Noodle Bowl. The sauce in it was very weird, and I was not a fan. This was my first experience with Thai food, so it's kind of my fault because I didn't know exactly what it was.\n\nThe sushi was the best part out of anything. The Super Crunch Roll was definitely the best sushi I've ever had. The smoked salmon on it was so good, and it was heavenly. I recommend ordering as many of these as possible. \n\nThe Shrimp Tempura Roll was phenomenal as well, but the Spicy Crunch Roll was better. \n \nThe Californi Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll were good, but nothing compared to the other two.\n\nI look forward to coming back here multiple times in the future, and it's definitely my new favorite sushi place!",

That was some of the best Thai food I've had in the Atlanta area. I tried their lychee martini - loved it! It's on the stronger side so I was definitely feeling a little tipsy. Not giving 5 stars because the service was a little slow. There were only 2 waitresses for the entire dining room and the place was pretty busy. We had to wait a while to place our orders and to get our drinks.\n\nI 100% recommend this place and I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in the mood for sushi!",

Ocean Wave has the same owners of Surin, with the same menu, is practically right next door to Surin; except THEY SERVE SUSHI!! I was even more excited when I realized they serve the Super Crunch Roll!!!! \n\nWe went there last night for my birthday and I had the Spicy Coconut Soup and a Super Crunch Roll and they were so very delicious and exactly how I remembered them from Birmingham. The service was excellent! We will definitely be going back!",

The coconut soup is also a great way to start.\n\nWe ordered the tuna tatami and it was very thick-cut.

They have roughly 4-5 decent sized booths that can sit 4 people (up to six if you really squeeze in) and one coveted window booth spot. \nNow, let's talk food. This is a THAI/SUSHI fusion restaurant that does not disappoint. \nThe sushi is pretty dang good. They offer two different types of sushi boats - one that is $55 and the other that is $65. Before you gasp in horror at the price - let me just say - it is a lot of food. My husband is a black hole - and will literally devour his entire meal and then tell me he is still hungry. But after this sushi boat he was stuffed! We also ordered an appetizer (gyoza in a peanut thai sauce (super good) and the sushi boats came with your choice of miso, egg drop, or hot and sour soup. \nPlease refer to the photos below - and enjoy!",

My partner ordered the Roasted Duck. \n\nThe egg roll was OK, I would not order it again though. \n\nThe green curry was great, perfect spice and nice veggies. The Roasted Duck was excellent according to my partner. \n\nService was spotty at best, I had to flag down the server several times. Loads of waiters not sure what the problem was.\n\nOverall nice decor, great entrees, we will return.",

An hour and a half is just not acceptable. We brought it up to to the manager but she didn't really do anything to remedy the situation. Some edamame on the house so we are not gnawing on our chopsticks?? Nada. We also didn't see our waiter after he dropped our drinks at the beginning. He seemed to be avoiding or hiding away from us.\n\nWould not go back after this kind of treatment and I used to visit several times a year and recommend it to my friends. Not any more.",

The restaurant is intimate, street parking is available, and the overall service was good. \n\nMy friend and got a table for two by the window and each ordered the coconut soup, a plate of egg rolls, and the cheese rolls. The egg rolls were very fresh and full of flavor, a better egg roll than most. The cheese rolls were a spin on the crab ragoons, I personally don't care for the roll, I'd prefer a wonton instead but it wasn't bad. The coconut soup was DELICIOUS! I They serve a nice sized portion. \n\nMy friend got the spicy shrimp roll and I got the spicy flash fried bagel roll. My roll had a smoky flavor which I appreciated. My friend isn't a fan of the smoky flavors but she did say it was a good roll. I didn't taste hers because I didn't want to overcrowd my flavor pallet but she said it was really good. Total we each paid about $28 for an appetizer, a cup of soup, and a sushi roll. \n\nI definitely recommend for a date night or small group lunch or dinner.",
