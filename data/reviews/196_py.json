                "text": "Holy hell. Sorry. Shouldn't cuss but I literally just had one of the best meals I've had in Atlanta since I moved here 10 years ago. For real. Awesome enough I'm writing this review several hours after the meal cause I'm still thinking about how fabulous it was!! \n\nThis might be a long 5* review. My apologies again. You don't have to read it but you should go eat here!!\n\nFirst of all. You gotta dress up a little for this place. And that's ok. Makes it feel all that more special.\n\nStart with parking. Two speedy valet guys helped us park the car. And with a reservation, we were seated right away in this beautiful Adirondack cabin-feeling setting. Our amazing server, Bijoy, was quick to take our drink order, then apps & dinner order. Ya gotta order a Bees Knees cocktail. It's to die for! Everything came out lickety-split & in order. Bijoy did an amazing job!!\n\nThe food? Holy hell. Sorry again but it was Dee-lish! Complimentary hot, perfectly baked, sourdough bread & butter for the table.  Next a crab cake appetizer arrived & was the best I've ever had. Not bready at all. Tender moist crabby yumminess! Hubs got a wedge salad which was tasty. Main course was GA trout & the short ribs with corn souffl\u00e9 & collard greens for sides. Just stop here. It was slap yo momma good. Yeah. I said it. Slap your momma good. Anyway, there was so much food that we had a little to go package that I can't wait to have for lunch tomorrow! Hope hubs doesn't get to it before I do!  \n\nThe negative? I would take a 1/2 star off for the art in the women's bathroom. Portraits of nude women in a women's bathroom is weird. Even if it's renaissance paintings. Doesn't go with the overall ambiance of the restaurant. Put a lake scene in there instead. Whatever. Still a great restaurant that I will return to & maybe order 2 crab cakes the next go;)",

Three generations were represented and we all throughly enjoyed the food, the service and the ambience. Our server was Audra. She was pleasant and very attentive. The special attention that was shown for our celebration was evident immediately on our arrival and continued until our exit from several members of the staff. They went above and beyond what was expected. We will most certainly return. The lobster BLT, the Wagu Burger and the Mussels were absolute stand outs but all of the food was good. My advice is...don't sleep on this place. Oh... did I mention complementary Valet ;-)",

We were not expecting little risotto balls, but they were very tasty.\n\nI had the grilled salmon.  Cooked to perfection on a bed of what I think was cabbage?  Not sure, but it was a great pairing and tasted awesome.  Sides included the corn souffle, spinach and mashed potatoes.  All were tasty but the corn was the table favorite.\n\nHad a bottle of Plumbjack and Silver Oak cabs with the meal, excellent wine.\n\nGreat place for a special occasion.",

I've been here many times over the past 20 years and the service and food are consistently top notch.  As the mountain-inspired name implies, the decor immediately makes you feel like you've stepped into an upscale lodge in Aspen, Jackson Hole or other ritzy alpine enclave.  There is a large, inviting bar and ample dining space with numerous tables and cozy booths.  The large fireplace in the dining room definitely provides a \"great hall\" feel to the main area.\n\nThe menu is a diverse selection of hearty choices with an array of beef, chicken, pork and seafood...all of high quality.  On my last visit I branched out and tried the scallops, which were very good and my wife loved her lemon chicken.  The side dishes are larger portions and my personal must-have is the corn souffl\u00e9; it's a little on the sweeter side so can easily double as dessert.  The mashed potatoes are a close second, being so fresh and creamy.  Blue Ridge is definitely on the expensive side of dining options, but with the atmosphere, service, and wonderful meals you won't have any regrets.",

                "text": "3.5 stars\n\nThe rustic and elegant Blue Ridge Grill provided a delightful backdrop for our family dinner.  From the valet parking to the refined dress code, the restaurant definitely provided an air of sophistication.  \n\nWe were comfortably seated at a large, round table with service from a very friendly waitress.  We received a basket with a fluffy loaf of bread for us to enjoy while we waited for the rest of our elaborate meal, which started with a few appetizers for the table.  First, the Tuna Tartare was served over a mound of diced avocado and seasoned with ponzu sauce, cilantro, green onion, and toasted sesame seeds.  I find that tartare could be very hit-or-miss, and I did not find that particular one to be that great of a rendition.  The fish was a rather strong-tasting.  Secondly, the Veal Meatballs had a nice texture, but I did not love that they were served in a thin, oily veal stock.  Even the included field mushrooms and parmesan did not win me over.\n\nAfter collaborating on the starters, we each ordered our own entrees and shared a side of Collard Greens.  I selected the Poached Halibut as my main course.  While I usually like this type of fish, the poaching of it did not appeal to me.  The filet remained soft and tender, but it was rather bland, despite being served with wilted kale, morel mushrooms, parsnip puree, and a red wine jus.  One of the other members of my party also ordered this dish and felt the same.  The collard greens, however, were infused with chunks of bacon, which left the accoutrement smoky and delicious.  After the centerpiece of the meal, we had some extra room in our bellies and decided to indulge by sharing the Local, Seasonal Mixed Berry Cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  The frozen topping was just basic, but the skillet pie was heavenly!  The fruit filling tasted very natural and had a hint of cinnamon.\n\nBlue Ridge Grill was a beautiful and classic place with a steak- and seafood-house vibe; I just wished I had found the food more memorable.",

Kind of pricey though for such a small cake.\n\nBest thing I ate was the Corn Souffle, do yourself a favor and order this. It was warm and rich and every bite was amazing. Worth every penny.\n\nAlso had a salad, don't remember the name, but it had pear and cheese and arugula. Good flavor.\n\nSince we had a birthday, we got a complimentary chocolate ice cream cake. Man that thing was huge but yummy, a perfect way to celebrate.\n\nLoved our waiter, he was attentive and warm. Introduced us to other staff and gave us lots of Atlanta recs!",

Their crab cakes are delicious. Corn souffle definitely worth it. Tuna tartare also good with spicy guacamole. I went with the popular trout, which was moist, delicious with arugula on top. Wife loved her salmon so much she didn't even give me a bite. Side salad blue ridge salad was good as well. Their blue ridge cabernet was also good. \n\nOverall, for special occasions or if someone else is paying, maybe it's worth it. Personally, I wouldn't pay these prices for a regular dinner night.",

                "text": "Certainly my favorite place in the Atlanta suburbs. Why do I love the Blue Ridge? Let me count the ways:\n\n1. Friendly professional free valet parking\n2. Knowledgeable bartenders, not overblown mixologists\n3. Friendly service from everyone: bartenders, host, wait staff, servers\n4. Cozy rustic interior, comfy too\n5. Great menu selection. Recommend the oyster Rockefeller, the scallops and whatever tickles your fancy from the grill. My KC strip special, peppercorn crusted, was one of the best steaks I have ever had in the South. \n6. Fun desserts:the ice cream pie is a delightful throwback--enough for 2 or 4!\n\nA half dozen reasons to stop--that's why this place is a 5 to me.",

The restaurant was full at 12:45 we got seated and they had confetti on the table and menu said happy anniversary felt very special \nWaiter and all staff very friendly.\nWe started with soup of day clam chowder ( could have been a tad hotter)\nBlue ridge salad\nThe scallops and filet entrees corn pudding and Brussels sprouts everything was very good\nFor dessert they treated us to a ice cream pie which was the perfect ending \nHighly recommend",

I try to find appropriate fine-dining places that we haven't tried before (usually due to being located a bit out of our way and that it might be out of our regular dining-out price range). I'd heard of this place for a long time, but didn't even know where it was located until I looked it up. It is a stand-alone building in a plaza just off I-75 (several miles inside the perimeter). \n\nParking is via valet. I am not sure whether there was an option to self-park conveniently?  You could park in the lot for the plaza where the restaurant is located, I guess, but you'd then have to walk around the other shops to get back. The rear of the restaurant faces the rear of the other plaza shops; it is an unusual configuration. \n\nWe were greeted and seated promptly. As with some other restaurants in this tier, they have the wait staff collectively assist you, maybe with one person as a 'lead'. Also, if you tell them (when making the reservation, which you'll need to do) that it's your anniversary, they take it to heart. We were wished a happy anniversary multiple times, there was a bit of related confetti sprinkled on the table when we arrived, etc.\n\nThe atmosphere is like a lodge hotel, but a bit more light and airy due to the abundance of windows. My impression of the majority of the clientele was upper-class Buckhead residents, many of whom seemed like regular visitors here. There was also some tables like us who seemed like they were here for a special occasion. \n\nThe menu selections were varied, and it was easy for both of us to find something we liked. My steak was well prepared. My wife liked her dish as well. The sides were large, and we ended up taking some portion home. The dessert was also good. \n\nPricing here is, as expected, high. But you get what you pay for, which in this case is a full fine dining experience.  I'd certainly consider returning here in the future.",

Blue Ridge Grill treats you as a special guest as soon as you pull up to the valet parking. The ambiance is an upscale long cabin feel that is extremely welcoming. The waiter will greet you by your name when you sit down and will be on point the entire evening. Now to the food! The food is of the highest quality, prepared by a chef and team that obviously truly care about serving guests the best of the best. I had the bone-in ribeye steak that was without a doubt one of the best steaks I've ever had, with a charred outer layer and soft, melt in your mouth inside, the steaks are out of this world. Do not miss out on taking the person you care about on a special date night to Blue Ridge Grill, you will not be disappointed!",

We usually start with the mushroom risotto, tuna tartare, or the crab cake. All of the side dishes are worth ordering. The BRG Salad is a beauty. For entrees, we typically order the fried lobster BLT (#1), lemon chicken, American Wagyu Burger, or the grilled Berkshire pork chop (#2). The pork chop will convert any vegetarian to cross back over to the dark side. The desserts are divine - our two favorites are the vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the chocolate banana bread pudding. Excellent service too. Highly recommended.",

It was excellent, and could not have been better, simply great.\n\nAmbiance, again could not have been better as we have been to Blue Ridge Grill several times each year and find it to be a wonderful place to have a good dinner. And I've always found it to be very pleasant and a great place to relax and enjoy having a wonderful time.\n\nThe food: it was OK, but I was disappointed in the \"lobster sandwich\" that I had.  I could not as a took my first bite into that sandwich, could not find the flavor of lobster. And that may have been my fault, as I was expecting a lobster roll with lots of lobster flavor. At nearly $30. I think the sandwich should have been much better.\n\nWe'll be going again, but I'll be making a different choice next time.",

                "text": "First the good -\nOur server, Stephen was wonderful. He recommended the corn souffl\u00e9 as a side dish, and boy was that great advice! The salads were flavorful, one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had, and the chopped salad was terrific. The valet parking made entry and departure efficient. At about $60+ per person (we're iced tea drinkers), we saw it as a reasonable value for a higher-priced dining experience.\nNow the issue -\nAfter dinner I asked my wife \"how were the scallops,\" and I got an answer I hadn't expected...\"chemically.\" I wasn't sure what that meant, and she said maybe there was just something in the sauce that tasted odd to her. Since there were only three scallops, she finished the meal, hoping for the best. At 2 a.m as she was throwing up, we learned the ramifications of the \"chemically\" scallops. \nOverall, it would have been an ideal 5-star experience had this not been the result. Unfortunately, we cannot envision recommending Blue Ridge Grill.",
