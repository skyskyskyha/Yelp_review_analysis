The food is outstanding, and they have the best spaghetti sauce I've ever had in 64 years, it's a go to place for a casual meal and great food that doesn't take two hours. I will always return two or three times a month. Thank you for a great service and great food.",

We were swayed to dine at North Italia after finding out it offered a kids menu, which my 5 year-old daughter really enjoyed. Additionally, the food that my husband and I had was quite tasty. Perhaps the best part of our experience however, was the service we received from Rose. She is a wonderful server who went the extra mile to ensure we had a very positive experience. We look forward to dining at North Italia again and will certainly be asking for Rose!!",

        "text": "We got a last-minute reservation on Friday night on the patio for a date with our pups! \n\nSpacious seating between tables so that our German shepherded, corgi, and chihuahua had enough space to lay down without being near the severs, other guests, or the dog a table over. The overhead fans felt nice and breezy. \n\nWe order the WHITE TRUFFLE GARLIC BREAD, the bread was just the right amount of crispy and soft. The ricotta spread so evenly and I didn't get an overpowering taste of truffle which I loved! \n\nI order the SQUID INK MAFALDINE, and I should have read the part where it said Calabrian chili bc it was SPICYY. I had to switch plates with the bf who got the CHICKEN PESTO. I enjoyed the black pasta and shrimp but could only eat a few bites due to the spice. \n\nThe Chicken pesto was a 3/5. I requested some Parmesan on the side, wish it was a little bit more creamy/ pesto. The chicken was cooked perfectly with mushrooms and pine nuts. \n\nService was a 3/5 after we sat down it did take a while for the waiter to come back, and we got a new waiter while waiting. The apps came quick and we were almost done when the entrees came.\n\nOverall a great date spot with the dogs  \n\nWill definitely come back with the girls to sit inside and take some pics.",

The white truffle garlic bread is a great appetizer to share with a group of people and the spicy rigatoni vodka is one of the best pastas I've tried. It's a good combination of sweet and spicy. \n\nOur server, Erica P. delivered the absolute BEST service. Super attentive and kind. She made it seem like we were at a $$$$$ restaurant. \n\nGo go!!",

        "text": "The only bad thing about North Italia is that it's located at Lenox Mall. The food...DELICIOUS! We got the Crispy Calamari and White Truffle Garlic Bread to start. The calamari batter is clearly homemade and it's very flavorful. We got some marinara to dip, but I actually thought it was better unsauced. The garlic bread is unnecessarily delicious. We almost got one to go because it was THAT good! It is an absolute must try! Espresso Martini was very smooth - not the best I've ever had, but very good. Then came the entrees, and the deliciousness continued. My husband is a french toast expert and he loved the Donut French Toast. He didn't even need syrup which is a big deal for him. It was crispy on the outside and nice and warm on the inside. Whip cream and berry topping made it sweet and amazing. The Breakfast Carbonara Pasta was also very good. Pancetta added some spice and the egg was poached well. The pasta is made fresh and it made a big difference. Even as a newly opened restaurant, North Italia has some really unique and amazing dishes. The service was awesome and the restaurant vibe was nice. We had a late brunch, so we will definitely be back to try dinner.",

We also enjoyed dessert and selected the Tiramisu.  It was truly the best we had ever eaten.  We even ordered two to go!  But what we enjoyed most was the amazing service we received from Maria S.  She was approachable, kind, warm and friendly.  She made several suggestions from the menu, all of which we enjoyed.  She checked on us frequently and never hesitated to accommodated the requests we had.  She was truly committed to enhancing the customer experience.  \n\nBecky was another server that stopped by our table to check on us and she was just as kind and helpful.  Becky shared her favorite menu items with us as well.  Becky had a great sense of humor. \n\nI would highly recommend this establishment to anyone who loves great food and great service!",

        "text": "I tell you what.. you better go and get a reservation to North Italia because soon they will be hard to get! We decided to get reservations to their grand opening and I'm glad we did. This place was superb. I'm talking the location, aesthetic, service, drinks, and don't get me started on the food! Okay it's a review so let me get started on the food.. I'm not being dramatic when I say everything we ordered was delicious. I know it's hard to believe because usually someone orders something that's so so, but not here, not at North Italia. You have to get the white truffle garlic bread (nonnegotiable). It came with with plenty of bread so 3-4 people could eat off of it. Now if you want pizza the Casio E Pepe did not disappoint. If you're looking for pasta and trying to decide between the Strozzapreti and the glazed short rib Cavatelli, get the Strozzapreti (you can thank me by finding this review useful). Of course if you have room for dessert and like warm + moist cake, the Italian butter cake was fantastic. If you want a little pep in your step before a night out, the Affogato will pick you up with a nice shot of espresso. Speaking of a night out, if you don't like to taste alcohol but love to have a good time get the Julietta. Very tasty (dangerous) and you'd think you were drinking a virgin cocktail. Overall 10 out of 10. Very very well done.",

Everyone in the dining area came after us and received their service before us. When I received my food, it was COLD! I came back 2 weeks later for a networking event. I ordered 2 mules and received them an hour later. My best friend arrived after me and received her drink before me. The manager was receptive to the feedback, but nothing was done to rectify the situation. \n\nI also told my server to place the two drinks on my tab when I ordered. She preceded to tell me that she placed them on my husband's tab. I was with a client, not my husband at a networking event. \n\nIn regards to the food, I've ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti is this weird tubular pasta, the meatballs were decent. The breakfast carbonara is bland and tasteless, the breakfast sandwich looked good, but it was so cold when we received it. The potatoes also looked good, but again they were cold. \n\nIf you want subpar service and bland chain- Italian, then come here, but honestly, you'll probably get better pasta from Olive Garden or Carrabbas..... and this is coming from someone who has made pasta and Italy and dined at serval authentic Italian restaurants.",

Parking was not super easy, so we did valet (which was cash only). We sat outside on the patio which was very pleasant as it was shaded and there were fans keeping us cool. Our waitress Cal was very nice and knowledgeable on the whole menu. She made some great recommendations so we got the Breakfast Mule and the Caffe Old Fashioned- both were delicious. She also recommended we get the White Truffle Garlic Bread which was absolutely delicious!! Will never come here and not get that. For entrees we got the Pollo Fritto (very chicken fried steak-esque and was so good with the crispy hash potatoes! We also got the Breakfast Rosa Pizza- which was so so good, but also surprisingly spicy!! For dessert we had the tiramisu and it was perfection with the dark chocolate beads on top! We cannot wait to come here for dinner and happy hour!",

        "text": "Just took my boyfriend here for our anniversary dinner and Im considering going back tomorrow haha. This restaurant has definitely made it on my top 5 favorite restaurants. I ordered the white truffle garlic butter appetizer, which has definitely got to be one of the best appetizers I've ever tasted. The bolognese was a solid 8.6/10, I absolutely loved it and I would love to get it again. Second best bolognese I've ever had, the best being my friend's grandma's, but that's kind of hard to beat haha. My boyfriend ordered the salmon entree, which was also delicious, but we both agreed that the base (green soba with pine nuts) was a touch too salty. It was still amazing and I would personally order it myself haha. I'd rate it a 7.98/10. The dessert was the caramel dessert, which we weren't really a fan of, but neither of us like caramel so I'm not sure why he decided to order it haha. \nOur server, Alex, was wonderful. He was very kind and professional but still very much himself. I also got a chance to speak to CJ as well, who was so friendly. Everyone seemed super nice and welcoming. \nOverall, I could rave on and on about the food if I could! Not sure if the food was that perfect because the restaurant just opened a couple days ago but I really hope y'all continue to keep up the good work. I will DEFINITELY be a returning customer.\nFood: 9.2/10\nService: 10/10\nAmbience: 10/10, warm, dim lighting. Outdoor and indoor option. \nLocation: 7/10, easy to find, lots of foot traffic but it is at Lenox so y'all know to be careful lmaoooo. Easy, free parking.",

Waited quite a while for our waitress to show up.  Ordered drinks.  They took forever to be delivered.  When they were, they were not correct.  \n\nWe ordered appetizers, entrees & dessert & coffee.\n\nThe food finally came.  It was not bad, but we were in the restaurant for 2 1/4 hours.  I couldn't decide if they were overwhelmed with take out orders or just didn't know how to run a kitchen.\n\nOur waitress rarely came to the table.  I could see her standing in the glassed in kitchen talking with two of her friends.   \n\nWe felt like this whole experience was a training & management issue.  Somebody needs to do some retraining for the bar, staff & kitchen procedures.  \n\nWe have better Italian restaurants in Dunwoody.  Won't be back.  Spend your money elsewhere.",

I tried my friends food and tasted very plain as well, like red sauce and meat. The BEST part were the appetizers. The bread was amazing and so were the meatball looking appetizer that didn't actually have meat in them. The calamari was average. I don't find this place anything too special with the pasta. I do plan on coming back to try the pizza as I heard that is good.",
