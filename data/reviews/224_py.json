                "text": "Why doesn't this restaurant get more hype????? 10/10 meal, ambience, service just amazing! \n\nFound this restaurant while scrolling on Yelp located in the heart of midtown. We found rather cheap metered parking along the street but I'm not 100% sure if there's a parking lot. We came in right when they opened for dinner and opted to sit on the upper level (note: bottom level serves happy hour but it's not available on the top floor). Our waitress, Simone, was soooo attentive and knowledgeable in the menu. She helped us narrow down our appetizer options and we ended up getting the spanakopita. I was nervous because sometimes spanakopita can be a hit or miss but THIS was a hit. Served with a side salad which was so good as well.\n\nFor our entrees we got the lamb shank and the agora mixed grill.\n\nGet the lamb shank it literally changed my life. So well seasoned with a HEARTY portion of lamb. Literally did not skimp out. It was $32 which I thought was a steal cause you know some places be charging an arm and a leg for lamb. The agora mixed grill is perfect if you're indecisive on what kebab to get.\n\nOverall, absolutely obsessed with this restaurant and I'm so glad I tried it out. Definitely see myself frequenting this place and even trying their brunch.",

                "text": "This was my favorite restaurant while visiting Atlanta. My friend lives nearby and suggested it, so we walked (braved the cold and wind) 10 minutes to the restaurant.\n\nWe didn't have reservations, and there was no wait. Apparently, the restaurant was closed for remodeling and recently opened. You can dine downstairs near the bar, but most of the seating was upstairs. The stairway tiles in between were such a beautiful print reminiscent of Greek or Turkish design. There's intimate 2- person seating and larger seating for groups of 4 or more. The teal velvet seating added to the charm. The place was dimly lit and cozy. \n\nMary Lyle was our waitress. She was amazing and attentive. My friend and I ordered cocktails and various appetizers to try. Excellent price points from $7-9 with large portions, not to mention, delicious.\n\nI had the Gardenia cocktail with gin and cucumber that was refreshing. My friend ordered the Basilisk. I tried it, and it's green apple forward and also good.\n\nThe appetizers we chose were hummus, babaganoush, shakshuka, and spanakopita. Unfortunately, they ran out of the babaganoush past 8 pm. Mary Lyle brought us a complimentary appetizer - lentil kofte. It was served on a bed of romaine. \n\nHummus: Large portion. I loved the fried chickpeas on top. It's served with a full basket of pita. \n\nSpanakopita:  4 pieces and comes with a side salad with vinaigrette dressing. The spinach and feta was baked to perfection.\n\nShakshuka: I absolutely loved this variation of shakshuka because it was eggplant based. It's typically tomato and egg. There was no egg, but it did have green peppers in a homemade tomato sauce. The eggplant and peppers were tender and paired nicely with the pita bread. Since the eggplant was cooked right, I'm sure the babaganoush was just as great.\n\nI had eaten a large, Southern dish for lunch, so I was getting full. My friend ordered the Turkish moussaka that came with eggplant and ground beef and was served with rice. I had some of it, and it is a filling entree. Again, it was a large portion.\n\nAt the end of our meal, Mary Lyle surprised us with a free dessert - rice pudding. We killed it! There's a hint of cinnamon. It was creamy. I could taste the whipping cream or milk they used.\n\nWhen I go back to Atlanta, I'm coming here for my Mediterranean fix. I just hope there's babaganoush next time! *fingers crossed*",

This spot has been closed down for a little while it has recently done a revamp in decor and the menu.  I will say parking can be a little tricky. There is apparently an old bank that you can Parkette. I didn't know that it was old because it still has signs up to says private property and it looks like a bank. But it is a spot that you can park at. There is also street parking. You do have to pay for parking unless it's between certain times in certain days. We went on a Sunday so parking was free on the street.\n\nThe inside is very beautiful. It's not a very big restaurant but it's a decent size. The food was very good. We got the meze platter which has so many different options to try and served with pita bread. We also ordered a couple other appetizers and shared. My favorite was the.sigara rolls. They were so cheesy and flaky from the dough.  All the food was super flavorful. And all the meat was super tender and juicy. We had a really great time celebrating our Friendsgiving here. Service was so good as well. I would definitely go back to this place.",

Since it was our first time dining in not sure if they do half off bottles of wine every Monday or just then, but i will say i had the Argentinian Malbec (Manos Negras) and it was DELICIOUS. Sometimes half bottle wines suck, but that was NOT the case here. I highly recommend the hummus and the lamb plate! Highly recommend!!!! \nP.S. there is no parking lot",

Upstairs you'll find the formal dining room and kitchen. We were greeted so warmly and started our meal with a complimentary lentil based kofta lettuce wrap. It was surprisingly delicious and had lots of flavor. This tickled our palettes for the rest of the meal. I ordered the mix grill plate and my bf had the lamb gyro. The mixed grill plate is really the go-to pick as it has a lamb chop, kofta, beef and chicken kabobs. The pita tasted so fresh as did the yogurt sauce which was great for dipping the meats into. Everything was tender, juicy and had that nice grill flavor to it. Even the chicken which can be dried out by the grill sometimes. I also really enjoyed the charred octopus on top of some kind of lentil/bean puree. It was seasoned so well and had some trout roe on top of it that added a phenomenal burst of flavor.",

I walked, but for those driving, know that there is it a ton of parking in this area because of construction on the plaza in front of the restaurant. When it's done, it will be beautiful! Service was quick and easy. The order was correct.\n\nI ordered a Greek salad and added lamb and tzatziki. The portion was huge (leftovers for lunch tomorrow!), the meat was really delicious, and the veggies were fresh. Could've used more cucumber though! I thought the tzatziki was a bit too thick and had a very mild flavor compared to what I'm used to. The tabouli wasn't great...it was 95% parsley with a few tomatoes and onions -- like tiiiiny pinches -- and barely dressed. I wouldn't order it again. I also got spanakopita (not pictured) and wasn't impressed. Great flavor but the puff pastry had no crispiness / was almost soggy which I suspect was (at least in part) due to getting it to go. \n\nOverall, I would come back -- it's open late compared to other healthy dinners in the area (10pm) and it was pretty inexpensive! I'll probably stick to salads and meat platters though.",

Also lost a lot of fan favorites from the menu - gyros and falafel platters are no more. :(\n\nThe food has lost it's love, but I appreciate how pretty the decor is now. After 4 years I probably won't be returning even though they had the best dolmas I ever tasted. A sad loss for what used to be a restaurant that made you feel like family.",

Additionally they also rebranded with a nice menu and a lovely interior. \n\nWith that being said, I expected the prices to go up, but not by this much. They need to be revised to a $$$ restaurant. \nRegardless of how good the food is, I think it lost the cozy feel and the appeal that it used to have. The portion sizes have decreased in size and the menu options have been decimated. Gone are the days where you can swing by for a small plate and escape under $15.

The bar area is super nice and free of tv. So, people are talking, eating, enjoying company. It's wonderful environment. \n\nSpirits are fantastic! Nice specialty list of cocktails made right in front of you. Passion fruit / chili/ tequila concoction was perfectly balanced and yummy. Old fashion made perfectly. \n\nCalamari is really really really good. But if you are sharing ask for extra sauce. It's hard to share. \n\nWe had kabobs... lamb and a chicken. They were full meals with little side salad, rice, & pita. I still think the lamb serving size was much larger but either way- you are going to be satisfied.\n\nDessert... if only we would've not scarfed down two courses- maybe I could tell you about dessert. Lol. There's always a goal for next visit. \n\nSo, tell DoorDash - not tonight... and go visit Agora. Enjoy actually participating in real experience. Enjoy! \n\n* in addition, they do have an upstairs dining room if you aren't comfortable eating at the bar or need more family environment.",

Because I love Cafe Agora so much I kinda want to buy it a ring and move in. \n\nCafe Agora is hands-down serving up some of the best Mediterranean food in Atlanta -- so much so, it's quickly become my favorite place to order delivery from. Every single thing I've ever ordered from there was made with care, love and attention and portion sizes are generous. Favorites include the carrot salad (I know, but trust me on this), homemade dolmas and baba ganoush that's perfectly creamy and heavily jacked with garlic. If you're planning on having a date after eating here, they'd better like garlic. In fact, that's a good standard to live by -- if they don't like garlic, they're not worth dating.  \n\nAs if this wasn't enough, they're also really lovely people. I remember once I put in the notes how much I loved their carrot salad and they sent along a little extra portion, just for me. \n\nI'm not lucky enough to have a Mediterranean mom, but if I was... I'm pretty sure her food would taste like Cafe Agora's.",

We sat outside and he enjoyed his falafel wrap and I my adana kebab plate. The wraps are probably the perfect amount for a lunch, and convenient, too! He really liked the falafel here. The plates are HEFTY and despite me being hungry and coming off of a bike ride I still couldn't finish my entire dish--there is so much meat and SO much rice. The salad was a bit underdressed but that is a minor issue. The kebab was well seasoned and juicy. \nI also like that they are situated on a side street in midtown so it's a bit quieter and you can really enjoy your meal if you sit just outside.",

While she went with this simple Greek salad and a side of hummus with pita, I ordered the mezze plate, a selection of heaping portions of various dips, spreads, and salads that made for a nice dinner and lunch the next day. Whereas I usually lean more Middle Eastern, I was delighted to try some of the Turkish dishes that were new to me, like the piyaz red bean bean salad and the ezme tomato relish. Of particular note was the haydari, a yogurt seasoned with garlic, dill and walnuts- creamy yet bright, it really livened up the plate. Cafe Agora is a great spot, and on my list for Mediterranean takeout when I am looking for something beyond just hummus and pita.",

Due to construction on the street there is really no seating for this spot, so we got takeout. \n\nI have family that lives across the street from this place and she was craving Mediterranean so we tried this spot. \n\nI ordered the mezze plate - I wanted the small but was charged for the large and was not given pita even when I asked if pita was included (cuz I was gonna order some just in case it wasn't). I was told that 2 pita was included for the mezze plate but they totally forgot when I opened my takeout package at home. My sister ordered the gyro plate and was given one pita. The mezze platter was tasty, I will give them that but not having a pita to dip in is kind of not fun. The food came out super fast, but maybe so fast that they messed up the order? How do you forget to give pita at a Mediterranean place, especially if it's a mezze plate? My sister did enjoy her gyro platter. \n\nMaybe I caught them on a bad day, but I wouldn't race to get food from here. It was tasty but kind of overpriced for the crappy service.",

                "text": "Lamb / Beef gyro, regular size (not large). Quite good. Soft, moist pita, plenty of meat and fresh, crisp lettuce and onion. No tomato and it was missed but was not listed on the ingredients. Tzatziki was flavorful. The best? No, but really good.  Would definitely order again.\n\nThe Spanakopita...a doughy, almost flavorless disappointment. Good size, but couldn't eat more than a bite or two. How does phyllo get that doughy and undercooked....other than being undercooked. A shame, I was looking forward to it as it's my favorite at other Greek restaurants. Skip this one. \n\nBaklava...very good. Thought I was done with that review? Nope. $5.35 for (2 pieces) that totaled in size of 1 1/2\" x 2 1/2\". Trust me, I measured. Now...the issue at hand. How was the Baklava crispy, crunchy phyllo and the Spanakopita was as wet as a lasagna noodle? \n\nGreek salad, minimal feta, even more minimal dressing. Tomatoes that had a bit of a snap as they weren't ripe. As we are all living with produce availability I will not judge the tomato issue harshly. There needs to be more feta and dressing on the side...when the order requested dressing on the side. \n\nAnd I ate all of this in a hotel room, with no utensils even though I requested them. \n\nHappy to give great reviews, hate giving less that stellar reviews. This place is close,  close to being good. They just aren't there yet. \n\nYou have other options for Greek food. Steer clear of this one for now.",

Even when you enter, it feels like a very small place with a few tables down stairs and a big seating area upstairs. You order at the counter with the menu displayed behind it, with pictures representing what you would expect.\nBut my god the food is amazing! I always get the chicken shish kabab entree- char grilled, succulent marinated chicken pieces served on rice with balsamic glazed lettuce/cucumber salad, 4 pcs pita and tziziki sauce ($13.5). We also tried the spanakopita which is essentially like a lasagna ($6). Service was quick, and they bring the food to your table. Would recommend again for a quick bite to eat!",

And they give a hefty serving of tzatziki alongside the dolmades and on top of the gyros. \n\nMy one personal advice is ask for light lettuce on the gyros; it's crunchy and refreshing but I find too much can be messy and some bites too lettucy, ha. \n\nThey have a $10.99 lunch special including: a gyro, Greek fries (to die for) and a drink. From 11-1 pm. \n\nTop off with the RICE PUDDING. Wow, it's the creamiest and most comforting way to finish a big meal like that.",

The Maza Platter was delicious and the small serving was more than enough food. The Cheese Boregi was delicious!! A nicely seasoned sharp cheese fried in a crispy outer shell. Absolutely yummy. \n\n* The regular Lamb Gyro with a side Greek salad was huge. The lamb was delicious. Pretty much your standard gyro filled with lettuce & onions. \n\n* Also, the complementary rice pudding as the end was delicious!",

He makes you feel like you belong!\n\nThe food is excellent. The quality is great and the quantity is generous. We shared a plate and were so glad we did!  The Baba Ganoush is lovely, the pita is fresh and the chicken had an excellent sauce that gave it a pizzaz. Cafe Agora does a hopping business. There's not much space inside but there are tables outside. I saw a lot of take away orders. \n\nLooking for a relaxed atmosphere where you get great food at a reasonable price, where you feel like you're a long lost friend and where you will leave full and satisfied? Find your way to Cafe Agora!",

Located off busy Peachtree Street, it is a basic shop where you order your food, pay and they will bring your food when done. \n\nThe menu is on the wall above the counter and I ordered a Falafel Pita Wrap and my partner ordered a Chicken Pita sandwich, both came with seasoned french fries. We had water to drink, and you help yourself. \n\nIt was a warm spring afternoon and we sat outside. After about 5 minutes the food was brought out to us. \n\nThe Falafel Pita Wrap was served wrapped in foil. It was stuffed full and was a little difficult to eat without a fork. The sandwich was served in a warm pita spongy bread, three or four falafel balls, lettuce, hummus, and a creamy yogurt sauce. The fries were seasoned and twice fried. Both were delicious. My partner's  Chicken Pita he said it was nicely done. \n\nTo sum it up, the restaurant is nothing special inside, more of a counter than a restaurant. Not much service, but what there was, was fine. The food was above average. Outside dining was lovely. We will return.",

                "text": "Cafe Agora -- decent food at affordable prices and friendly service.\n*****\nI. LOCATION & PARKING: Using Google Maps or Waze, one shouldn't have any trouble finding this restaurant. It sits in between Savi Provisions and a Delta Credit Union location.\n\nRegarding parking, I suggest finding a spot on Peachtree Place NE. Download the Parkmobile app before getting there. \n\nII. FOOD & DRINK: Like many other Mediterranean joints, Cafe Agora offers rice plates, sandwiches, salads, and desserts, and various vegetable appetizers. The food, honestly, does not set itself apart from others, but I do think they can satisfy a fix. What I've had:\n\n*Fried Eggplant: Like the name says, this appetizer comes with fried eggplant as well as green peppers, tomato sauce, and garlic. It's basically a Mediterranean stirfry with a lot of flavors. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but if you love eggplant then give it a try for yourself.\n\n*Lamb & Beef Gyro: Call me basic, but I love this beef and lamb beauty wrapped in a pita bread. Topped with lettuce, onions and tzatziki sauce, it perfectly combines savory, crunchy, and fresh. The sauce could use more garlic, dill, and black pepper to bring a harder kick, but it did a well-enough job tying everything together. Consider ordering this!\n\n*Hummus: Their hummus -- consisting of mashed chickpeas, fresh lemon juice, mined garlic, olive oil, and tahini and garnished with ezme and tabouli -- is A-OK. I thought it could have been smoother and more flavorful. After having a few other hummuses in the city, though, I wouldn't call it one of my favorites. \n\nIII. SERVICE: During each of my visits, I've been called, \"friend\" and received my food promptly. I've never had any problems.\n\nIV. AMBIENCE & DECOR: In contrast to the rest of the Peachtree Street NE, this hole-in-the-wall seems to have endured the renovations in the area. (That's a good thing.) The humble interior has two floors, and, by the looks of the seating, the restaurant caters to the lunch crowd.\n\nV. PRICES: It's hard to complain about prices when most things on the menu cost less than $15. And when considering Cafe Agora resides in Midtown, it's a great bargain.\n\nVI. OVERALL: I wouldn't consider Cafe Agora as one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants in Atlanta, but when it comes to affordability, speed, and quality this place is hard to beat.",
