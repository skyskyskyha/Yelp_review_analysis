I'm not usually a fan of fusion, but something about crispy wonton skins smothered in Japanese sriracha mayo and gochujang and a hefty serving of meat (personal preference--bulgogi beef) really really calls my name. The Taiwanese nuggets and Thai tots are also delicious. I've mostly ordered off the street foot/apps menu, so I can't comment too much on the mains. But, I feel like the vibe of this place is more along the lines of beer and a bite to share anyway.",

        "text": "There isn't really any restaurant or bar I can compare Pijiu Belly to. It's a unique Chinese, Korean, Japanese, American mix of menu items paired with American Craft Beer. Truly something for everyone.\n\nThe dishes that really standout here are:\nSuper Nachos w/bulgogi\nFried Pork Belly over rice\nTaiwanese Fried Chicken\nGeneral Tso's Chicken\nRamen\n\nThe Super Nachos aren't exactly nacho chips, they're fried wonton wrappers. That mixed with the all the fixings on a Nacho Supreme but with bulgogi instead of ground beef makes this amazing! It's really filling, I order this as a meal and take half of it home. No one makes this, it is a must try!\n\nFried Pork Belly over rice. This is awesome! It's got a few pieces of flash fried pork belly with bok choy and rice. Simple, delicious, and again \"no one else makes this!\"\n\nTaiwanese fried chicken is fantastic! It's salted basil fried chicken chunks.\nThis is super hard to find in Georgia. It's a staple of Taiwanese snacks and Pijiu Belly's version is as close to it as you'll find to the real thing.\n\nGeneral Tso's Chicken: Pijiu's version uses dark meat and it's a little spicy. Not like the wimpy reheated white meat chunks served at most take out places. \n\nRamen - I'm a fan of the Tonkatsu but there are others here to choose from as well. Their broth is delicious and I feel like Pijiu's generous with their noodles as well. Low key awesome ramen spot!\n\n******************************************************\nIf you're still reading after all this, items worth trying as well:\nFish and Chips\nDefinitely Spicy Pork Bulgogi over Beef Bulgogi\nand of course CHICKEN WINGS! This is Atlanta after all!",

        "text": "Let's start by saying that Wednesday night is trivia night so if you want a quiet dinner where you won't be interrupted then don't go on Wednesday's. \n\nThe atmosphere is hip and inviting. They have board games and a shuffle board table to play. So if you're waiting or done eating and want to show your friends or date your skills, then have at it. \n\nI went with a group of 6 friends. Everything went smoothly from ordering our drinks and food. The waiter did forget one of my friends order so he got his food last but the waiter never admitted that he forgot to put in the order. I ordered the favorite Pijiu Burger ($13) and it comes with a side so I order the fries. There were a lot of fries. I also ordered their old fashioned drink ($10) and it was perfect. \n\nThe ramen tasted amazing. However, the egg was a bit over cooked. I would definitely come back because all the portions were very generous.",

Basically sweet potato tatter tots with jalapeño & some mayo on top. \n\nI thought I would really like the Tempura Oden but it wasn't as good as I thought. It was mostly just the fried tempura portion of it, I could barely tell there was any fish in it.\n\nBulgogi Kimchi Taco was probably one of my top two. Every bit of the taco was good. I wish I ordered this prior but at least now I know for the next time I come back.\n\nI didn't get a photo of the wings but trust me they are also worth getting & of course my other favorite. I elected to go the spicy route but my brother switched it to the sweet sauce & it was a great choice.\n\nOverall good experience there, no happy hour though :(",

It was very good.  We went about 2pm on Sunday.  No wait, though it was busy (always a good sign).  The food did not disappoint.  My son ordered the Rotisserie Chicken and waffles (he gets this dish everywhere he can).  He loved it.  Even liked the BBQ sauce (he normally doesn't like it).  He wanted to have it shipped to our home.  My fiancé and I listened to the waiter and ordered the Yangnyeom Chicken and Crispy Braised Pork Belly sandwich.  My fiancé also had the Kentucky Joe- coffee and bourbon.  The chicken was one of the best dishes I've had in my life.  I would eat it every day!  This place is a must...so many dishes I wanted to try but can only eat so much at a time!  I'd go back today if I wasn't in New Jersey!",

        "text": "Friends have said this place was super good, and so it seemed like a worthy place to try out with friends. I found it to be just okay: right around 3 1/2 stars.\n\nI originally wanted the jellyfish salad and bulgogi kimchi tacos but changed my order since the jellyfish salad was out. I guess it's popular. Instead, I ordered the Piju Belly burger (rec by a member of our group). \n\nI found the burger to be sort of plain with only the slightest of slight kimchi pieces and sriracha mayo. The burger was thick and juicy, but at the end of the day, it was just a burger in my mind. The fried egg was an interesting twist to the burger though. Apparently the burger came with a free side so I choose the cold Yakisoba noodles, which was good.\n\nThe complimentary appetizers brought out by the owner bc we had a friend who knew him made me super full:\n\nPoutine: I don't know what to say about this as the teriyaki sauce (interesting Asian twist) made the fries super soggy and messy. I'd have to say no to this dish and don't rec you ordering it.\n\nPijiu's super nachos: The nachos were good, but the fried wonton skins were way too crispy. It was good, but was it really worth $14?! I'd say it's a great sharing plate (or even as the main entree for lite eaters). Overall, it was yummy.\n\nSome other items I sampled from friends worthy of a mention:\n\nSweet corn cheese: I'd say this is your typical sweet corn smothered in cheese. If you like this elsewhere, you'll like it here.\n\nTaiwanese nuggets: The nuggets were pretty tender and juicy. I'd have to say it's pretty delish. There were various dipping sauces that were available that I didn't get to try. Friends seemed to oo and ah as they sampled it.\n\nPork belly bowl: The roasted pork belly was huge! It was super tender and flavorful as I sampled a small piece from my friend. Aside from the humongous pork belly, the remainder of the dish was rather plain with the bok choy and rice. \n\nOther tid bits I observed... There was also a free foosball table and something else as entertainment -- sorry that I can't recall. I believe there were darts as well. If nothing else, chill at the bar and have a drink if you're not ready to grab food.",

I didn't know what to expect because on the outside the restaurant looks like a tiny house turned restaurant but on the inside it's this spacious bar with seating for days.  The decor is really unique to the space and it was super clean.   \n\nThe highlight of the space is the food.  They have mastered the affordable lunch that packs a tasty punch.  I ordered the Salmon Lunch Box and was shocked that it was around $10.  Most Salmon dishes run around $15.  But this box had a side of rice, salad, potstickers, and Miso Soup.  All portions were the perfect size and was enough to get me full and happy.  The Salmon was cooked to medium perfection.  It wasn't too tough and it wasn't raw just the way it should be.  \n\nI would totally recommend you come here with your co-workers, friends, and even on a date.  The price point and food is just right for your appetite!",

        "text": "Pijiu Belly's convenient location in West Midtown and interesting menu of Korean fusion fare made it one of the first restaurants my fiance and I bookmarked to visit when we first moved to Atlanta. However, for one reason or another, we never got around to trying it until very recently. We wish we had not waited so long, as both the food and service here were pretty great. \n\nPijiu Belly has typical bar ambiance and boasts a sizeable outdoor patio during warm weather. Though we did not imbibe, beer acts as the main beverage draw here and the draft list carries something for everyone. Our server remained available throughout our meal and made very helpful suggestions in guiding us through the menu. Per his suggestion, we opted for three small plates and split an entree.\n\nOur three small plates captivated our tastes buds the most. The Thai tots offered a smart take on sweet potato tots by pairing them with piquant accompaniments such as spicy mayo, garlic, and jalapeno. The kimchi pork stir fry was pure Korean goodness and brought well stir fried slices of pork and veggies sizzling in a spicy gochujang sauce. Sambal wings, a special that evening, brought seven crisp, meaty bones of intense garlic-chili flavor.\n\nOur entree, Pijiu's specialty chicken, came next. The half chicken comes with two sides which, for us, comprised a simple potato-cabbage-corn hash and kimchi. We found the sides so-so (the hash a bit bland, and the kimchi less funky than I'm used to), but the chicken itself satisfied. The bird is first cooked rotisserie style then flash fried to crisp the skin. The crackly, well flavored skin is the highlight here and lacks the greasiness of most fried chicken. The breast meat ran a little dry but the darker meats remained juicy. \n\nWe left totally stuffed and paid about $45 with tip, which was totally reasonable given the quantity/quality of food and great service. We will certainly be back for more craveable Asian inspired bar food.",

        "text": "I was pretty excited to visit this place after seeing it on Triple D. The signature dish tends to be the chicken but my wife and I were in the mood for something a bit more different. \n\nWe loved our appetizer the cheese curd, teriyaki fries were really good but the actual fries to us were just kinda average. I felt like they need to be more supportive of the cheese and gravy.  \n\nShe ordered the Spicy Dumpling Ramen. She really loved it, minus the wasabi dumpling that snuck up on her she loved the flavor of her ramen broth and was so happy! Perhaps better explanation of the dumpling when ordering would be better or make sure to read about the dumplings on the other page of the menu. \n\nI ordered the Crispy Pork Belly Sandwich with Peach Hoisin Sauce and the Beef Pho. Wow, the peach sauce was awesome the pork belly was yummy, I felt like it could have been a little warmer, perhaps it sat for a few minutes while other things were being made. The Beef Pho was amazing. I didn't realize that i was supposed to put the extra veggies and sauce in the Pho till the end even after the waiter had told me. I'm slow sometimes. \n\nGreat place I can't wait to get back and try other things!!",

The party that we came was pretty big, so let's just get straight to the food. I ordered the Three Meat Scramble and I got to try out the Pork Belly Egg Benedict, because well everyone ordered it (including the GF).\n\nSo I'll keep this short and simple. The Three Meat Scramble? Meh. The dish was drizzled with this mustard sauce that was just completely overpowering. If they laid down on the sauce it would be better. The pork belly egg benedict was basically a farm house type dish. Instead of being served on english muffins, it was served on full hamburger buns. It was massive for a breakfast meal. Definitely worth it.\n\nI think one thing I took away from here was if I were to come back, I would definitely eye the Chicken and Waffles because I saw other tables order it and it looked pretty tasty. So, I think if I were to give you a tip this would be it... If you're at brunch, give that chicken and waffles a look.\n\nI enjoyed Pijiu Belly. Definitely should be a spot to check out if you're looking for brunch.",

The food is definitely top-notch, well-made, and filling.  We had a selection of appetizers and I opted for the cheesesteak which was very good.  \n\nBiggest gripe has to be the forced valet parking, it's completely unnecessary, especially on a weeknight.

The bento box with the beef option was what I selected from the lunch menu.  The beef was delightful! It has just the right amount of seasoning and perfectly paired over a bed of shredded lettuce.  The rice was cooked to perfection.  The miso soup was \"uniquely\" flavored (not to my liking), but it did not take away from the other options in the bento box.  The salad with ginger? dressing was on par with typical appetizer salads, but the fried pork dumplings and dipping sauce were stellar.  All the food arrived hot and fresh.  The decor at Pijiu Belly was as inviting as the food and the people.  Job well done!",

There is a dining area in the back of the restaurant and a more bar-like hangout area in the front. There's a foosball table and cornhole in the patio area. Seems like it would be a good place to hangout when the weather's nice.\n\nI ordered the Bulgogi bop which is basically is a bowl of brown rice topped with bulgogi chopped kimchi, cabbage, etc. They gave a generous portion of meat! I couldn't finish all my food and brought half of the home for another meal. The owners here are super friendly! They came over to chat after hearing my friend and I talk in Mandarin and were very warm and welcoming.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try other things on their menu!",

        "text": "One of the few Asian themed gastropub you can find inside the Atlanta perimeter that's actually worth going to for decent food.  Normally the Asian eats are up north where the foods are pleasant in pleasanthill.  Pijiu actually means \"beer\" in mandarin, our server gave us this little bit of trivia info. Their burgers topped with the kimchi gives just enough heat to give it a unique flavor worth trying. This is the second time I tried their ramen noodle. First time was watered down, but the second time I could tell they put a little more love at flavoring their broth. Meat was plentiful as well as noodle content.  \n\nParking lot is small so it would be better to car pool,  but if you must all drive separately for your large party there is parking across the street. Not sure if they tow or not but I wouldn't risk it during work hours. \n\nIf you're looking for a place to chill with friends over a beer I'd recommend his place as well. Pregame and go watch Atlanta United play over at Georgia tech!",
