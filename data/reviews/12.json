We ordered the clam chowder, grilled octopus, the lobster roll, and raw oysters ( today they had bluepoints).  The oysters were good, I realize that Atlanta is landlocked so......although they were fresh, I know they still had a ways to travel to get to us.  The service was great! The only \"concern\" was the latest health inspection score.......that said,  I am not afraid to eat there again and will return but I had to say something because I saw the score.",

        "text": "Food, service and ambience were all present during a brunch at Seven Lamps on Sunday, February 18, 2024. What a wonderful, cozy little restaurant tucked in the Around Lenox shopping mall. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. You will see from the photos how lovely the table was and how color coordinated everything was with the flowers and drinks. We had mimosas, one with grapefruit and one with orange juice. The food was delicious and beautifully prepared and presented. I had fish tacos. They were really good. I could have eaten more, and the accompanying salad was perfect and so pretty, I didn't want to eat it, but I did! My lunch date had the oysters. She said they were excellent. The restaurant is small and the menu is somewhat limited, but they take reservations and you will enjoy the food. Parking is free at Around Lenox. Highly recommended. You will love it.",

We were definitely surprised to see that the restaurant was quite smaller than expected, but giving it a chance we came in with the open mind and we ended up grabbing a little snack as well.

Something unique is that the bar was not somewhere you could sit but had a long table right in front of it for you to still get the feel.\n\nRecommends:\n- Pushin \"P\"\n- Sean's secret sangria \n- Smoke Signal\n- BGE SMOKED & FRIED WINGS",

I really recommend you try this. \n\nThe only reason they are getting a 4 out of 5 stars is because the fish itself was very bland. It didn't have any flavor. The brussel sprouts this time were not crispy and done. They were very hard in the middle. We did order another order and asked them to cook them longer and they came out perfect. \n\nThis review doesn't count them out because I still like the vibe and would definitely go back.",

The portions are small so not really ideal for sharing and you might want to order a couple dishes to fill you up. The hush puppies were awful and recommended by our waitress. It tasted super greasy and nothing like I expected. The only thing that really stood out to me was their espresso dessert. I'm not sure if they have a different menu but looking on Yelp, that's what it appears to be unless it's not updated. Oh yeah, they no longer have the fried okra!",

        "text": "I wound down my Atlanta visit with a lunch at Seven Lamps, which my brother highly recommended from his previous experience.  The hip space was tucked away in the corner of a strip mall, making it a hidden gem for those in the know.  While they had a nice outdoor patio, we decided to bask in the air conditioning of the indoor space.  The dining room had an industrial vibe with an open kitchen where we could watch the staff assemble our meal.\n\nThe menu was full of healthy, creative dishes, so we decided to order a few things and share them, in order to try more items.  The Avocado & Quinoa Salad was mainly an arugula and quinoa base, which was topped with very few pumpkin seeds, cucumbers, and radishes, as well as the aforementioned avocado slices.  While the salad was rather plain, even with its salsa verde vinaigrette, the Grilled Shrimp that we added were amazing!  The plump shellfish had a hint of smokiness, which was really interesting.  We also ordered the Mahi Mahi Ceviche, which was served in a glass containing layers of orange slices, an avocado mousse, and a ginger tequila aguachile.  It was a very refreshing rendition of a ceviche, but it would have been appreciated if the acidic blend was served with some sort of bread or crackers. Lastly, the Crispy Brussels Sprouts had been seasoned with apple cider vinegar and curry.  The sprouts were a bit overcooked for my liking, but the curry seasoning, as well as the toppings of peanuts and mint crema, added an unique flavor profile to what has often become a popular, mainstream dish.\n\nSeven Lamps provided an innovative and enjoyable ending to our Atlanta adventure and would be worth seeking out in its concealed location.",

This particular evening was quite busy with several large parties and it was exciting. \n\nOctopus was cooked well and pickled potatoes were great. \nPasta was disappointing, but the mushrooms, tomatoes and corn were delicious. Noodles are vegan and I didn't realize this. Might not have ordered. \n\nGreat ambiance, neat atmosphere.",

The location is in a shopping center and parking was easy. Our server was with us quickly to get our drink orders. We took a long time to order both because we were chatting and because there are so many good options.\n\nWe started with the pimento cheese board and it was excellent. There was a great variety of items on the board, so even if you don't like pimento. you will enjoy this board. We also got the corn and jalapeno hush puppies. These were great as well, with it being fried just the right amount. For my entree, I got the burger. The sweet onions were a nice touch, but I felt the bun was a bit dry.

Good selections were presented for the wine pairing although we may have enjoyed ordering four of our own drinks. However, the experience is worth letting the restaurant pick for you. Delicious brownie dessert with a coffee martini to close it out. The chef was nice and personable and came and explained each course. Our server Cam was great and very nice!",

YUM 10/10). I had the frozen piña colada, which was a perfect frozen consistency and fruity, but I'd probably try another cocktail next time, 7/10). Plus: it has FREE PARKING! Right outside, there is a large shopping center parking lot that's very accessible. \n\nCan't wait to check out brunch and dinner here... planning to become a regular!",

Prices for both food and beverages were absolutely appropriate. \n\nService was stellar, and while some might think the food and drink a tad slow to come out, I think it was absolutely appropriate for what we ordered. Good things take time! \n\nLoved the ambience as well.

The atmosphere was nice it wasn't packed which I appreciated.\n\nI ordered the plantains and the burger with a side of the bacon jam\n\nMy friends ordered the Brussels sprouts, the chicken, and the pimento cheese plate.\n\nThe plantains were fried to perfection. \n\nThe burger was a medium and juicy which I liked, I want.a fan of the bun though which had black sesame seeds on it. \n\nThe pimento cheese player was a hit with my friends. The Brussels were nice had a crisp but I do wish they had more crisp to them. \n\nI also ordered a gimme cocktail and it was tasty, it had the potential to be a sneak up on you type cocktail.",

It was burnt, so I sent it back and got the salmon and grits instead. The salmon in the grits was a little less charred. It tasted better. The relish jam was made of jalapeños, red green yellow peppers and red onion; it was a yummy touch. I ordered a mock passion fruit Moscow mule to drink. They make their ginger beer in house and it's sooo strong /spicy. I really enjoyed it though. The service was 10/10 no complaints.",

        "text": "I read tons of reviews and noticed the high ranking of stars so I just knew this was the restaurant to visit. When I arrived, my party was seated outdoors on a beautiful day to accommodate our size. So far everything was going great. We ordered drinks and appetizers. Our waitress brought out a round of drinks and water, but before she left, she dumped the access liquid from her tray on to the ground in between our table and another parties table. I looked up in disbelief. Who would dump anything out on the ground near dining patrons? \n\nNext we requested straws to drink from our glasses and were brought out several straws in her barehand. When this happened I immediately asked that she bring us covered straws as we were not going to use straws and place them in our beverages after being directly in her hands. The third strike was I ordered a burger and it was paired with hand cut fries, but the fries were burnt and the burger wasn't seasoned or flavorful nor does the restaurant provide regular ketchup. The ketchup paired with this dish is a house ketchup which if I'm being 100% honest, is not tasty at all. Two of us ordered burgers and we both sent back the fries for the same issue.\n\nNow I rated my experience a two because even though several things happened that made me write this restaurant off, there were some positives. The waitress brought out new fries that were freshly made and were not burnt. The lamb, shrimp, and okra were delicious dishes and the kids loved the chicken tenders. There were just so many things I didn't enjoy that I probably won't be back, but if you go get those three things I mentioned, you won't be disappointed, but can't promise the service will be any better.",

If you enjoy dipping sauces they came with 3 that the group enjoyed. We actually ordered another round \n\nOctopus: 2* it was too chewy on one end and the other was a bit over cooked \n\nMeals \nSpecial order lamb with succotash. 3* The Lamb was over cooked at medium but so glad I got the succotash as it was a highlight of the dish. My colleague had the lamb as it was supposed to be prepared and she wad def underwhelmed; hers was also over cooked. \n\nSmoked pork chop: 4* was excellent but no one liked the sides with it. We had it with \nOver all the food was inconsistent in the cook and flavors. \nBoth of our vegetarian dishes which has the be special orders did not come out as requested. \n\n\nAtmosphere 4\n-nice place for a dateif they could figure out food and service. \n\n\nService Mixed \n- drink service was very slow even \n- almost every dish that had a change was inaccurate.

We've enjoyed what we thought would be basic dishes burgers and fries, which turned out to be are anything but ordinary, The smoky wings are also delicious. In a nutshell, we haven't had anything that wasn't delicious, thanks to Chef Wes (who also stopped by our table our table last time to check on us). \n\nI can't say enough about the cocktails! The last time we went, Jenna made us both a drink called Gimme Passion, and it is by far the best drink I've ever had. Jenna was also our server and was so accommodating and friendly, which you'll also find amongst all the staff. \n\nThe ambience, whether it is afternoon or evening, is amazing. It's great for dates,  brunch with your girlfriends or hanging  with your friends for a very chill time. \n\nI highly recommend this place!",

Located in the shops around Lenox, seven lamps is nestled in a corner so it's a little hard to find, but look for west elm and flower child.\n\nWe had a party of 4 and were seated instantly. Our waitress was awesome and was super attentive and had our drinks and food out super fast. I had the pork tenderloin with bean ragu and vegetables on top. All of the food tasted amazing, the only critique I have is the pork was a little undercooked.\n\nOverall, seven lamps was great and I'd definitely like to come back in the future!",

        "text": "Seven Lamps is a cozy, little restaurant located in the shopping center across from Lenox Square Mall. The signage is not very noticeable from the street but it's right next to Kendra Scott. I stopped in for a solo weekday lunch and was pleasantly greeted by the host. The restaurant was semi-busy and I opted to sit at the high-top table. The tables are long and are designed as shared European-style seating. Luckily, I came at the perfect time to have the whole high-top to myself. I can imagine it may be awkward to dine here for a date night or intimate dinner on a crowded night. \n\nThey offer an extensive, customized menu with some unique offerings. I opted for the spicy Maine mussels with andouille sausage. It came with about 25 mussels and a tasty tomatillo sauce and onions. I was a bit disappointed with the andouille sausage since it was a very small amount but overall, the mussels had a rich flavor and a nice spicy kick to it. The service was excellent and prices are fair.",

I recommend trying a small plate such as the hush puppies and pumpkin hummus and save room for the bread pudding for dessert but The real reason I'm reviewing this restaurant is for the impeccable service we received from Danesha.  \n\nThere's a difference between someone who waits tables and a professional server. Danesha is a professional server.  She radiated goodness as she approached our table and took the time to provide recommendations on the menu.  She came back to check on us but wasn't over bearing.  With each approach back to our table, she brought good energy with her.  I don't have enough good things to say about her.  She's that good!\n\nIf you eat at this restaurant, ask for Danesha.

        "text": "Seven Lamps seems like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, you can easily miss it where it is located, but WHAT A GEM! We met for dinner with friends on a Saturday night and had a really positive experience. We really wanted to sit outside and enjoy our last few nights of summer in September. The outdoor seating was covered by individual umbrellas and the weather was perfect. I appreciated their short but flavorful-sounding menu. They have some nice mixed cocktails on the menu as well. \n\nFor the table we ordered - (2) orders of the Georgia Royal Red Shrimp (omg the brioche was amazing, never thought of eating it like that), an order or Brussell sprouts, and individually I ordered the smoked duck, my husband ordered the chicken, and our friends got the pork tenderloin, and salmon. Everyone really enjoyed their food and raved about how excellent the meal was. But my meal - the smoked duck with curry, sweet potato, and plantains is where it's at. Duck is generally pretty oily to me, but I loved my serving at Seven Lamps. \n\nI love that the menu seems to always change and they don't have the same thing all the time. The service was good and they played good music the whole night. All in all, we had a great time and will definitely be back.",

        "text": "We stopped in for lunch a little before 3pm on Saturday. We were seated pretty quickly after the hostess wiped down the table. Can't say the same for the chairs which seemed to have some type of glitter on them.  And this was probably the highlight of the service for the afternoon.  We were seated for about 15 minutes before someone came to our table to take our drink order only to find out it was the waitress that was next to us chatting up the couple at that table.  By that time we had already looked at the menu and knew what we wanted so we ordered everything at once. We ordered fried plantains for an appetizer ($10); the burger and fries ($18); and Springer Mountain farms chicken breast w/ fingerling potatoes ($24). And then more waiting. We watched while our waitress floated around like a social butterfly mostly talking to her coworkers and seemingly flirting with one of the cooks. That was when we could see her in the main dining area. Apparently she was also at the bar at some point helping to make drinks per one of the other servers we finally asked after waiting more than 15 minutes to get the check.  When she eventually came to the table we asked her for the check directly and she still didn't immediately go over to the register to print it.  More social time.  We got it about 10 minutes later and it included two items we didn't ordered that were added and then credited back at the bottom of the ticket. This bad service really overshadowed the food. The plantains were a bit greasy. The chicken's presentation looked good but the flavors were not very good or complimentary of the chicken. \nPer my husband the burger was a standout and was seasoned to perfection, although it was well done and not cooked medium as he requested. Not worth a return visit.",
