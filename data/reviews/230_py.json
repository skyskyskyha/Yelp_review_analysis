The steakhouse burger was not bad, but the fries weren't that fresh and hot.",

                "text": "We chose Davio's for our monthly date night due to its service, food and romantic atmosphere.  \n\nFrom the moment you arrive until the moment you leave you are treated like a valued customer.  You can never go wrong with Davio's, they are true professionals and skilled chefs.  I love being able to try their new dishes and this was my first time having the sea bass, but it definitely won't be the last.  I usually go with 2-3 of the same entrees on each of my visits, but was properly swayed by our server Justice to try the sea bass.  I am sometimes skeptical of ordering sea bass unless I am strictly at a seafood restaurant.  Davio's executed the sea bass perfectly and it will now be my go to place when I am craving sea bass.  It was pan seared and lightly seasoned but cooked just enough to give it the perfect texture which can sometimes be challenging for a seasoned seafood chef.  \n\nWe also ordered the spring roll sampler for the appetizer.  My favorite is the Buffalo chicken spring roll while my dining companions favorite is the Philly steak spring roll.  Another highlight of our meal was the broccolini best in the USA from my experience.  I wish I could duplicate that at home.  It has a slightly spicy seasoning but it's not overly hot.  We also opted for the short ribs with a Demi reduction, I substituted my gnocchi for a side of lobster risotto another one my favorites.  \n\nLet's just say if you are in the city or out of the city, a trip to Davios is always worth it.  Ask for Justice, she won't steer you wrong and you will be served by one of the best.  Free parking in the parking garage or valet in front for those special occasions.  \n\nThis restaurant is classy enough to be dressed in formal attire but you can arrive in casual clothing and still be treated like royalty.  I am already looking forward to my next visit",

                "text": "Came here for a birthday dinner in one of their private rooms. The deposit was 1k. That was paid via card. Prior to signing the contract I inquired if I would need able to use cash and another card when I actually show up to dinner. Upon arriving things went well until it didn't. 1. Many of my guests had cold food. When they reported the food was cold, they \"remade\" the dishes. To our surprise, the dishes weren't actually remade but they reheated the plates and switched around the plates as if it was remade. 2. I was given a complimentary shot that ended up being added to my tab. 3. Despite asking about payment options beforehand, I was told at the establishment that I could not use cash and could only use the card on file. I presented 80% of the tab in cash. The manager made no accommodations and insisted that the only form of payment that could be used was the card on file. As you can imagine, that was not feasible for a party of 16 guests and mostly having cash. 4. Prior to being presented with the receipt, my card was charged without a final signature. \n\nOverall, my experience for my birthday dinner was absolutely ruined. While the food that WAS hot was good, nothing else about my experience was up to par. I would highly NOT recommend this establishment for any big events due to their inability to be consistent with payment expectations. The alleged manager was very condescending, asking if I knew what a contract was and printing out a contract that didn't specify final forms of payment.Spending almost $3,000 to them means nothing apparently.\n\nFollowing my event I followed up with the events manager that I had been communicating with, as well as the regional manager. Both were very apologetic and insisted that I should have been able to utilize cash and another card. They also offered a complimentary meal for myself and one other guest. While I TRULY appreciate their response, it does not negate the fact that I was 1. Treated disrespectfully at my own birthday dinner 2. Left the restaurant with my card overdrafted because the \"manager\" decided to run my payment without my consent\". \n\nI truly dislike to pull the race card, especially when my own people are also involved. But this response felt racial motivated, even though the manager was also the same race as me. All I can assume is that HE assumed a room full of young Black people would not be able to afford the caliber of dinner that we were receiving and decided to charge my card beforehand to reduce risk of no payment. But he was wrong and when cash was presented, he would have needed to own up to his fraudulent activity. While the food was good, I cannot say I will return. I've been to several restaurants and have never received the level of disrespect that I did during a night that was supposed to be so special to me.",

The esthetic's were pleasing to the eye, very classy setup. We were seated quickly and our server, Sidney was AMAZING throughout the full experience! She explained some things in the menu and offered her advice on some of the great dishes that she had tried. We started with drinks that were amazing and they have this light, flaky cheese bread that's more like popovers...they were really good! I ordered a salad which was sooo fresh and had fresh blue cheese crumbles and candied pecans! Everything was really amazing. If you get a chance to visit please do and ask for Sidney!",

The restaurant is located in the mall, but there is direct parking and access right in front of the mall. Valet is also available. It's a good spot for business lunch and dinner meetings, but less of a social vibe for a weekend. \n\nWe enjoyed the hearty salad with salmon, Caesar salad, steak frites, and popovers. Popovers were the crowd fave. Salad and salmon was $30 and martinis were ~$15 each.",

                "text": "I was in the mall with a friend and we decided to stop by Davio's during happy hour. I've seen Davio's many times, while in the mall, but never stopped to try it. This was my first time at Davio's and it won't be my last. The timing was perfect when we went because it was very quiet and we sat at the bar. Darriana was our bartender and she was amazing. Super helpful and patient. My friend and I were originally only stopping by to get a cocktail. Well one cocktail led to three, along with dinner and desserts. I started off with the perfect pineapple margarita and my friend ordered a cucumber gimlet. Both of our cocktails were made to perfection. We then decided we were a tad bit hungry, so we ordered a side of Parmigiano Fries and another round of cocktails. The fries were sooo good. They were hot, fresh cut, and crispy. We also enjoyed the sauces, which accompanied the fries. As we continued catching up, I decided I was going to go ahead and order dinner. I ordered the braised beef short rib sliders. The meat was tender and the buns were soft. While still enjoying our food, cocktails, and convo, the manager for the night, Luis, stopped by to introduce himself and ask about our experience. He was super friendly and professional. The overall service from everyone was superb. Since it was my friend's birthday was the next day, we ended the night with one more round of cocktails, which was a Stoli and an espresso martini. Both were really good. As a nightcap, I ordered two desserts to-go (carrot cake and butter cake) for my husband and I! The desserts were A+++! Since dining at Davio's a few weeks ago, I've been thinking about my next visit! If you're in the area or at the mall, make sure you check them out!",

We got the lobster risotto, mushroom gnocchi and the penne with chicken! We also got the tableside caesar salad. It was great! Our favorite was the penne.

I was surprised that there were not more people here, but it was a Tuesday evening around 7:30 when we arrived. We had great service tonight. I struggled with what to order as several things sounded so good. We started with an app of calamari which was delicious. Then they brought out the amazing pop over rolls, which are delicious. Then I went with the short ribs on a bed of blue cheese mashed potatoes. It was great too. My dinner companions had pasta with enormous shrimp which they seemed to really enjoy. Then a desert of some sort of ice cream or something was inside a bowl that had a chocolate lid on that they poured what tasted like an espresso over to melt and pour inside. \nI wish we would have come sooner, it was really good and I highly recommend it.",

                "text": "Davio's is a great example of how a bad business model can tank a restaurant.  My husband was in Atlanta on business and I came along, so I was committed to at least two group meals at restaurants I hadn't chosen. Thursday night we went to. French bistro that was packed and noisy, so we asked to sit outdoors and waited while they set up a table in a quiet part of the patio.  once we were seated, staff was gracious and focused on making sure we were comfortable. Because they were so pleasant, we were encouraged to upgrade our orders to the prIx fixe menu and order a second round of drinks.  Dinner cost about $100 apiece and we were happy to spend it.\n\nFriday, we went to Davio's.  They made it clear from the start that dinner was about them, not us.  The server said he would explain the menu  after he took drink orders.  I said that I didn't know what I wanted to drink until I decided what I wanted to eat: could he please explain the menu first? No, he had to take drink orders first. So I tried to puzzle out why some entrees came with side dishes and others didn't, and whether I could get the salmon with something other than lump crab, which I can't eat.  When the waiter did \"explain the menu,\" he simply read it word for word, adding \"that's one of my favorites\" to about half the selections.  I had to ask him whether the $35 a la carte salmon included any side dishes.  It did not; I would have to pay an additional $15-19 for each vegetable. I then decided it would be useless to ask them to alter the $39 non a la carte salmon entree to my taste; I would just cut my losses and order the cheapest thing on the menu.  So I got a plate of spaghetti with plain tomato sauce. No salad, no drink, since the waiter never cycled back to ask what I wanted. Apparently, if you don't order drinks on the first round, you get plain water. (Which was actually not a bad thing,  since two of the other diners in our party got the wrong drinks and drank them anyway.)\n\nMaybe selling folks a bowl of pasta for $24 instead of a three course meal for $50, plus what they spend on drinks, is a better per meal profit margin, but since Davio's was three quarters empty on a Friday night, unlike our jam-packed Thursday bistro, I can't think that their approach is more profitable in the long run.  But I'll never know,  because I'll never be back.",

                "text": "The great news is that Davios is back!  This is a great lunch spot for those of us in the Phipps area.  They do a great job in the kitchen, and it's got a nice space.  For me, this is great food that is as healthy as you want it to be.  I've been back several times since the reopening and have had good experiences.  Unfortunately, Paul Dunn, the former manager has left (Le Colonial, where he's doing a great job), and I don't know the new management, but operations seem to be working well.\n\nI did have an absolutely bizarre experience today with our male waitstaff, Kareem.  I had a business lunch, so we were not in a rush, but after being left alone with empty water glasses for about 20 minutes, Kareem came and took our order.  We asked for more chips/bread, refilled water and tea.  After  a little more than ten minutes, nothing had come, so I walked over to where Jamal was standing at the end of the bar.  I reminded him politely that we had requested more chips and a refill on our drinks.  He said he was about to do that, and I looked at my watch and remarked that it had been about ten minutes.  He became infuriated and took two steps to get in my face and said, \"Don't you cop an attitude with me.\"  I thought he was going to throw a punch right then and there.  This was from a smiling guy to a fighter in about 0.5 seconds flat!\n\nQuickly another waitperson and a floor manager identified what was going on.  I told them I wanted a different person to help us, and a lady offered and quickly got us what we needed.  Unfortunately the store manager, who was at the line observed that there was a problem, but he opted not to investigate the matter.  When he brought our food over, I made him aware of what happened.  He apologized, but Kareem continued to serve other tables.  This is official notice in a public forum to management that you have someone who nearly assaulted a customer, and you let him keep at work for the day.  If any customer is assaulted by Kareem, they should read this review and see that there is a history of intimidating behavior that management was made aware about.\n\nSadly, despite this being very near my office and enjoying the restaurant (usually), I do not want to dine where I feel that management will turn a blind eye to an employee attempting to intimidate a customer.  I score Davios four stars because it's usually a very good experience for a business meal, but I will walk over to the many other restaurants near my office, where I'm not concerned I may be assaulted.\n\nBut if you want some excitement, go ask for Kareem!\n\nManagement, if you're reading this, you need to invest in some anger management training for this employee.  He is a risk to your other employees (if he snaps at a customer, who was politely asking for something) then he's probably snapped at some co-workers.  He's likely a risk to your other customers, and he may even be a risk to you.",

I've wanted to try this restaurant for quite some time. This restaurant is inside Phipps plaza. I believe you can get in from the inside and outside.  Not 100% sure. I parked in the parking deck and didn't know where to go from there. I called and I think her name was Kaitlyn, very sweet and endearing young lady. She tried to steer me in the right direction. As you can see, I made it. Lol. Our waiter was Lance!  Lance, where have you been all my life? Lance schooled us on the menu and gave recommendations. I will tell y'all what I had later. The food came out and Lance and his crew swarmed the table like synchronized swimmers. Basically, several waiters came to being the food so that no one would be sitting without food while others ate. What kind of genius idea is this?  Bravo Davios... bra-freaking-vo!  I had the penne with applewood smoked chicken. Say what now?!?  Delicious!  Y'all I just got finished eating the leftovers. I'm still excited. Anyway.... Y'all go, eat, be merry. Grab some friends and ask for Lance. Tell him I sent you. He's not going to know who the heck I am but hey... still ask for him.",

But this... the food and service was amazing. We started off with the chicken Parmesan spring roll - so good! I had the shrimp fettuccine which was creamy, and the pasta was perfect. The Brussels sprouts were roasted with subtle flavor that was great. We had a huge party and our waiter did an excellent job accommodating our needs and orders. Thankfully there are many other options besides steak. Definitely coming back!",

We topped it off with a chocolate ice cream dessert. I thought the meal was excellent and it wasn't crowded (we came at the beginning of lunch).

Salad needs something more than argyle and Parmesan cheese in her opinion\n\nMake sure u say u want real sugar w coffee\n\nAnd they don't split bills - we were doing all the math.....\n\nStill love davios but can u split a bill without making customers do math?",

They had Sam Adams summer ale which I really like.  They had mostly national brands.  Supplementing with a few local would be good\n\nBread 4.5.  They have these puffy chewy breads (had same thing in their New York store as well.  Unique and very good\n\nMain course.  5. They had a swordfish special that was amazing.  A tomato based topping.  So good.  Brussels sprouts under cooked.  Risotto good too, with sun dried tomatoes\n\nDessert.  5.  Cannolis on cut fruit with a citrus sauce under.  So so so good\n\nService. 3.5. It was fine. The restaurant wasn't busy and wasn't as attentive as could be. Or friendly.  But didn't take away from the meal.",

Aside from the wonderful company (my friend who I haven't seen since we traveled to Sicily together earlier this year!), we were served by Mark. Mark is a trip! Engaging, humorous, professional and welcoming. He took great care of us and while the Davio's meal was excellent, his service made it a five star experience.\n\nWe shared the chicken parm egg rolls to start. They have a variety of different egg rolls (buffalo chicken, spinach and feta, Philly cheese steak) including a sampler if you can't decide. It's a cute fusion and I can't say that I've seen anything like this elsewhere. Three of them, cut in half and served with marinara sauce and parmesan cheese. A tasty appetizer and a clever concept.\n\nFor mains, I chose the cavatelli. Yeah, I broke my keto diet for this dish of pasta but it was worth it. Served with their house-made pork sausage (oh, my!), peas, truffle butter and shaved parmesan, it was a treat. And the best part was that they did a lunch-sized portion for me at half-price. (Not sure if they do that for everyone or just because Mark is so awesome.) Because the full sized portion that my friend had of the bolognaise was a lot of food and she took two-thirds of hers home. I'm away from home, so I didn't over order and have leftovers.\n\nFree parking upstairs and downstairs because Davio's is located inside the mall. There's also valet parking if that's something that interests you.\n\n[Review 13451 overall, 770 of 2020.]",

Came on a Monday night so it wasn't crowded and did not have reservations but was immediately seated. Service was very good and they have an extensive menu and beverage selection. The bread is delicious. Definitely the type of bread to soak up deliciousness from pasta. Our selections included crab Cake appetizer, meatballs, and beef short rib pasta. Everything was delicious. The crab cake and short ribs were the best. For dessert, they actually bring a dessert cart and show you everything in person. Probably not in the best location but definitely worth a visit now that they have reopened.",

I ordered a peach martini that was very good.\n\nWe decided to try the spring roll sampler based on other reviews that I saw. The rolls arrived in halves so we could both try all four. Philly cheese roll was pretty tasty. Buffalo chicken was flavorful and not spicy. The chicken pesto was okay. The spinach feta is okay. Not a huge feat fan.\n\nFor entrees, my friend ordered the spicy shrimp pasta, which Mary suggested. She said the pasta was made fresh daily. Also ordered NY strip steak. I tried the flat iron steak with truffle fries another Mary suggestion. The food came out in a timely fashion. The pasta tasted very fresh and definitely spicy. Not too spicy but you can definitely taste it. The shrimp were a large size. The portion size was perfect. The flat iron steak was good. I asked for medium and came out a little more rare. The truffle fries were good.\nNo sweets. We were full from dinner. The service was great along with the suggestions made for dinner. I would try a pasta dish next tine.",

After entering we found a place at the bar and met Shadrack, one of the coolest bar tenders I've met in a long time.  I explained to him that this was our first visit and asked if he could recommend anything because everything on the menu sounded so delicious. Mind you now, I was hungry so my concentration was off. Shadrack recommenced the pork chop later to find out there was a Christmas party and the pork chops were all out. So I went with the rib eye (my moms favorite cut of meat) which I can never go wrong with that! My date had scallops because she had the scallop appetizer (yes I said the scallop appetizer.) You only get one on the appetizer but it was so good she ordered the meal.  I also had the beef for an appetizer and it was seasoned very well. We added the goat cheese balls and a side of asparagus.   \n\nLet me say this, the food was absolutely phenomenal. The meat was seasoned to perfection and the scallops were cooked perfectly.  \n\nThe service is outstanding, the two ladies (sorry I forgot to get their names) at the front greeting everybody was extremely pleasant. \n\nShadrack makes a hell of a drink and is very cordial making our dining experience one we will never forget. I will certainly be going back to get the pork chop. You all should certainly check them out and when you do, stop by and see Shadrack and tell'em Drew sent ya! Y'all be easy!\nDrew",
