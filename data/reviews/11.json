I wasn't sure if I'd like it because I don't care for sparkling water and I assumed the pineapple would make the drink too sweet but it was a perfect balance of bitterness and slight sweetness. Also, either I was a light-weight that day or the drink is strong lol. For my appetizer, I ordered the smoked fish dip. For something that looks so simple, it had great flavor. I wanted to keep eating it and I finally had a caperberry.",

        "text": "I've been going through an oyster phase lately, and the Optimist is slowly helping me through it lol. \n\nLocation and Parking \nLocated in West Midtown, parking is going to cost you. I usually get a spot on the street behind the restaurant because I go to happy hour on weekdays. It's about $5 for 2 hours. \n\nVenue and Atmosphere \nWalking past a generously sized patio with large fans and plenty of seating, I noticed a mini golf course. I thought it was just decoration but apparently you can play mini golf in the summertime while you wait for your food. I'll have to return when it's warm outside, as golf and oysters is surely a great experience. Moving on to the interior, the oyster bar is on your left and main dining on the right. If you are there for happy hour, you will sit at the oyster bar (high tops, bar seating, and low top tables), and the seating is first come first served. The decor is smooth and nautical inspired, with just the right amount of lighting to set the mood for a romantic dinner or a fun night with friends. The restrooms are all individual stalls, outfitted with scented candles and high end soap ( I looked it up, it ain't cheap!). They truly spared no details in creating a fine dining experience. \n\nService \nService was prompt, courteous, and efficient. They practice team service, which meant our drinks were never empty and we received lots of smiling faces. \n\nFood and Beverages \nThe oysters were amazing. There are multiple varieties with tasting notes of each written on the menu (I prefer a bit of brine). They also have a \"bakers dozen\" if you can't decide. Oysters are served with house made mignonette, ht sauce, house made cocktail sauce, shaved horseradish, and a lemon wedge. I also ordered some dinner rolls... I could write a book about them but I'll just say this: these are the BEST dinner rolls I've ever eaten in my life. They are perfectly buttered, salted, and will literally melt in your mouth. \n\nVerdict \nI'm already a huge fan of happy hour, but I will be back to try the rest of the menu!",

        "text": "Disappointing Experience with Lobster Roll - Order with Caution\n\nLast night, I decided to try the much-hyped lobster roll from Optimist and opted for a to-go/pick up order. My anticipation was met with profound disappointment due to the quality of the meal received. Here are my thoughts:\n\nQuality: Unfortunately, the lobster roll did not live up to expectations. The lobster meat, which should be the star of the show, tasted soggy, significantly diminishing the overall flavor and experience. For a dish that often comes with a premium price tag, I expected fresh, succulent lobster. Instead, it seemed like the lobster salad had been sitting out for a while before it made its way into the roll.\nThe roll was stale! Like crouton level stale and I could barely bite half of the roll. \n\nPresentation and Packaging: While I understand that to-go orders can sometimes affect the presentation, it was clear that little effort had been made to ensure the meal would hold up during transport. The roll was half\nstale half soggy upon arrival, and the filling had spilled into the bag, creating a messy experience before I could even take my first bite.\n\nService: On a positive note, the ordering process was straightforward, and the staff was friendly. However, service alone can't compensate for the lack of quality in the food.\n\nOverall: I had high hopes for the lobster roll, especially given its reputation. Sadly, my experience was underwhelming due to the stale taste of the lobster. For anyone considering ordering the lobster roll to go, I would recommend caution. It might be worth trying dishes that travel better or dining in for the freshest",

        "text": "They have valet right next to the restaurant when you pull in the shared parking deck between The Optimist and Superica West Midtown, on Howell Mill road. You can text the valet to have your car ready by walking out. Paying  and tipping can also be done on phone.\n\nWe had a reservation for my friends birthday. They have a menu with a Happy Birthday stamp on it for her, and she likes it a lot. The food and service is as good as always. We started dinner at 7. The light of the restaurant still well lit by then but they will dim it down as the time goes later into the night. We're good with the light, but I think it will cause visual issue for some people when reading menu. The ambience is good. A bit loud since the place is packed on a Friday night. We had to speak up a bit to hear each other. \n\nWe had:\n+ Appetizer:\n- Roasted oysters: it's really good and not in the menu but you can always order it.\n- A dozen of raw oysters: Round Island and Bay Shores.\n- Blue crab claws: they're tiny but tasty. \n- Spicy kale salad.\n- Pei mussels.\n- Whole Shrimp a la Plancha with big toasts.\n\n+ Entree:\n- Roasted main lobster.\n- Whole flounder.\n\n+ Dessert: Sorbet of the moment, daiquiri.\n\nThe portion is a bit small for every dish. But we had lots of appetizers so we left with full happy tummies. All in all, if you're into seafood and oysters, this place has solid quality. Highly recommended!",

        "text": "Second visit last weekend...this review for oyster HH.     RULE #1 :  The basics:  I enjoy sitting at the main bar instead of the oyster bar.   It is quieter and service is far better.   Oyster prices are great - not all oysters are on special so, be careful when making your selection.    RULE #2 :  what to drink.   I prefer to order a bottle of bubbles.  Splurge a bit especially since the oysters are on special.   RULE #3 :  stick to the oysters....some items are generally not a good bargain.  Example:  lobster roll (see photo for details.)   A tiny bun with no lobster within - all (basically a tiny, tiny portion) lobster piled on top of the somewhat stale bun for $42",

        "text": "I went to the Optimist for a friend's birthday dinner after we had heard such great things! Definitely make a reservation before you go, but the staff was super accomodating and allowed us to add people to the reservation the day before. The parking lot is fairly small, however, they had self-park options in their deck as well as valet which is fairly easy and you can pay electronically! \n\nOnce inside, we were seated in the main dining area which is GORGEOUS. It might be one of the most stunning bars in Atlanta that I've seen! I loved how open of a space it was, however, it was very loud and hard to hold a conversation. \n\nOur waitress was really nice and super knowledgeable with recommendations. I started with a Cactus League drink which was a delicious, fruity, gin-based cocktail. We also got oysters which were super fresh and I loved that they came with so many accompaniments. Unfortunately, a few of our oysters were missing (2 after we counted) and while our waitress did mention she'd take them off for us (which was really nice), we still noticed them later on the bill. Additionally, we ordered some other starters such as the burrata, tuna crudo, and fish dip. The starters were honestly pretty small and pretty underwhelming. The fish dip was my favorite, but I definitely feel I've had better fish dips in Atlanta. The bread service however, was absolutely delicious. The bread was flaky like a croissant and had tons of garlicky buttery goodness on top! We ordered 3 rounds of the bread lol.\n\nFor my main, I ordered the swordfish. The swordfish was absolutely beautiful, flaking as soon as I made a cut. The fish was on a bed of lady peas which also were super delicious and even my leftovers reheated really nicely! \n\nOverall, I was glad to finally check out The Optimist, and it definitely had some star moments like the oysters and mains. I would come back for the happy hour.",

        "text": "This is such a cool, semi-fancy restaurant and bar and my friend and I had such a wonderful time here. It's spacious and well decorated. Our server, Amanda, was WONDERFUL. She had spot on reccs and we relied heavily on them and were not steered wrong. She also was very attuned to us and our experience; offering to replace my drink when I didn't care for it (Duppy Conquerer) and helping me determine a good substitute-- the Glory Days, which reminded me of an upscale margarita. \n\nThe food -- we went a little light last night, but left satisfied. \nHamachi Crudo -- so bright and refreshing, sushi grade fish with yummy and spicy Calabrian chili, and marinated watermelon. 8/10\nShe crab soup -- made with sherry, nice and creamy with chunks of crab and served with a crispy shrimp toast. Amanda helped us split this-- so nice!! Yum! 9/10. \nPeach cobbler pudding cake -- like a light, spongy bread pudding with peaches cooked in it and fresh peaches on top, topped with the most yummy anglaise sauce. Comes with two cakes, so perfect to split. 10/10\n\nGreat place for a fancy girls night, friend catch up, nice cocktails, work dinner, or a date. Valet was $5 + tips and right outside the restaurant. This is an excellent restaurant.",

        "text": "Finally had the opportunity to try The Optimist for my birthday!! First thing, digital payment valet parking which is really easy! We did make a reservation and I would definitely recommend that!\n\nWe got seated quickly and they even seated us with 1 person coming late which was great. Our waitress was quick to bring us water and give us bread service and let me tell you... this bread is kind of holding this place together... it was phenomenal... like soft and warm... just wow\n\nWe got some recs for oysters and they were all really good!!! Overall the service after the beginning was a little slow so it did take a sec to get our oysters and then even order our appetizers and main dishes. For the apps, we got the fish dip, burrata and tuna crudo. The tuna was very fresh and delicious. The burrata was overall kind of small but it was fine! Not stellar. The fish dip was also good but could've used more seasoning. \n\nFor the main, I got the lobster roll and it didn't disappoint. The chips it came with were crispy and well seasoned and it was overall good! The main thing about this place is that at the price point nothing wowed me. Not to mention we got charged for 2 extra oysters we didn't order (waitress said she would remove and didn't) and they didn't do anymore for my birthday (not expected but it is a plus haha)\n\nOverall, this is a 4 because the vibes and bread service are amazing but I think Beetlecat is better",

        "text": "Made reservations during Happy Hour so we could try their happy hour oysters. When we arrived, we were seated in the main dining area. When we inquired about the happy hour deals, we were told that only those seated at the seafood bar could take advantage of the happy hour deals, and those seats are apparently first come, first serve. I wish they had mentioned that somewhere when booking so that we would know.\n\nLuckily, there were two seats available. So we ended up moving over to take those open seats at the bar area. The oysters deal has increased recently, and it's now $1.75 per oyster until 6pm. And only a select few are included in the deal. There were 4 oysters available on this occasion. However, at the bottom of the menu, there's an option for 13 random selections of oysters. We assumed it would be a random selection from all available oysters. Turns out it's simply a mix and match of the four available for happy hour prices. Since that is the case, it makes more sense to simply order what you want instead of leaving it up to them to decide. The random selection ended up being a bunch of tiny oysters that we didn't love as much as the larger ones we would have chosen.\n\nI also tried they punch alcoholic drink that was red wine, rum, pineapple juice, and lemon juice. It basically tasted like a sangria and it was $6. It was ok. Overall, the interior had a nice décor in the main dining room. It was just ok in the seafood area. The servers were polite. There is a parking garage adjacent to the restaurant with $5 valet parking. Unfortunately, since it is detached from the restaurant and it was pouring rain on this day, it makes or a less than ideal walk to the restaurant. I'm sure it's lovely on a nice sunny day. I'm hoping they work on their transparency moving forward.",

        "text": "This is an interesting place. One side is dark and romantic; a high-end restaurant feel. Great for date night. The other side where the oyster bar is has more of a chill vibe, much brighter, seems more for lunches and outings with friends. \nMy bf and I were dressed for the other side, but were sat very close to another party and asked to be moved. They ended up moving us the the casual side. Whatever, we had much better space. Our server came quickly and made and excellent recommendation on the collard greens.\n\nThe potatoes were also good. My other half thought they were great; I say just good. He enjoyed his lobster and our drinks were fine. My 3 stars come from the halibut I ordered. Dry and salty. I made some at home a couple of nights before which made this experience even worse. I should've sent it back, but I didn't feel like making the effort at that time. It's funny though because when asked how our meal was, the server disappeared halfway through my long hesitation \n\nNeedless to say for the $200 bill, my guy and I agree that we won't be returning.",

I had heard about this place from coworkers who like to take guests from out of town here so I was really excited to try it! \n\nWhen we arrived my sister told me her stomach was upset from lunch earlier but, still wanted to come so I ended up eating by myself but having the company was nice! To start they brought out bread and asked about drinks where I decided to try a beer and the waiter ended recommending their Lemon Meringue Pie when I mentioned that I liked sours and it was perfect! I've even tried to find it locally since my visit but no luck yet :( but I guess that just means I'll have to come back! \n\nFor the meal I ordered the red fish, cornmeal hush puppies and their Cara Crakine Chocolate Delice for dessert! Overall, the meal was delicious and the restaurant is beautiful! The hush puppies were actually my favorite part with the special butter they have on the side make it so unique and not like your ordinary hush puppies in the best way. One thing that I also loved is that list their suppliers on their menu which makes you feel good to know where your food is coming from and that they're supporting local and small farms!",

It never disappoints. \n\nMy go-to is the lobster roll, but you honestly can't go wrong. All of the seafood is phenomenal - and even their bread rolls are a constant craving of mine. \n\nI also love the ambiance. You get five star service, and the vibe is very comfortable. It's an upscale spot with a comfortable feel, which can sometimes be hard to find. Some people are casual at the bar and others and dressed formally getting dinner before a nice event. Regardless, you get great service and great food every time.",

The bar tenders were great. I highly recommend the 'high tea' as a libation. \nWe had the she crab soup, the shrimp la plancha (superb!!) , the redfish, and the scallops. My husband was not a fan of the braised greens and I ordered the basmati fried rice with no egg but it was just a tad too citrusy for me. \nThe ambiance was beautiful and the service was great. Our waiter was very helpful and truly made the experience worthwhile. The lobster roll and mussels were our second options and those that ordered them said they were great. I did not try the oysters, but that seems to be a favorite. \nParking was not difficult and a short walk from the valet to the restaurant, so a heel friendly walk for my fellow ladies :) \n\nOur first visit will not be our last. I look forward to the next time.",

        "text": "We were invited to a private dinner with our the law firm we work with and it was amazing! The space is pretty big and they even have a raw bar on site where you see all the fresh seafood on ice. The staff and service is top notch and everyone is  friendly. We started off with a seafood tower that served an assortment of fresh seafood. Such as ahi tuna, smoked fish dip, cocktail shrimp, small lobster tails and raw oysters with plenty of dips to choose to from. We had a three course dinner. First course you had an option of a green apple salad or smoked fish chowder with oysters crackers. The chowder was amazing!!! You get a flavorful creamy taste with peppers, carrots and celery for added texture. Definitely a great start. Second course I chose the artichoke char with a salsa verde sauce. The skin was perfectly crisp and the was seasoned and paired well with the sauce. We had three sides which were hushpuppies, fingerling potatoes and collard greens with bacon. All three sides complement each other. For dessert there was a choice of apple pie pudding with chantilly cream and chocolate peanut pie. I loved the apple pie pudding but not the chocolate pie so much. Overall I enjoyed my first time here and would love come back again when I'm in town.",

        "text": "I've been to the Optimist approximately 10 times in the span of 2017-present era. I like the open, warehouse space and the beautiful bar. Despite the restaurant being bustling yet freezing AC blasting, the service (shout out to Amanda) was so friendly that warms you right up. \n\nDrinks were small but not slow. Had to order the shrimp a la plancha twice. The bread soaked in the creamy flavorful broth that was to die for. If I wasn't this much of a lady (cough cough), I would've licked the bowl. \n\nMussels with a Thai touch: was ok. The expectation was a bit higher as the mussels were not the cleanest and was a bit oily yet not much flavor. Perhaps a slash of coconut milk to add?\n\nMonkfish: very very okay--3/5. A bit flavorless. The mango was a refreshing addition yet the beans were too mushy to taste. def would not order again. \n\nLobster roll: 1/5. For the steep price tag ($46), it was small, cold, dry, flavorless, and less than generous amount of lobster. The roll was not accompanied by the typical lemon-butter sauce to drizzle on top of the roll. T/F, the roll was dry and cold. \n\nOverall: lovely, young professional crowd. Great restaurants and destinations nearby for after din activities. Service, once again, went above and beyond, which was so memorable that became the highlight of our night.",

        "text": "It makes me sad to write this update because I've truly loved The Optimist. While the service here is still great and the ambiance is wonderful, I'm not sure what's going on with it's food lately. For the money I'm spending here, I expect quality food. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case. \n\nThe last time I had dinner here with a few others was in March 2023, and it was a major disappointment. My \"Duck Fat Poached\" Swordfish had raw lentils. When we pointed it out to our waiter, he said that's how the dish is served. No one should ever eat raw lentils. Lentils have always been a part of my diet since I was a child. So, I know that it should be well-cooked. Otherwise, it'll cause health problems. Overall, the $39 entree tasted odd - the combination of garam masala, capers, and (raw) lentil did not go well together.\n\nThe Redfish was plated beautifully, and the fish itself tasted delicious, but everything else on the plate (asparagus, green tapenade, and lemon sabayon) was average. The asparagus was overcooked and mushy.\n\nI figured at least dessert would be worth it. We made the mistake of ordering several Sorbet of the Moment. Holy cow, it tasted like Strawberry Dole Whip. My days dining at The Optimist are unfortunately over.",

We have been waiting a long time to go to The Optimist.. and it was well worth the wait.\nWe went here for my wife's birthday and everything was top notch, from start to finish.\nThey had \"happy birthday\" printed on the menu they provided my wife - which was a simple yet brilliant touch in terms of customer experience!\nOur servers were attentive and well versed with the menu. Their recommendations were on point and they made sure we had a great overall experience.\nNow, coming to the food, we ordered oyesters, the grilled octopus and the shrimp for appetizers. The shrimp was finger licking good! The oysters were fresh and flavorful and the octopus was well balanced in flavor. \nFor our entree we got the red snapped and some garlic parmesan potatoes. The red snapped was a good sized  portion (just enough for 2 people) and the garlic parmesan potatoes were crispy fried and packed with flavor.\n\nWill I go back - Hell yes!!",

The service was great, the restaurant was lively even though we felt like it was intimate enough in a booth. Every dish we had was amazing, food temperature was great, flavors were great- we enjoyed everything. In addition to our waiter ( who was very attentive and kind) I believe it was a manager that stopped by a couple of times to chat with us. Everything felt genuine and welcoming. I have a gluten allergy Sams the waiter made sure he explained dishes to me that were safe. We will definitely go back.",

There's such a variety of shellfish and fish in different forms to enjoy from soups to filets.\n\nFYI the parking is paid valet at The Brady apartment building next door. It's about $5+ tip. On a lively Saturday night, you might have to experience an additional wait of about 15 minutes past your reservation time. Other than that, it was a pleasant experience.\n\nThe drinks were made well and were refreshing. I had the cactus drink and espresso martini. Both were good. FYI the espresso martini was more coffee than cream, but was well balanced. I also had the Branzino with the broccoli and green beans. The Branzino was made into a beautiful filet with very few bones. The head and tail was still attached but you can request it to be removed. The broccoli was well seasoned and cooked nicely. The green beans had the perfect crunch and tasted good with the flavorful garnish on top. Plus, don't forget to order the complimentary, warm bread prior to your meal. It was a nice balance between the slightly sweet butter and fresh sea salt atop. I'd definitely come back here, but I'd make sure to be patient and not severely hungry.",

        "text": "The Optimist has been on my list since before I moved to NYC in 2015. My wife and I had an overall positive experience. Service was stellar, and the ambiance was just right for a casual date night.\n\nThe missing fifth star is from the misalignment we felt between the price we paid, and the flavors/execution we received. Frame of reference is different for everyone, I understand. Having eaten at 3 Michelin star restaurants (NYC, and one in Toronto, spoiled us), we've paid less at one, and just as much at the others. Both exceedingly more delicious that what received at the optimist. \n\nFor instance, $12 for four hush puppies felt very off-putting. I've had a paper bag of 8-10 hush puppies for $5 in my hometown of Charleston, SC, far more delicious than their \"beignet style\". It felt unnecessarily fancied up, for a snack that was already made perfect. I know the price of the fresh, quality seafood they serve is high. But I am confident one can get seafood, in a great setting, just as delicious for a better price. \n\nI will say the appetizer and small plates menu looked delicious! But the wife wanted what they were known for :). We will certainly revisit to try the rest of the small plates and drinks at the bar. The overall opinion is delicious, but it is a place that has brand equity now, so you will pay an inflated price.",

It seats about 16 people, comfortably. \nAll the food was amazing with the exception of the fried oysters that are not pictured, lol. The oysters weren't bad I just prefer raw oysters. The prawn are so tender and juicy. They come plated atop of bread and dressed in this fabulous creamy sauce. They were so delicious. The Spanish Octopus was amazing it comes with picked carrots and onions which were so good I took them home for a late night snack. The Branzino was great. I only had a couple bites of the fish because we also ordered raw oysters and the Maine Lobster Roll so I was a bit stuffed by the time my entree came out. The food and service was great. I'll definitely go back. I'm glad I finally got to check them off my bucket list.",

My friend made a reservation but of course people that said they couldn't come showed up. So they graciously moved us to a bigger table where we could be better accommodated. \n\nI went there with the intent to only try a few things as I was on a psuedo budget but i blew that out of the water , LOL. I had the She crab soup which was divine. And the soft rolls that you get with your dinner? *drool*\nI ordered a lobster roll to go to have for lunch that day. I saw it came with homemade chips and at first i was upset at myself for not offering something else. But baby let me tell you. Those chips were amazing!\n\nTuesday is a busy night, fyi.

There is paid parking nearby and I paid around $4 for two hours. \n\nFor a Saturday happy hour, they did not have any available inside dining besides the bar, but it was nice outside and there was a good amount of patio seating (and they have heaters as well for colder times).\n\nService was spectacular and our server was so knowledgeable and on point. Came by a good amount of times but never over bearing. One critique is she never filled our waters and all of our waters were empty 80% of the way through dinner.\n\nWe ordered 2 baker's dozen of oysters ($19 each), 12 total of the other happy hour oysters ($1.50 each), Fish & Chips ($20), GA Apple Salad ($14), and the Tuna Crudo ($18). \n\nThe oysters here were SOO good. Absolutely to die for. So incredibly fresh and delicious especially for the price. Can't beat it. \n\nMy friends enjoyed the Fish & Chips, but didn't think it was anything too exciting and fries could do with some salt. GA Apple Salad felt like it was missing 'something' to take it to the next level. Tuna Crudo was alright too. \n\nIn the end, oysters were IT here. I'm already planning to be back ASAP for another happy hour!",

        "text": "I've lived in/around Atlanta my whole life. Of course I've heard of the Optimist but I never found a reason to go. Welp! It didn't disappoint. \n\nPrice-wise, its a $$$. We got apps, 2 drinks and meals each and it ran $180 without tip. So it's more of a special occasion place unless you just got it like that. Parking is super easy. The have a cashless valet - you give them your phone number and they text you a link to pay when you are done with your meal. You can also tip on the link. \n\nWe started with just a few oysters and they bring some rolls out. Now, I'm not trying to be a hype beast, and maybe we were just starving but these rolls are delicious. There is salt and butter on top and they are crunchy and warm. The oysters were fresh and delicious - tasted just like the ocean! We also got the octopus and the gumbo to split. My favorite was the octopus. It was beautifully cooked and had really nice flavor. \n\nFor the main event, we got the scallops and monkfish. The monkfish was good but not unique. The plantains were nicely cooked - there was just too much beans. The scallops, however, were incredible. Luckily I got the scallops and my husband got the monkfish, so my meal was better. The scallops were cooked beautifully and the braised beef pairs so well. The sauce was the glue that pulled it all together. \n\nThe drinks were also nice - smooth but very strong. Our server was awesome, and I love to see a restaurant that work as a team. Whenever our water was low, someone can around to refill it. It really takes the service to the next level and creates an awesome energy. Unfortunately it was too cold for us to play putt putt outside, but hoping we can come back in warmer weather to get a shot.\n\nAn ATL staple, and a MUST try!",

        "text": "I've heard great things about this place and was excited to try it out as a fancy date night. However, our experience was mediocre. Valet Parking is now $5.50 plus tip (there is a credit card fee even though there is no option for cash payments). It was raining when we arrived and  I appreciated that there were umbrellas to borrow to go from the valet section to the restaurant. I made an open table reservation which requires a credit card and charges you $25 if you don't cancel 3 days before. Once we got there we were seated but told that due to where we were seated, we could not partake in the happy hour oyster special from 5-6 PM and would have to pay full price for all oysters. Our plan all along was to order the happy hour oysters and then order dinner. \n\nWhen we asked what we had to do for that to be possible they said we had to find an open spot at the oyster bar and that it's first come first serve. We ended up switching seats and the waiter was super nice about it, but, the oyster bar definitely has a different vibe. After oysters we just decided to leave since I didn't really want to eat dinner at the oyster bar and had already given up our seats in the main dining room. We have been to happy hour specials at other restaurants and have never been asked to sit in another section. Even so, all I ask is that this is stated clearly on their website and opentable site so people could plan accordingly and to set expectations. Had I known ahead of time, we would have arrived later and just had dinner. \n\nUnfortunately all the friction I experienced trying to eat here put a bad taste in my mouth. All I wanted was a fun date night and instead I felt like a second class citizen.",

The crackers they give you are delicious and we happened to be there for happy hour which made my day! We got the bakers dozen which was a random selection and we added some additional ones that we wanted to try. Nothing like a freshly cracked oyster and some mignonette! We will definitely be back and try more of their other dishes!",

The food was amazing to me, no complaints about that. The main course did take longer after the appetizers came out (about 45min to be exact) and the server was not interacting with us at all, just dry, his face looked like he just hated his job. Not the best bday experience I thought I was going to have there, not sure if I would go back but if I did, the bar is where the best service is at.",

The oysters were really good and fresh, the smoked fish dip was also delicious. The bread they gave us was also perfect, nice and soft with salted butter. The lobster roll was good too and was served with bbq chips but I would have preferred it with salt & vinegar or regular potato chips instead. The crispy potatoes are as described and didn't disappoint. Last but not least, monkfish had great texture and paired nicely with the veggies. We liked the lobster roll more! \n\nOverall we had a great time and would definitely come back to try new dishes!",

She was so attentive and gave great recommendations! she did recommended great drink pairing to help us have an even better experience.\n\nFood:\nCHEAP SUNGLASSES - light margarita. The tasting notes were just like a margarita with some seltzer to top it off.\n\nWHOLE SHRIMP A LA PLANCHA - MUST GET! Do not be afraid of the head on shrimp because that is where all the flavor is at. Take the bread that is soaking up all the sauce and really enjoy everything this dish has.\n\nGA APPLE SALAD - simple. This was a wonderful and light salad to start out any meal.\n\nBRANZINO - So filling! The fish comes de-boned (only the spine and fins), so it was nice to not worry as much about getting a bit with fine bones in it. The chef can de-head the fish if you wish to not see a face on our plate.\n\nGEORGES BANK SCALLOPS - pass. The braised short rib was the start of the dish, so if the short rib came on the menu, I would get it instead of the scallops. \n\nCRISPY POTATOES - Too many. After such big entre plates, there were just to many potatoes to eat. The seemed as though they were only baked, so they weren't very crispy at all.\n\nCORN MILK HUSHPUPPIES - MUST GET! The sweetness from the powdered sugar and the savory-ness from the corn made this side dish so balanced!\n\nOn to the next food adventure...",
