The waffle itself was sweet starting from the dough, and not too crispy or crunchy, but rather chewy to contrast the crispy of the chicken. Like I said, in love.\n\nLooks like your old town classic diner, and the people treat you jus like one of their own. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit!",

        "text": "Folk Art is absolutely one of my new favorite brunch spots in Atlanta! \n\nFood: The food is great and they have many interesting items on the menu. They do a lot with sweet potatoes here... sweet potato waffles, sweet potato beignets, sweet potatoes pancakes, etc. Get the \"Foul Play\" - Chicken & sweet potato waffle! Sooo good! \n\nPrice: Pretty decent prices on food. Average on drinks. I had the Foul Play (which was a nice portion size) and a mimosa for less than $20. \n\nAtmosphere: It's a lively, colorful, cozy place. Very hipster. You'll more than likely have to wait if you're there for brunch on the weekend, but it's not  too long. \n\nService: Great! The food came out pretty quick. Folk Art has complimentary valet parking, which is awesome because it's in area that's mostly street parking. \n\nOverall: Give it a shot!",

Really interesting takes on traditional southern/brunch dishes. Seems to be care put into this food. \n\nThe grit fritters (I could eat a couple of orders of these alone!), sweet potato donut holes ( very sweet I need to share an order), huevos rancheros (a little spicy but with a purpose not just for pain), and southern fried folk (honestly some of the best gravy I've had in a while) were all so perfect. I'll definitely be back. \n\n\nThe grapefruit cooler was good too!!",

Sat at the bar, ordered the Foul Play, and people watched. Foul Play was probably one of the best chicken waffles presentations I've had for a couple reasons: \n\nWaffle is thin & flavorful \nPretty sure it was a sweet potato waffle at that\nTopped with a fried chicken breast, seasoned to perfection and not overcooked\nThen that was topped with a peach compote. absolutely amazing! \n\nOh yeah, my meal was only $10. I didn't feel like I walked out overly full eventhough I definetly cleared my plate.",

Would I go again?! Huh? Did you read the first part of my review?! \n\nAbsolutely I would go again and then again!!!! The folk chicken and gravy meal was amazing!!!! The gravy was super delicious! The biscuits were big and fluffy and chicken was very tender!!! The egg was a nice surprise and while I don't typically like a soft fried egg, it didn't take away from the experience! \n\nI also ordered the peaches with chicken and a waffle and yum once again! The peaches in the compote were the star of the meal! The chicken was good but the compote made it delicious! The waffle was okay but it was made better by the compote! Are you sensing a theme here? Yup, its the compote! It's everything! Trust me! \n\nI didn't get an opportunity to try the chicken sandwich that everyone is talking about but I absolutely will when I return! FYI dine if you can, GrubHub is ridiculous with their numerous hidden fees. TRUST!",

If you can't find parking on the street, you can valet. \n\nI ordered the cinnamon sticky bun French toast with hash browns and a side of bacon. The French toast is awesome and really tastes like a cinnamon bun. The hash browns and bacon were delicious as well. I also ordered a smoked honey bourbon cocktail that was divine. It wasn't too sweet and it was pretty strong.\n\nThe staff here has always been friendly and this visit was no exception.

        "text": "We wanted local Southern Food while we were in Atlanta, and yelp reviews here looked great! We went here at 1pm on a Saturday and were told it was a 35 minute wait. We figured that was manageable. After 40 minutes I asked the hostess our spot in line and she said 4 people were in front of me. After I witnessed 5 parties get called their turn, I asked when we would be seated and was told there were we were next. THEN SHE CALLED ANOTHER PARTY IN. Finally we are called and we literally waited an hour. So now I am beyond starving and so excited for my food. Service was decent, and my husband did LOVE his chicken sandwich, but I did not care for the southern fried chicken. The gravy was very sweet, which I did not expect. I can't say that I would ever go back or recommend this place. It's not worth the hour wait or hassle of being told you are next in line 5 different times!",

The interior of the restaurant has an old-timey feel and the outdoor seating is perfect on a sunny day. \n\nWe arrived on a Sunday late afternoon and there was a slight wait (this place can get packed). No worries tho because their breakfast items can be ordered anytime. \n\nStaff was super friendly and we got our food quickly. I ordered the chicken and waffles dish which was the perfect blend of sweet and savory. The chicken was deliciously fried and tasted fresh. There was also a peach compote with the dish which added a nice touch to my meal. \n\nNext time I will definitely try a lunch option. I saw many sandwich and burger items on the menu. I can't wait till my next visit!!!",

They somehow made the space, which is on the bottom floor of a 1970 office building that once housed the now defunct Art Institute of Atlanta School, look like a remodeled older building with exposed brick walls and octagon tile on the floor. \nThe menu has been slightly updated but the favorites are still there, like all day breakfast including Sweet Potato pancakes, waffles and beignets! My fave is the roasted pork & chili verde. Brunch was favorite at Inman Park and will be here.\nDinner and lunch items are upgraded versions of diner food. Good bye Pastries a No No",

But minus half Star for the food and parking situation.\n\nFirstly, parking is notorious in this area, of you have difficulty finding a spot, drive up to the valet. Shell out some money for the boys that park your car.\n\nThe wait for Saturday brunch at 25 mins is fairly decent. Lucky for us, there are cinema benches to rest it just wander along the route to peek into other establishments. The hostess will yell out your name when it's your turn, you won't miss her calling your name.\n\nWhen she yelled our name, we were down to a table near the bar. This restaurant uses all the space available. Lol\n\nSomeone took our drink order and disappeared quickly then she appeared again at the table next to ours. Clearly she's well versed with the size of the crowd. After giving us sufficient time to peruse the menu, she appeared again! Timely!!!\n\nOur food came quickly! Kudos to the kitchen!! My shrimp and grits looked nice but i didn't like it as much as others I've tried. First there were green bell and red bell peppers, secondly, it was too saucy and there was not enough grits to soak up the gravy. If there were more grits, the size wouldn't taste so salty.  The sweet potato pancakes was way too crispy for my liking though my husband loved it \n\nI might come back a second time to try other items to make a new judgement s to whether i would scratch it off my breakfast restaurant list.",

        "text": "After not agreeing on any of the restaurants we had on our list, we finally said \"screw it let's go here\" and we were both SO GLAD we did! Seating is a little snug but we made friends with our table neighbor. Our server was very sweet and the food was incredible! The chicken was juicy, flavorful, and perfectly fried. The sausage gravy was absolutely amazing. Not so rich that it overpowered the meal, but rather fairly light (for a gravy lol) and very flavorful. The pork in my sandwich was tender and moist and the collard cole slaw was amazing! I'm not a huge fan of slaw and was surprised that I loved it as much as I did. I also had a mango mimosa that was very tasty, but overpriced. Everything was so good and my boyfriend scraped his plate clean!",

When i walked in, a sign in the front said please wait to be seated, but no one ever came by so I seated myself. I had coffee (hot and good) and a waffle with chicken w/ peach compote on the side.  I'm so glad it was on the side because it wasn't really good. The waffle was flat so I would choose something else if I ever go back.  The pleasant surprise (sarcasm) was an $18 parking fee, which I would try and park on the street next time since I was truly surprised about that.  That's not the restaurants fault, but yikes. The fried green tomatoes are good with blue cheese crumbles.",

That flat top Mac and cheese gives you the ooey gooey + crunch that you crave from baked Mac and cheese and it's perfect! Service was awesome as well. It's a really small place so squeezing between tables especially after having eaten all that damn food was a bit challenging  otherwise highly recommend you pay a visit!",

I found some time this past week and took advantage as my time to check them out. \n\nI went as soon as they opened, so finding seating was pretty easy. I was greeted by a friendly server as soon as I sat down. I ordered the Foul Play, which is Chicken and Waffles. The food came out rather quickly, putting the overall service for this establishment as an A+ in my book. My food was good. The chicken was seasoned decently and my eggs were cooked exactly as I asked.  Not sure what they used but I absolutely fell in the love with the syrup they used. \n\nOverall I would visit here again. They have some other good options that I look forward to trying in the near future.",

My mom ordered the Veggie Omelette that was perfect she said!! My little one e loved the Cinnemon Waffle , it was perfect because it was thin unlike some other versions that are thick like Belgium.

        "text": "Oh folk art how I love your breakfast. By far the lobster Benedict is the winner. The best lobster Benedict in Atlanta! It's seasoned and cooked perfectly . Their huevos rancheros were really good, crunchy flavorful and just plain delicious! Make sure to come before 11 am to get breakfast! The sweet potato pancakes were nasty-heavy and dry. The hash browns seemed like they came straight from the supermarket freezer. The waiter described them like Waffle House hash brown and he didn't lie maybe even worse as in a place like folk art I would expect better quality. \n\nTheir lunch is also really good and affordable. My husband had the shrimp po boy which was Amazing!!! Shrimp was flavorful fried to perfect crispy State! The fries were also good! I had the grill cheese it's been voted to be the best in Atlanta. Although really good I guess I expected more but might be that I make a really good girl cheese at home. It's the best I've tried outside my house but would order the shrimp po boy before the grill cheese. The tomato soup was delightful with the sandwich and I'm not a tomato soup fan. Great job! I had the Mac and cheese and thought it was only ok. \n\nIn sum must get:\nBreakfast-lobster Benedict and huevos rancheros \nLunch - shrimp po boy \n\nParking is tricky in the neighborhood as your car will get towed in residential parking only, at night it's worth parking in the valet and tipping a couple dollars. During weekdays morning and early afternoon there's no valet so it's free parking!! Yeah!!",

Kind of small but in a good way.\n\nA million things on the menu and they all sound delicious. I wanted one of everything almost. Landed on the banana nut French toast + grapefruit mimosas. So delicious! I wanted to order more but was stuffed. I'll definitely be back soon.",

But we saw so many great options we couldn't leave without trying out Folk Art. \n\nThe atmosphere and restaurant are really cute, a great brunch or lunch location in a beautiful neighborhood.\n\nEverything on the menu sounded delicious but there are clear cut fan favorites. So we trusted them and went with the lobster rolls w/ a side of friends and the Bad to The Bone sandwich w/ a side of Mac and cheese. Could not have been more satisfied with our choices. \n\nThe lobster rolls were buttery and the lobster salad itself was fresh and tasty. The tomatoes on top were a little lackluster and not as fresh as i would have wanted them to be. The fries were delicious. \n\n\nThe bad to the bone sandwich was so good, a great combination of flavors. Onions, collard greens and pulled pork, not too saucy and just the right amount of every flavor. Mac was so good, crunchiness and creaminess all in one. \n\nOur server was very helpful and kind.\n\nOverall such a nice experience and a very enjoyable lunch on a beautiful day.",

The peach compote wasn't sweet enough for me but it was still good.\n\nThey have fun appetizers like bacon dipped in pancake batter and sweet potato beignets. We ordered the deep fried jalepeno cheese grits balls which is something I've never seen before! \n\nAlso a great place to find celebrities!

The food and drinks we had were delicious. \n\nThe only bad thing about folk art, which isn't even their fault, is I spent a lot of time driving around finding a spot on the street - but we went here on a Saturday night so it was also expected. Folk Art has valet parking but the lot looked full. Servers were nice and when we went it was seat yourself which was fine. The whole restaurant is painted inside with R.

We waited for about 30 mins until we were seated. Immediately we were seated we were informed that we couldn't take off our masks until the server had taken all our orders which was perfectly okay. We waited for about 10 minutes before our server came over. We asked for recommendations and ended up getting the I dream of weenie, fried pickles and pimento cheese dip. The dream of weenie was too salty and I would rather eat a plain hotdog than that. The fried pickles was just okay. The pimento cheese dip crackers were soft and stale. We were disappointed of course but were still excited to try the main brunch since it had really great reviews. For my meal I had the fried chicken sandwich plus a sunny side up egg. I was excited because the reviews were pretty good. Honestly, I'm not sure if it's the same sandwich people write about but it was very bland and underwhelming. I couldn't even eat the meal. My friend had the foul play which I ate out of and had the same feelings like I did with the chicken sandwich.",

The chicken was a boneless breast. It was fried perfectly, very tender and juicy. The problem was that it wasn't seasoned. I was expecting some salt from the chicken to offset all of the sweetness from the peach topping and syrup. It was disappointing. My wife had the French toast and had no complaints.

We also had Maple syrup on the side for dipping. We didn't really need the syrup but ate some anyway. Next I selected the s'mores French toast with eggs and bacon. My friend  had the Fried Chicken Biscuit  with the collard green cole slaw.\n\nAll of these dishes were very good and the mimosas were excellent! The prices are extremely reasonable for this area. Valet parking service made getting in and out a piece of cake. \n\nTry it, you'll like it!!",

During my last visit 3 days ago, I had to continuously get up to ask for things. Afterwards, instead of a pleasant brunch, I was exhausted from begging for more water, another drink, condiments, etc. Also, the servers will walk right by without checking on their tables (intentionally ignoring). By the way, I'm not the type to ask for a lot. \n\nLet's please get back to outstanding customer service. Thx",

The wall art and ambiance was cool as well. Somewhat overpriced but overall a nice place to eat at.",

They charged us 18% for service, in addition to the tipping. Although we just had a party of 3. We waited 1 hour to get into the restaurant and 1.5 hours to get the food. They charged us $ 3.5 for coffee that was very old and we never received a refill. The food was very ordinary. If you want a good brunch, I highly recommend you to do more search and find another place. The only good thing were the host who was super friendly and polite and the person who seemed to be a veteran server (she helped us, otherwise who knows when we would get service?!).",

        "text": "This place had a few issues with execution but overall, brunch was enjoyable.\n\nWe started with the sweet potato beignets. Our first batch was crispy and hard but the flavor was excellent! When the overly fried balls came to our server's attention, he got us a fresh batch that was soft and much better than the first one.\n\nAfter seeing the chicken and waffles picture I knew that I was going to try that. Others had the patty melt, folks southern fried, bananas foster waffle, veggie sandwich, and cinnamon pecan sticky bun french toast. For the most part, the food was very good and the portions were substantive. \n\nThe folks southern fried chicken and biscuits was covered in a sausage gravy that was thick and flavorful. The issue with that dish was the biscuits, which were too hard to really enjoy. The sweet potato waffle had a wonderful flavor but it was quite thin. A nice piece of chicken topped it though so it was enough food for me.\n\nService was really good and considering the fact that they let 2 people in our party of 8 sit for a half hour occupying two tables on a Saturday morning during a torrential downpour without any hesitation, I can't complain at all about the hospitality here. Our server tried to make everything right, which we really appreciated.",

As for the food, it's wonderful that you enjoy the flavors the chicken and waffles and sweet potato beignets. It's good we could replace the initial beignets since they weren't to our normal standard. I wish you'd loved all parts of your meal as much as the service and taste. On that note, I appreciate you brining the texture of the biscuits to my attention. I'd like to figure out why they weren't to our normal quality.\n\nWhat was the date of your meal?\n\nBest,\nJason Hill, Owner",
