        "text": "IF you've never eaten here, it should be on your list. This was my second time eating at South City Kitchen and first at this location. I previously had brunch at the other location near Sandy Springs, and it's still one of my higher ranked brunch spots.\n\nWe did valet parking and only had to tip. You'll probably want to wear something semi-dressy, as this tips the scales as being closer to fine dining. Ambiance and mood is very relaxed.\n\nOur table did a few appetizers: fried green tomatoes, crab cakes and Gouda fritters (along with the house muffins and biscuits). All of it was amazing! The Gouda fritters were my favorite. I had a blood orange beer on tap that tasted more like a Weiss beer and it was good. Their old fashioned was also very good!\n\nMy entree, the Carolina trout, was just ok. Not enough fish to satisfy and just wasn't cooked to my liking. However, I had a bite of someone's strip steak and it was absolutely fantastic! Our waitress was stellar!\n\nOverall, a great experience! I would highly recommend eating here for a company dinner or date night.",

        "text": "Was there for brunch recently.  The valet was closed so we parked in the garage ($14, no validation).  I had coffee.  My wife had an Aperol spritz and a latte.  She said that here drinks were good.  My coffee was fine.\n\nThe corn muffins are quite good.  Not too sweet and great texture with a crispy outside.  They put cinammon in the apple butter.  My wife likes that; I don't.\n\nI started with the she-crab soup.  This was delicious.  Rich with excellent crab flavor and a few chunks of lump crab.  You could taste the sherry but it was not overpowering.  That is a really great soup.\n\nThen we waited.  We waited about 25 minutes for our entrees.  My wife had the crab rice and I had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and collards.  Her crab rice was meh.  There was a sour flavor that might have been due to the aoli.   The fried chicken is technically perfect.  You get a airline breast.  The crust was crispy and the meat juicy.  The chicken is underseasoned and bland though.  Unfortunately, the potatoes were also gummy and underseasoned.  A fail.  The collards are good...not outstanding but fine.\n\nWe skipped dessert.  Yelp does not allow half-points and South City Kitchen Buckhead is more like a 3 1/2 for me.  The soup was excellent.  Our server did a great job but the kitchen took much to long to serve the mains.  The main dishes were meh.  Sorry about the photos.  I started both dishes before I remembered to take a pic.",

        "text": "Out of all the places we ate at on our Georgia trip, I would say South City Kitchen Buckhead was our favorite, however, it is more on the upscale side for southern food. There was a party going on when we came, so just in case you should make a reservation to ensure you don't have to wait. We were lucky when we arrived on a Friday night because they had a free table for 3. \nAfter we ordered, they started us off with complementary bun and corn bread. I'm not sure what kind of bread it was, but the bun was super soft and airy.\nPei Mussels ($16) - included andouille sausage, white wine, chili flakes, with grilled baguette. The sauce makes a great dip for bread.\nShe-Crab Soup in a bowl ($10) - included cream sherry, pieces of real crab meat, with olive oil drizzle. \nSpringer Farm Fried Chicken ($25) - included a fried white meat chicken breast, collard greens, mashed red bliss, honey-thyme potatoes. I usually don't like white meat because it's on the dry side, but this chicken was juicy and well-seasoned. The collard greens were good, and the mashed potato was creamy.\nSide of Fried Okra ($7) - My friends enjoyed this more than me because I am not a fan of the slimy interior of okra.\nService was smooth, so we did not have to wait long for food. This was a great last dinner here!",

        "text": "This spot is a joint that has no weakspots when it comes to food.  The service, elite.  The ambience, a vibe.  The food, elevated tier.  The bar situation, solid. They have a downstairs and an upstairs.  The upstairs area you can get a view of Peachtree road so its a nice ambience there.  \n\nThe bar area there is decently big but they have a lot of selection for you (and some nice specials on the menu to boot).  \n\nThe waitstaff is always stellar.  They haven't missed.  They will be prompt with you and in the downtime they will stop and talk to you instead of throwing your food on the table and bouncing away.  Makes you feel like a person instead of a table number.\n\nOn my last visit I got the king biscuit and it was NOT what I expected (I guess I expected a biscuit sandwich of some sort).  This was not it, but it was a welcomed surprise.  Kind of an opened faced sandwich situation that had MAD flavor!\n\nThere is parking but its valet, so just be aware.  Its like 2 dollars, so it isnt that bad, but dont expect a lot of street parking, it is on Peachtree RD so I assume you already know how that is.  That should not deter you though!  If you havent, you need to dabble in this!",

I'm glad we came -- everything we ate was tasty, the server attentive, and nice ambiance (white tablecloths, not noisy). When we said we were from out of town, our server recommended three classic southern dishes that are popular - fried green tomato's, shrimp & grits, and the fried chicken. All were great--especially the shrimp & grits. The grits were creamy and the sauce had a slight kick. The cocktail - ugly sweater - mentioned gin & earl gray so I was excited but it was overpowered by whatever citrus was used (lemon?)\n\nWe had a meal for two - appetizer, entree, dessert and cocktails - for $140 including tip. Quite reasonable!",

        "text": "We had a family lunch set up but really wanted some southern specialties, so we did brunch before lunch here.  The patio sounded unappealing on a 15 degree F cold spell Sunday morning, but it's actually a beautiful covered / enclosed patio with heaters and a fireplace, and I would argue it's nicer than the inside since there's lots of natural light. \n\nI started with an Up & At Em: a gin based brunch cocktail - super light and refreshing with kumquat. \n\nThey start you with warm cornbread and biscuits, which are amazing. The biscuit was so fluffy, nicely salted, good with their peach jam.\n\n- Fried green tomatoes: layered with with goat cheese and fried, sitting on a red pepper coulis. It was nicely fried with a thin crisp cornmeal crust and not too greasy. Loved the goat cheese tang with it \n- Fried chicken and waffles: one of their specialties. The chicken was nicely brined, flavorful and super moist (white meat). You can add pecans to the waffles for $2, which adds a nice crunch. The waffle was fluffy.\n\nService was pretty quick and very friendly. It was a great place for elevated southern specialties and brunch. Again, get a seat on the patio if you can!\n\nParking: valet is free if you're dining there. No validation for the paid parking lot.",

        "text": "Visited South City Kitchen on a Friday night - I did have a reservation so I was seated very quickly. The ambiance was nice, very quiet and intimate as the restaurant has small rooms versus one large dining area so overall it had a great ambiance. My server introduced herself and gave us a great description of the restaurant and the signature menu items. She also gave great insight to drink pairings. Our service the entire night was amazing. \n\nFor starters I ordered the Farmstead Gouda Fritters and the She-Crab soup. The Fritters were absolutely delicious - so creamy on the inside but nice and crispy and the honey  glaze was perfectly balanced. I would definitely order this again and again. The soup was so delicate, light and creamy. I really enjoyed the soup. \n\nFor my entree I ordered the Chatel Farms Strip Steak (medium), Shrimp and Marsh Hen Mill Grits and the Fried Okra. The steak was nicely cooked however a bit bland on flavor, the fingerling potatoes and grilled baby gem were delicious. The Shrimp & Grits was very tasty and had perfect ratios of the gravy to grits. The okra was perfect crispy and the sauce that comes with it was light and savory. I would definitely visit again to try the brunch menu. \n\nWould recommend for a quiet, intimate date night.",

It was super packed because of the holiday weekend so we sat at the bar. That was all us though because we didn't have a reservation. The ambiance was beautiful as well as the atmosphere.

The bartenders and bar backs are hustling as they are really busy, and still able to pay great attention to their bar full of clientele. I think I waited about 15 min for a seat at the bar. Not too bad. And I was offered to order a drink by 2 separate bartenders. So they are on point! Open kitchen as well. You do t really see it from the bar but as I was walking out I saw 5 fried chicken dishes ready to serve as well as about 5 pork chops. Those pork chops sure looked good!\n\nI ordered the fried green tomatoes and their fried chicken. And the corn bread & biscuit basket was delish!\n\nThe fried green tomatoes were amazing! Nice golden fry on them and they were also \"stuffed\" with goat cheese. They were wading in a shallow bath of a delicious red pepper coulis, drizzled with olive oil. Very good!!! I could have used more olive oil but I ate it up too fast before I had a chance to ask for oil. \n\nThe fried chicken was accompanied by buttery red bliss mashed potatoes (YUM!!!), and collard greens. The chicken had a great fry on it, but I would have liked it if it was a little more juicy. That being said, I would defiantly order it again. The potatoes were amazing and used more butter than Julia Childs. Good on them! They were delicious while still not too rich. The collard greens were good as well. I would have liked a little bit of fat in them (bacon/pork belly, pancetta, guanciale, etc.). Reflecting back it did counter the butter which might be the reason they were not too rich. Overall, again, I would order the dish again. \n\nI didn't order dessert but the banana pudding seemed to be the house special. Maybe I'll try it next time. \n\nParking is available in the attached (sort of) parking garage. Unfortunately they do not validate, but not a deal breaker. Parking was $14 for the duration of my meal.",

A riff on an old fashioned called \"It had to be you\" (A Frank Sinatra reference). Perfectly balanced and delicious served with a big cube of crystal clear ice.\n\nAfter a quick rundown of the ASW bourbons we tucked into a buffet of BBQ. They had all the meats. Tritip, pulled pork, chicken, sausage, even head cheese. Of course the pickles and traditional sides made an appearance as well. All the food was great, the drinks especially so. I always look for South City when I hit up food festivals, they always put out good food.",

Brimming with welcoming energy and enthusiasm, he helped make this dining experience feel like we were sitting in our own kitchen. \n\nSouth City is known for its fried green tomatoes, so we began our meal with the perfectly battered, goat-cheese filled appetizer. A little history lesson for you: surprisingly, fried green tomatoes were first introduced to the States by Jewish immigrants in the 19th century, only having been made popular by the movie with the namesake in 1991. For my main course, I ate the smoked pork belly covered in a ground mustard, tender and juicy with every bite. I loved it! This was accompanied by the grape salad, which wasn't my favorite. There was a sweetness to the smoked pork belly, so next time I plan on opting for a more savory side like the Caesar salad. Grapes are good for wine, and that's the my favorite form a grape! \n\nSouth City Kitchen is an Atlanta staple. It stays true to Atlanta's southern roots, just not a mom-and-pop and a little more wearing your Sunday best. South City Kitchen serves a mean brunch as well, so tell your gal pals.",

Our friendly server stopped by to take our beverage order and to drop off a bread basket, which was really the highlight of the meal, in my opinion.  Its contents included buttery, soft biscuits and heavenly corn muffins in which you could see the fresh kernels.  My entrée of the Chef's Chicken Chopped Salad was packed with local greens, pecan-smoked bacon, peppadews, tomatoes, cucumbers, feta, and sugar snap peas; I have to say that I love a salad with a bunch of ingredients.  However, the included grilled chicken was rather bland and a bit chewy.  It reminded me of pre-sliced chicken strips you would buy at the supermarket.  The balsamic vinaigrette and green goddess dressing helped add some flavor, but I still found the salad just mediocre; perhaps I did not order the right thing to evaluate the SCK food?\n\nOverall, I found South City Kitchen to be fine, but did not live up to the rave reviews I had seen/heard.",

The staff is friendly, attentive, and engaged with their customers. They take time with you and seem very invested in making your meal a great experience. Second, this place has a wonderful ambiance and good energy that makes your meal feel more special. And last but not least, the food is very good. I can't say enough about the friend chicken or fried  green tomatoes,  it the baked goods, crab cakes, salads, and sandwiches  have all been perfectly executed and nicely presented. Their cocktails also reflect a great attention to detail and craft. \n\nI'm a big fan of great execution and I'm blown away by South City's consistency. If there was one knock I'd offer it's a bit more diversity on the menu along with more frequently specials and seasonal rotation. Beyond that, if you're looking for a great contemporary southern dining experience or a place for a specI'll meal, South City Kitchen is a fine choice.",

My server, Ieesha, was very friendly and attentive. The manager also helped out with clearing plates which I think was also nice and welcoming. The decor is super cute and there's 'patio' seating that offers great views and lots of natural lighting. I started with the fried green tomatoes and they were phenomenal. Anything that comes with goat cheese is a win for me! My entree was the chicken and waffles. The waffle was malted so it was very light and soaked up the syrup. The chicken was well seasoned and juicy. Don't let me forget my Bellini. There's valet parking for only $2!! Can't beat that! I love it here and will definitely be returning!",

        "text": "If you are looking for upscale southern cooking then you've come to the right chain. Not being a southern native I wanted to check out some of the highly rated dishes including fried green tomatoes. I thought they were executed well and nicely seasoned. I also really enjoyed their bread basket, especially their corn bread because they had corn kernels. I got one of the seasonal dishes the Carolina gold (mushroom and corn) risotto, which had a great texture. The risotto was very rich and probably had more cream and butter than I care to know. I couldn't finish it because I'm not used to eating such rich food. My partner had the fried chicken which was done well but not super exciting. \n\nThere did seem to be a distinction in service and seating of people who come without reservations vs those who were having a work lunch. Things were brought out pretty slowly and we weren't checked on often despite it being a Monday at lunchtime and for the price and location I felt a little disappointed.",

Me and my family came here for the first time the weekend of the Beyoncé concert. They had valet parking or you could south park in the parking deck across the walkway. I'm so happy that I was able to make a reservation online because it was packed. We did still have to wait because they have a policy that your full party has to be present in order to seat you, understandable. Once everyone arrived, we were seated in their outside cabana area. We decided to start off with the mimosa carafe, which was very strong and delicious! The complementary corn bread and biscuits was to die for! The orange marmalade that comes with it is unforgettable. Our party ordered a variety of different dishes from salmon to chicken and waffles to the smothered biscuit. Everything was great! I will definitely be returning. The ambience and vibe on the outside of the restaurant was very relaxing with the overhead fans, while you watched the views from the street. This restaurant is definitely on my list now for brunch.",

We ordered a few apps. The lump crab cake, pork belly, and pimento cheese. Everything was delicious. As an entree I had the pork chop and it did not disappoint.

I would say it was lacking for the price. three pieces of each dry ham three pieces of a Genoa. Pickled tomatoes and okra and no cheese on the board. we told the waiter no cheese, and he went and got us three pieces of cheese. really sad. We followed up and split the fried chicken. did not taste like buttermilk fried, the shrimp and grits were good but not the best. and the fried green tomatoes were only three pieces and were good. I would say the service was just ok. no real attention to detail, and one thing that really bugged me about the wait staff is that they kept coming by and trying to take our plates away while we were still eating.

Wonderful flavor. The Nashville fried chicken was also excellent - the bun was a little much so mostly ate the fried chicken without the roll. I would order it again for sure. The house made chips were ok not great but ok - if I were to visit again I would order the fries.",

        "text": "Was excited for southern food here, and regret not trying the fried green tomatoes. Rounding my average 3.5 rating up to a 4 here. My partner and I ordered the Springer Mountain Farms Fried Chicken & Buttermilk Waffle, and the Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich, plus Banana Pudding Trifle for dessert -\n \nTASTE: 3/5 - we enjoyed the bowl of biscuits and corn muffins, w morsels of corn in them, to start, plus butter and a sweet cinnamon(?) spread. My fried chicken and waffle were good, but especially when doused w the Vermont maple syrup. The pulled pork BBQ sandwich was alright, and its side of BBQ sauce and well-seasoned chips were better. We loved the strong banana and dulce de leche flavors in the pudding. Overall, our meal was okay but we thought it'd dazzle us more \nTEXTURE: 3/5 - my waffle was perfectly made and the fried chicken also had a great crisp, however we were disappointed by how dry the pulled pork was and the choice of a ciabatta bun (I love the softness of brioche). Wish we got more of the candied corn puffs layered throughout the pudding, not just the vanilla wafers \nPRICE: 4/5 - expected prices for brunch \nSERVING SIZE: 4/5 - filled us up for lunch \nSERVICE: 3/5 - didn't mind being seated at the bar since we walked in at noon on a Saturday. However, the plates still had some food residue on them and our waiter gave us our bill without asking if we'd like dessert after our entrees\nATMOSPHERE: 4/5 - a nice, large space w modern decor\nPARKING: 4/5 - when you pass South City Kitchen on Peachtree Rd, turn right and the valet station will be on your right, past the SCK doors. Valet parking was $2, without tip!",

The complimentary biscuits and cornbread with strawberry jam were an amazing start. The Springer Mountain Farms Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes and collard greens hit the spot for me. The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and deliciously juicy on the inside. The smashed red potatoes and slightly sweet and smoky greens complemented the dish. Service was good but slightly slow. We had a resevation and only waited about 5 minutes to be seated on the covered mezzanine level. Complimentary valet parking is available.",

They are known for their fried chicken so I had high expectations. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed. The chicken was cooked properly and was juicy/tender.
