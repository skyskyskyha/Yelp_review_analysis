        "text": "cooks and soliders is a popular tapas spot in west midtown and has been on my list to try for a long time now. the vibe is great and place is spacious. the service is solid and very friendly. some of the tapas were hit or miss for me. i saw a ton of pics of the bikini which made me order it (i likely wouldn't have ordered it otherwise). the bikini was the star of the show for me. it was like an adult Spanish grilled cheese. so simple yet delicious. i wasn't a huge fan of the patatas bravas. i thought they were a little too large for me and not super crispy. i personally like them when they're quartered. the gambas were pretty good, but wish it came with more! i also really enjoyed the berenjenas. it reminded me a lot of a Mediterranean dish with the wood grilled eggplant and crispy chickpeas. \n\noverall, it was a good experience and dinner. if i came again, i would probably order different items and maybe even venture out into non-tapas items.",

        "text": "This was a very interesting experience. I'll separate this review and rate the food and the service separately. I'll start with the better end which is the food. This menu is not really very suited for someone like me that doesn't eat red meat but I was pleasantly surprised that the few options I did have were done to perfection. I ordered the Marmitako which is ahi tuna and a bite of this halted my who conversation with my friend because it was so good. The seasoning was just perfect along with the sauce and the little potatoes in it were so yummy. I also had the gambas al  ajillo which is garlic shrimp and again, this was done to perfection. I should've stopped there. I ordered the cheesecake and it was odd then it was bad. The strawberries tasted like smoked meat and it was gross. I was so disappointed because dessert is my favorite part. Overall I gave the food a 4  because the dessert was bad. My friend's lemon bar was odd too because the crust was not good. But she liked all her main food too and was able to order way more than me. \nThe staff needed help. Never really felt welcome and the greeters with the exception of the main one I spoke with were not very professional or pleasant. Our server made us feel like we were a nuisance for wanting to order and for a tapas restaurant that is a normal thing to keep adding more items. It seemed like he and many of the other workers didn't want to be there. So based on the service I'd give that side a 2. \nSo even tho my mains were sooooo yummy, based on the staff it is very unlikely I would return.",

It's fancy, but not overpriced and there's free valet parking attached to the restaurant. \n\nOur waitress was awesome and gave us complimentary wine to start to celebrate the birthdays. For entrees, we decided to share 11 plates between 6 of us. My favorites were the patatas bravas, bone marrow, mountain bread, and chistorra in a blanket (basically fancy pigs in a blanket with an amazing honey mustard sauce), but most of what we had was pretty good. \n\nFor dessert we split everything on the menu with the rest of the party and my favorite one was the basque cheesecake followed closely by the orange pie. After meals and dessert, the total came to around $50 per person, which isn't too bad for a nice dinner out. \n\nOverall I would recommend cooks and soldiers for a nice dinner and will definitely add this to my list of favs!",

I feel that it's important to begin with these are the best tapas potatoes you'll ever have. Don't mess with the Barcelona potatoes down the street,  these have the most amazing crisp. \n\nWe also had a number of great tapas, mussels (sauce was slap your mama good), the octopus (pretty damn good with the perfect char), crudo (good but fishy), those little grilled cheese sammies that had amazing truffle rubbed all over them. \n\nThe cocktails are amazing as well, I had the best gin and tonic of my life (not even kidding)",

They gave us some drink suggestions based on our personal tastes, and stopped by to make sure everything was alright. And the food!! The barbacoa had a burst of flavor, and was so tender. The bikini was delicious, but I would have preferred a little less truffle oil since the excess would seep in my mouth with every bite. All in all, this was such a great experience, and I definitely plan on coming back!",

They have $5 gin & tonics, which is nice, but for food, they only offer 3 different bites (literal bites) of food for $1, and you can only get one bite per drink.\n\nI got the Vegetarian Bikini (grilled cheese with truffle, $9). It was very, very good. I dipped it in the Ibérico Albondigas sauce and that was delicious too.\n\nNote on parking - valet at the deck off of 14th street and get your ticket validated at the host stand. Valet took cash, card, and even Venmo. Valet closes when the restaurant closes.\n\nCool atmosphere. Nice light fixtures. Good for a date!\n\nWhile I won't go again for happy hour, I'll definitely go back to try more items on the menu! Their cocktails looked really good, so I can't wait to try those!",

        "text": "Made a reservation (highly recommend) for dinner here for 3. They called the day before to confirm the reservation. My friends got there earlier and it was easy for them to get seated. They had several drinks each which they enjoyed but I chose not to partake tonight. The ambience of the restaurant feels quite hip and trendy but also classy. Exactly the spot you would want if you were there for a birthday or a special occasion or a date.\n\nWe got a multitude of dishes. The scallops were the most average of the dishes. It didn't have the sear or flavor I would like in a scallop and the sauce didn't do much for the dish. This would be the only dish I would pass on. The mountain bread had a nice texture and came with a lovely butter. The butter was slightly on the saltier side for my taste but not to the point where I didn't enjoy it. The beef tongue which is a special currently (they have a small side menu of specials) was delicious. It had a beautiful sear outside and had a lovely soft texture inside. The bone marrow was solid, though the bone we got wasn't very deep and I didn't feel like we got our monies worth compared to other peoples bones but that's a small point.  The Argentinians shrimp dish was okay in terms of the texture of the shrimp. The real star of the dish was the sauce it came with, the shrimp sauce paired very well with the bread it came with. I would recommend dish solely for the sauce! One of my favorite for the night was the mushroom toast. It had a delicious creamy element from the cheese and a nice meaty texture from the mushrooms. It also had a great earthly profile from the truffle. The croquetas are exactly what you want to see, a nice crispy exterior with a creamy interior. The sauce it came with was good to dip in and paired well. Finally we ended the night with the 32 oz steak and a basque style cheesecake. The steak was perfectly cooked and the jus it came with was really nice. I liked how it had some lightly dressed veggies on the side which served as a good palette cleanser. The steaks crust was slightly too salty for my taste in some bites. The cheesecake was okay. It has a more rough texture than a new york style cheesecake. I thought it was something that people should try since it's a famous Basque dessert but I wouldn't try it again.\n\nThe service was acceptable here. They were really on top of the drinks. They were slow with my water and my coke zero refills. Overall, a really amazing place to try a variety of dishes. I think it's one of the better restaurants in Atlanta.",

The toast was really tasty as well!\nWe also ordered a lavender gin & tonic (which was huge for the price).\nFor dessert we got the basque cheesecake, and it was just as good as it looks.\n\nHighly recommend; better than a lot of the Spanish tapa spots we have at home in California!",

I also love the upscale rustic atmosphere. Very Spain.\n\nWe ended up just ordering from the Pintxos menu and splitting each dish four ways (which worked great!) We had so many that I cannot comment on them all but I will say that our favorites were the Bikini Grilled Cheese and Pork Cheek Croquetas. \n\nThough I don't drink, the beer and wine list was extensive. They also had some great cocktails. This is definitely a place to come spend a few hours to drink and eat (just as the Spanish intended).\n\nSpanish food is hard to find so this place is a hidden gem in Atlanta. Definitely give it a try. I want to go back to try everything I didn't eat.",

        "text": "I don't know how I missed writing a review for this spot. It's located in West Midtown. It's on the corner of 14th street and Howell Mill road. They offer valet parking located on the first level of the garage attached off of 14th street. \n\n My sister and I opted to dine here on a Friday evening. We came in without reservations. I would NOT recommend doing this. While we were able to be seated in the bar area, you may not have the same luck. \n\nOur server was awesome! He had a great personality. He advised us of his favorite items on the menu. I was already going to order 2 of his recommendations.  when I came on a prior occasion I had the Bikini and it was the  best grill cheese sandwich I have ever had in my entire life!  The other option I had already picked out was the smoked mushroom toast. His third suggestion was the Gambas, which is a shrimp dish. \n\nThe food came out in no time. Our first dish to arrive was the smoked mushroom toast ( my favorite  of the three dishes). The menu describes this dish as local mushrooms: black truffle, goat cheese crème fraiche, sourdough. The combination of all the flavors work. There is a slight taste of truffle that makes this dish special! It's a must try. \n\nMy  next favorite item was the bikini.  We did opt to get the vegetarian version of this dish.  The traditional bikini does have pork in it. The vegetarian bikini description is white cheddar grilled cheese, black truffle, white bread. A little history on the bikini sandwich: it's a Barcelona classic pressed ham and cheese sandwich. It is named after the Bikini hall in Barcelona. Ok, now that we know where the name came from let's discuss  how amazing the rendition from Cooks and Soldiers is.  This sandwich is simple perfection! I don't know if it's the butter perfectly toasted in the head or the quality of the cheese, but this sandwich will have you wanting more! \n\nWhile I also enjoyed the shrimp dish, it just does not compare to the first two I mentioned. However  it is a solid dish and worth ordering. \n\nOverall, this spot is one of my favorites in the city. It has a sexy ambiance with low lighting  throughout, amazing food and recommendable service is provided.  If you check it out, I can't imagine you being disappointed.",

Everything was good but there were some stand out favorites. I'll rank them in AHMAYZING and Good:\n\nAHMAYZING:\nPulpo a la Gallega: Octopus was delicious, cooked perfectly and really flavorful \n\nSmoked Mushroom Toast: Surprisingly, this was my favorite - and I don't even like mushrooms. The goat cheese creme was so smooth and the mushrooms were really flavorful\n\nPatatas Bravas: At first I was like, okay they are fried potatoes. BUT! They were so much more. The sauce was amazing and the texture was really delicious and unique. \n\nCordero Estofado: This is the lamb shoulder. It was cooked amazingly, just fell apart with your fork and the farro added some great texture. Also one of the larger plates \n\nGood: \nEscabeche de Atun: This is the bluefin tuna. It had good flavor, but wasn't super impressed\n\nSteak dish: I can't remember the name, but it was on the specials. It was a little chewy and just meh. \n\nMezcal drink: Also a good not great, nothing unique. \n\nA great experience and we had more dishes we loved then not. It is decently pricy, but figured that since it's tapas. I would go back to try even more!",

        "text": "We found out about this place through the Heritage Fire tour where they served the most incredible paella and generous servings of wine.   Even though paella isn't on their regular menu, what is on the menu is outstanding across the board.  Their pan con tomate with the ham add on is a must order every time I go there.  We really liked the pork cheek croquetas, and the Pollo Basquaise was amazing.  Since I'm not much of a dairy eater, there was a roasted carrot side dish that sounded great but I wasn't a fan of the sauce.  Our waiter suggested they could sub it out with a Romesco sauce and it was probably the best Romesco sauce I've tasted.  \n\nSince we're huge fans of Cooks & Soldiers, my wife and I never pass up an excuse to have happy hour there if we're anywhere remotely near the area.  The happy hour is pretty basic - $5 gin and tonics from a selection of 3 plus a $1 add on for a bite, but we'll always throw in an appetizer from the regular menu for one of the tastiest happy hours in town.",

Everything is cooked in a Spanish style. We loved the smoked entrees but thought it was used just a little too much. Although, the smoked mushrooms were fabulous. I liked the grilled octopus but I was the only one. Our waitress was knowledgeable and helped a lot in guiding as to how much to order. The rest of the group raved about the mountain bread, so don't miss that.",

She knows all about the food and drinks. The ambiance is very nice and the food was good! It's tapas so you will need to order multiple plates. It was two of us and we ordered about 10 items which was more than enough. I'll definitely be back!",

        "text": "Amazing! I really like the restaurant's vibe, food, and prices. I genuinely really like the staffs', well, genuineness. I don't at all like the fake snobby smiles and forced customer service just bc you have to.\n\nSince we went to Iberian Pig before (same owners), the hubs took me here for some pre-Valentines dinner. The atmosphere is different here, bathed in low light versus a dim, bar-like atmosphere with Iberian Pig.\n\nCana klasikoa: The charred goat cheese was presented with sprinkles of pistachio, roasted tomatoes and green pepper chunks with red onions on a slice of mountain bread. The slight smokiness of the cheese made this more interesting.\n\nMussel escabeche: The marinated mussels also sat upon a slice of mountain bread. These seemed almost to be chilled mussels with what appears to be crunchy water chestnuts (?). The fennel gave it a nice color with perhaps sobrassada being the base?\n\nBikini: What's in a name? A fancy grilled cheese: White cheddar grilled cheese, Spanish ham, black truffle on white bread. The gooey cheese and oil was oh so good, but since this came later in the meal, our faces couldn't handle the extra calories. Don't get me wrong, it was good!\n\nBasque montadito: This was a sandwich: chorizo, bayonne ham, green tomato tapenade with spiced chips. I think this was the least interesting choice as we couldn't figure out what it was at first. The chorizo isn't in the usual form we had imagined. Though it was good, it wasn't as interesting as the others -- just a normal looking sandwich with chips.\n\nPimiento relleno: Poblano, smoked mushroom on manchego cheese and romesco sauce. This was no doubt the hub's fav as he's into mushrooms. It's the most unique and interesting looking dish with unique flavors as well. It looked like two black things with smeared peanut butter, chocolate sauce, and peanut pieces if you were to describe it from a child's perspective. Lol.\n\nPulpo: Spanish octopus with roasted chestnuts, gigante bean on potato puree along with a 68 degree yolk, and I suppose the paprika pistou made it flavorful. The unique item choices really spiced up the octopus and made it even better. The potato puree and yolk were different and paired well together. Who would have thought.\n\nIberico smash burger: A pork and beef patty with manchego cheese, garlic aioli, guindilla pickles, and lettuce on an onion bun. Though it's a burger at the end of the day, the flavors and distinct ingredients made it stand out. This was filling if that's what you're going for despite being its size. As it was the last dish that came out, we couldn't finish the bread, but it was superb.\n\nI would definitely give this place another visit! I was quite impressed and pleased with everything, hence the five star review. And only places that give me those initial wowing moments get five stars from me. :)",

We never felt rushed, Derek recommended a great bottle of wine for us to gossip and chat over. The tapas were great! The croquettes were so delicious-got two orders. The tartare was divine and honestly had no complaints. Place was a bit moody which made it fun. Loved it. Will be going back.",

We tried some really cool items - Octopus and the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever tried that had ham and truffle oil in it. Yum!  The drinks were tasty and the wine was delicious and our entire group enjoyed our dinner!  Will definitely come back again for a date night soon!!",

We went the route of getting a larger main dish (filet mignon) to share, but I'd love to come back and try more tapas! I'd trust that anything on their menu is great. \n\nThey offer free valet parking in the garage next door.",

        "text": "Wow! What a fantastic dinner experience all around!\n\nI recommend making a reservation here, as I could see it filling up quickly (especially on a weekend night). Cooks & Soldiers has complimentary valet parking, which is always something that I greatly appreciate. Prepare to be wowed as soon as you walk inside the restaurant - the ambiance is beautiful and romantic, and both the bar area and the dining room are super aesthetically pleasing. \n\nOur waitress was Alex and she was an absolute gem - very personable and gave excellent recommendations. Expect to share tapas (vs. ordering an individual entrée) in order to get the most out of your experience. We split four dishes among the two of us, which doesn't sound like much but left us feeling PLENTY full. More specifically, we got the bikini (mini truffle grilled cheese sandwiches - so satisfying), duck confit egg rolls (one of their NYE specials, very tasty), Ibérico Albondigas (a meatball dish - good but not mind blowing), and the gambas (red shrimp served with sourdough - BEST dish of the ones we ordered). If I wasn't so full, I would've loved to try more, as I'm sure everything would have been delicious!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the cheesecake, which is not your typical cheesecake, but crust-less and much fluffier (almost like a Japanese cheesecake). Since we were there for a special occasion, they also brought us salted caramel ice cream on the house (with a candle) - such a sweet gesture! Both desserts were delectable. Highly recommend trying their desserts here, even if you're not a sweets person.\n\nAll in all, I very much enjoyed every aspect of my dinner at Cooks & Soldiers. Hope to come back soon!",
