You can purchase a wine bottle from the store and drink it at the table. \n\nMurphy's is a cute and quaint restaurant in the heart of The Virginia Highland neighborhood. It's a great place for a date or a birthday celebration. \n\nWe went on St. Patrick's day and they had St. Patrick's days theme menu items. I got the classic brisket ($26) and my partner got the Corned Beef ($24). Everything was delicious. \n\nWe got a cheesecake for dessert ($8). The service was great and we will definitely return.",

Dining out these days is a gamble with the service industry being what it is. Tonight was one of those gambles we lost. Waited over 20 min for drinks to arrive. Salads arrived about 30 min after that. Kale salad had a nice flavor but was underdressed. Beet salad, while attractive, tasted like canned beets. We ordered small plates. They were just average. Nothing special. We asked for more bread to go with one of the plates bc what was provided didn't even cover 1/2 of the dish. It came about 20 min later, at which point we declined & asked for the check. Water was never refilled & glasses sat empty. Server would walk by & never make eye contact. The manager did come out with our bill & to their credit, had comped 2 drinks- which was appreciated.  Such a disappointing meal & experience.",

Starters was calamari, artichokes, and smoke salmon flatbread, just heavenly.  Caesar salad, it was fresh crisp, croutons gave it an excellent crunch.  I could have eaten the croutons by themselves.  I order the Murphy's burger, well done, this was like no other, juicy, meaty, and try with the aioli dip, yum.  I'm not a French fry person, but those fries were great, little crisp to them.  I save the best for last, the key lime pie, holy moly!!!! It's chilled, creamy, dreamy, wonderful crust topped off with fruit, I literally die and went to heaven, every bite was the most amazing morsel you could every eat....If you go for nothing else please go for the pie! Mr. Murphy, thank you for such a wonderful experience.  - Selena w/Sanus",

It was great quality and tasted super fresh, but I don't think it is worth it at this price point. There are other great places in Atlanta serving the same menu more or less but at a significantly lower price. I suppose that the alcohol and cocktails are the highlight of the menu, but I ordered trail blazer and it honestly wasn't revolutionary. The service was alright during dinner but it's a bit slower during brunch. The mimosas during brunch were very good though! I only wish the brunch menu had a more classic breakfast. Definitely try and sit outside when the weather is nice because the vibes are great and it's just lovely to eat brunch at Murphy's in sunny Atlanta.",

        "text": "The sunnnnn! \nSaturday felt like my family's emergence from a cave. Based on Covid-19, we had refrained from eating out as much and hadn't eaten inside a restaurant in months. So we took a chance on Murphys and were impressed by the experience. \n\nIn terms of eating near or close to downtown Atlanta, it is my practice to make reservations. My go to is Open Table, it is an easy application and provides as much notification for your appointment as you wish. \n\nMurphys is very in tune with Open Table and even called to confirm our reservation the day of. As expected, Murphys was very busy during Brunch and at our 1pm arrival. Despite being busy, our reservation was honored and we were checked in and ushered to our table without incident. \n\n*Note: if you come with a stroller, you may need to store it up front depending on where you are seated. \n\nIn the restaurant, there was very good spacing between tables inside. The outside patio was a bit closer...so keep that in mind when planning a visit. \n\nIn terms of service, it was top notch. Our waiter, Ricky, was there when needed and super knowledgeable about the menu as to provide good recommendations. Although you really can't go wrong with anything at Murphys. Very good menu overall...especially Brunch. \n\nThe Air:\nMurphys runs a sanitized dining experience from the tables to the air conditioning. We felt well protected. \n\nParking:\nHighly recommended to utilize the complimentary Valet (tips are encouraged). You may find somewhere to park in the Highlands, but you risk the threat of being towed. \n\nReservations:\nMake one. You don't want to be waiting outside in pollen or rain. \n\nThe Choice:\nShrimp and Grits is great!\nThe pancakes and French toast are also filling and fluffy",

The dish was truly flavorful, filling and presented well. The chicken & tortillas were made together in a mash; that really made the dish phenomenal.\n\nTheir mimosas options seemed endless, which is a good thing.

Murphy's, without a doubt, was one of our very favorites. They have a lunch special of half sandwich, salad and soup. I am not a big food person, so this review is not because it was a lot of food for your money (though it was), but because every element was beyond delicious. The sandwich bread appeared to be homemade, the beef on the sandwich tasted like homemade pot roast, the salad was fresh and delicious with a deceptively simple salad dressing and the tortilla soup was chock full of chicken and flavor.  I left feeling pleasantly full, but not stuffed. Highly recommend the lunch special to get a variety of wonderful, tasty, fresh food.",

The restaurant is super cute, the staff wear masks, they're taking temperatures at the door and hand sani and masks are provided as well ( A+ Murphy's).\n\nWe ordered a couple of appetizers, Artichokes and a charcuterie board, which both were very good! I also ordered a blueberry mimosa, which was also tasty! The blueberries are fresh squeezed in house! \n\nFor my meal, I intended to order the pancakes but changed my mind at the last minute and ordered the shrimp and grits. I don't eat pork so I got it without the andouille sausage. It was just ok. The sauce was nice, the shrimp wasn't overcooked, but nothing to exciting about that dish. My friends ordered quiche's and mentioned they were tasty.\n\nOur waiter was very nice (although I didn't get his name). The ambiance of the restaurant, I absolutely loved and their staff was all wearing their masks properly! \n\nI would definitely return to Murphy's to try some of their other options!",

A steak knife wasn't brought until I asked so that slowed down my eating even further. But the steak was cooked correctly. My friend enjoyed her meal.

Masks by all staff and customers as they moved to and from tables.\n\nI'm not sure if the menus were one-time use, but there were no reusable condiments on the table. When requested, hot sauce came in a small dish. Very fancy, very COVID safe.\n\nA nice brunch menu, my friend chose the shrimp and cheddar grits. They looked great and she said they were delicious. I chose the \"Eggs Virginia Highland\" and it was also delicious. Spinach and mushrooms and nice poached eggs on a house-made foccacia served with a tomato hollandaise sauce and home fries. Yes, I fell off keto just a bit and ate some of the delicious fries. Look at the picture - how could I not?\n\nGreat service and a lovely restaurant that is chugging along in this new age. Definitely worth a weekend brunch!\n\n[Review 13550 overall, 869 of 2020.]",

I'm a foodie and I Love trying new restaurants.   I had the Eggs Slum Mulligan which is breakfast potatoes topped with bacon, eggs, and cheese.  I expected the flavor to be more robust.  There was no seasoning and hardly any bacon.  I will say that the muffins were good and so were the cocktails and the little cake they gave me to celebrate my birthday.   I don't think I will come back here for brunch though. The food just wasn't good enough and there are so many other restaurants in Atlanta for brunch I'd rather try.",

Second, valet parking is offered behind Murphy's at the Wells Fargo Bank. I want to say it's $2 if you have a reservation, but don't quote me for that price.\n\nNow to the good stuff! The patio ambience was amazing! I love that they had the fans blowing because y'all know how this Atlanta heat can be. They also had enough spacing for social distancing so that's always a plus as well. However, if you sit inside, they do have somewhat of a wine cellar if you will and an open kitchen. It was everything! Each food order (for brunch at least) comes with their delicious, melt in your mouth, homemade biscuits and a cornbread muffin. They also give you a variety of jams and butter to accompany. We opted for the Gran Mimosa, which consist of Grand Mariner and Orange juice and it's as good (and strong) as it sounds  I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict with the side of house potatoes and my fiancé ordered the Chilaquiles. Everything was DELICIOUS! \n\nThis is hands down one of our top places on our brunch list and I recommend you add it to yours as well!",

        "text": "Ok let's get into it! I came here after my friend suggested it. We made reservations (highly recommended) and it was located over in Virginia highlands area. But parking is valet and it was only $2 , which you can't beat in atl. \n\nInside - \nSuper cute ! It has a bar as soon as you walk in. Past the bar to the left was a wine cellar / room. You can taste and buy wine there. We sat outside this day and it's super cute. Little tables, a huge umbrella if needed. It was warm and perfect. \n\nDrink- \nI had the Apple ginger mimosa !! You could see some of the pieces of both at the bottom of the mimosa and it was perfectly blended and great for the season. I would drink a whole pitcher ! (Many flavors offered for mimosa so don't worry all can be accommodated). \n\nFood- \nThey start with biscuits, muffins, and bread assortment basket. The sides with it came with a strawberry jam, peach jam, and a cinnamon hinted whipped butter. All great or I was hungry. You know ya girl tried a few things. My main course was the chilaquiles !!! Baby if you are like me and love Mexican food. Look no further. I had my egg fried well as my only change but it was amazing and very filling. I had to try the breakfast potatoes which was almost a meal in itself. They are huge not Tiny ones I am used to. They were seasoned well and the size of one red potato half once! The pancakes were just for fun. But I ate it all it was soft and fluffy and buttery goodness. \n\nI think I'm going to go for dinner and do wine tasting ! Care to join.

        "text": "After a VERY disappointing round of Escape the Room (review coming...spoiler alert...not good), the smoking hot wife decided we needed to eat at Murphy's. Best decision of the day!!!\n\nThe location is immaculate, gentile, very clean, and looks like something that should be in New Orleans...only clean...and not in ATL. \n \nThe staff. Superb. Fresh plates and plenty of service the entire time we were there. My only gripe is the silverware had some kind of sticky funk on 3 of our knives. They were quickly replaced, but still...\n \nThe wife and I ordered the soup of the day (Chicken soup!!!!! Seriously...it was really good) and...being a good Texas boy I hate to admit this...the braised Brisket...which was amazing. The horseradish mashers and veggies that came with it were to die for. The Brisket was tender, plump, juicy, and utterly delicious. \n \nNow. One in our party ordered the Burger. Which was described as...and not kidding...\"This is an **Effing** good burger.\" Not sure if praise gets higher than that. But I will let that review stand on its own. \n \nThe cocktails and wine selection were great.\nSo. Great facility? Check. Great food? Check. Great Staff? Check. \n \nOnly the silverware...\n\nRock solid 4 stars.",

We made a reservation two weeks ago for outdoor seating only to arrive and be told they Only reserve inside tables - outside is always first come first serve.   Luckily I got there 20 mins before our reservation and the hostess was able to seat us outside without too much of a wait.\nReally yummy brunches & cocktails!\nGo for the executive mimosa if someone else is driving.\nMy poached eggs highland was delicious but very small amount of spinich and mushrooms.   \nIf you're not worried about carbs there are heavenly options - pancakes, French toast etc with all kinds of scrumptious toppings.

The food, drinks, appetizers for the three of us were great..truely.  server was great.  so what's the problem?  We arrived on time for our 830 pm dinner reservation on a Sunday night.  We did not drag dinner out, nor did our server.  When we asked about deserts we were told it was too late.  \"come back again and enjoy them\"  WHAT?  you can't cut a piece of cake?  I can sympathize that everybody wants to go home, but don't give us a late reservation if you can't serve us a complete meal.  To make matters worse, they now charge you 3% more if you use a credit card.  our meal was nearly 200.00.  Most folks use a card these days. Just leaves a bad taste in my mouth ( no pun intended). Maybe raise the prices on your menu and offer a cash discount instead.  I just think is squeezing a bit more out of the customer. I know they have credit card fees, but why not charge me a fee for utilities on a hot day?",

        "text": "Murphy's came highly recommended so we went for Saturday brunch.  We made reservations for 6 people the night before for early afternoon.  It was nice that valet parking was available directly across from the restaurant for $2.  We were late getting seated for our reservation but the staff kept us aware of the delay and were very nice about it.  Good customer service.  My food was good as well.  I ordered the pancakes with candied bacon (although I never got the candied bacon, chicken sausage is shown) and the Paloma.  Both were good, the pancakes especially.  My review drops to 3.5 stars due to our service once seated at the table.  There was so much confusion, wrong charges and errors with our order that it took away from the experience.  The largest being someone at the table being served pork after sharing they had a dietary restriction.  They were a quarter through their meal before this was brought to our attention and were then still charged for the swap of meat after the issue occurred.  Even after explaining things throughout dining, issues still remained.  It was to the point we didn't want to bring anything up anymore.  Sad to have had this experience after hearing all positive reviews, but the food we did enjoy was good.",

The food was hot, fresh and absolutely delicious. We even got some dessert to go. I can't wait to return to this area and eat at Murphy's again. Also it was easy to find parking which is always nice.

        "text": "Met a friend here for Friday lunch. My past visits have been to enjoy their brunch. Unfortunately, the valet wasn't open. So we had to find street parking in the residential neighborhood. It wasn't too bad and the walk was short. I suggest you make a reservation. It wasn't too busy to be a beautiful sunny day. We sat inside. Our waitress, Kaitlyn, was the best! She had great recommendations and had a very personalable spirit that was delightful. The burger & fries was good. The fries weren't too special. He enjoyed his salmon with sacatosh. We both got dessert to go (cheese cake and key lime pie). My cheese had a very light custard and graham cracker crust.",
