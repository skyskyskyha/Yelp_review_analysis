I've been going for years and it's definitely top tier.\n\nThe dedicated parking lot is a bit small but there's also paid street parking. \n\nReservations are recommended as they can be pretty busy and the location is quite small. \n\nThe charbroiled crab claws are to DIE for! So freaking delicious - I'm dreaming about when I can have them again. \n\nI wish I remembered the name of the frozen beverage I have but I recommend as it is super balanced and not overly sweet. I also had a fried catfish and shrimp basket - delicious! \n\nOverall 10/10 - no complaints whatsoever!",

The food was *chefs kiss* made perfectly, the space has that NOLA aesthetic, and the service was great! There were people here as groups, on dates, and I imagine it would even be a cool place to go sit at the bar alone.\n\nWe started off with some oysters to share which I enjoyed, they were mild but tasty. Then we had planned to split the catfish banh me and the shrimp banh me, we accidentally got 2 catfish banh me's, so one was complimented to us and we still got the shrimp banh me. We absolutely DEVOURED all three (hence why I don't have a proper picture of the catfish one). Trust me when I say the catfish was soft, delicate, seasoned to perfection, and the shrimp was crispy, very clearly fried fresh, also cooked to perfection. Everything was amazing, I hear the bar upstairs has some fun events but I couldn't find it on the website, regardless, I will be back!",

        "text": "My visit to Bon Ton was a letdown, marred by several significant issues despite some culinary highlights. The fried chicken Po'boy and the étouffée, brimming with crawfish, were the only saving graces of the meal.\n\n1) We were uncomfortably seated under a blasting air conditioner in the middle of winter, showing a lack of attention to temperature control. \n\n2) The mandatory 20% service charge was steep, considering the overall experience.\n\n3) The most frustrating aspect was the deceptive pricing. Menu prices at the restaurant were shockingly 20-50% higher than those listed online, a classic bait-and-switch tactic. Coupled this with a mandatory 20% tip and you're paying $30 for a sandwich. \n\n4) A particular disappointment was the charbroiled oysters. Served barely cooked, they were unappetizing, and my attempt to address this issue was poorly handled. The manager took the partially eaten dish back to the kitchen (questionably against health regulations) for further cooking and still charged us for it, despite implying the contrary.\n\nIn summary, while there are some palatable dishes, the overall experience is overshadowed by misleading practices and questionable service. If I ever reconsider visiting, it would only be for a takeout sandwich, and I would have to mentally steel myself for the insane prices and fees. Proceed with caution.",

        "text": "I found a hidden gem!  Well it was hidden to me and a lot of others knew about it because it got pretty full as we were in there.  I was looking for a place to celebrate a friend birthday dinner after work, that had good crab legs.  Bon Ton came up on my Yelp search and after reading reviews, made a reservation.  The building front is of pink color and they do have their own dedicated, free parking, which is such a plus in Atlanta.  Walked in and they had just opened and there was one other table occupied.  I was greeted and asked if I had a reservation, which I did and was late for, but she was so pleasant and said that's ok and sat me and then brought me water while I waited for the others to arrive.  Such a cute, eclectic environment inside that I was enjoying just looking around at everything from artwork to light fixtures.  It's not a large place, but it never felt overly crowded and there is available outside seating.  They have a full bar, but they do have some specialty cocktails on the menu and I ordered a smoked bourbon Mai tai, which was a great choice that one of my friends ordered it for her second drink after tasting mine. We ordered three appetizers to share for the table; charbroiled crab claws, charbroiled oysters, and hot sticky chicken.  All the appetizers were beyond delicious.  The flavors were amazing that I just knew the entrees were going to be fabulous!  For entree I ordered the smoked crab legs and everyone followed suite and ordered the same thing. lol!  I have never had a smoked crab leg, but I will definitely come back and have them again.  The only thing to make note, the broth in the bowl for the crab legs is super spicy, so if you add potato's and corn and they are soaking in that broth, you will definitely have your nose running from the spice.  You know when the flavor is so good that you disregard the spice and just keep eating! The server/hostess was awesome and super friendly and prompt to get to the table and refill waters and remove empty plates.  Such an enjoyable experience.  We went outside to get a photo after dinner and the owner happened to be coming in and he popped in a photo with us.  Such a great reflection of the overall feel of Bon Ton",

Living in New Orleans for over 10 years I thought this may be a nice touch. Truly it was a bowl of hot peanuts soaked in salt.\n\nThe crawfish mac and cheese seems to be what many patrons rave about. I will give it a 1/10. The 1 is for being piping hot when it came to the table. It's more or less velveeta shells and cheese with crawfish. Definitely not what I anticipated. \n\n The one item that made the experience work it was the shrimp burger. Delicious. Fresh ingredients, perfectly seasoned and paired with the right condiments. \n\nIn addition, cute little restaurant. Great ambiance and great selection of music.",

        "text": "Okay stop the food was so good here ??? My man and I came here for a night out, very chill, and low maintenance. The vibe in here is so cool, there's actually a speakeasy upstairs and we decided not to go. We did grab a drink at the bar. Standard grey goose martini with olives for me of course. Ms bartender did her thing! I like my martini with no ice chips so I appreciate the extra strain. \n\nI ordered the shrimp étouffe, it comes with two hush puppies, and the five spice broccoli which had a lot of flavor. I had no idea étouffée was this good, and unfortunately have nothing to compare it to, but it was rich and creamy without having milk, and the shrimp was well seasoned. The rice was not over cooked, which is worth mentioning in my opinion! The broccoli was yummy, and crisp but I could not finish it all on account of being full from my main dish. \n\nI'm excited to come here again for another date night or with the girls and maybe even try the speakeasy upstairs!",

        "text": "I had dinner here with a friend, and they chose the restaurant... my friend has good taste indeed! \n\nLocation and Parking \nBon Ton is located in Midtown near Mary Macs. There is a small free parking lot behind the building, but if you go on the weekend like I did, you might have to park one street away and walk over. \n\nVenue and Atmosphere \nThe restaurant is small, however it has two levels. The restaurant is on the main level and the bar is upstairs. The bar is bathed in red light with furry couches and a chill soundtrack. The main restaurant is bright with creole inspired decor. Restrooms are located both floors. Both levels were packed when we went on a Friday night. \n\nService \nService was prompt, courteous, and efficient. \n\nFood and Beverages \nI started with a half dozen oysters. The oysters were slightly salty but I fully dressed them as usual. I then ordered a crawfish étouffée entree. The dish was delicious and flavorful with the right amount of heat. The roux was also cooked perfectly. I sipped on a bourbon mai tai with my meal; it was strong yet sweet how I like it. \n\nVerdict \nI'll certainly be back during the week when there's less traffic lol.",

        "text": "Ok first of all, they said their crawfish is \"fresh\". As someone who lived in New Orleans, I can in fact confirm that this is false, unless by fresh, they mean fresh out of the freezer. Their crawfish is definitely frozen, and the meat is dry and shriveled and not good. I will say that the sauce they put it in is delicious, but $15/lb for frozen crawfish is robbery. It was also an extremely small portion, it couldn't have been more than .75 lbs. The shrimp is much better in their sauce. Shrimp is headless so a pound is a good amount for one person. Their boil sauce is a bit spicy, very good, and not overloaded in oil and garlic the way many Cajun/Asian boil places do it.\n\nOrdered corn and it was still cold lol so they use frozen corn too and didn't heat it all the way. When I say cold, I don't mean not warm, I mean actually like it could've been sitting in the refrigerator because it was chilled. I still ate the cold corn because the sauce tastes good, but jeez between the previously frozen crawfish and frozen corn, this cannot get higher than three stars.\n\nOur server was very nice but wasn't the most knowledgeable. Especially since she insisted the crawfish was \"fresh\". The atmosphere in the restaurant was sort of fun, a bit loud and music blasting. 20% service charge is included.\n\nDrinks were good. I got a sweet frozen drink and it was definitely very sweet but good.\n\nThe smoked snow crab was definitely interesting. It was $38 for 2.1 clusters. It was fine to split between two people, but the flavor overload was too much for one person to eat all the crab alone. With all the smoke plus Cajun seasoning and salt, it was great to try and a great dish to split amongst 2-3 people, but would've been overwhelming to eat more than one cluster.\n\nOverall, I might come here again for drinks, shrimp, and maybe try some of sides - if I feel like spending a lot of money for not-fine dining. But definitely avoid the crawfish.",

I finally agreed once we had an event in the area to go to and all the other restaurants on our list were already booked up... I will admit I was wrong putting my nose up to this place! It's decent quality seafood at good prices, a fun atmosphere, and friendly service. Their cocktails are good too and reasonably priced. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would return!",

Customer service is a job where you have to deal with people. These girls did not seem thrilled to wait on us or answer any questions we had about the menu. They were very short with us and had short patience. Not to mention, they charged us $2 for extra bread that came with our crab claws.",

No one asked if we were ok, if we wanted water, if we wanted apps, drinks, nothing. Everyone walked past our table multiple times with out so much as a hello. Even when making eye contact with waiters/waitresses, they actively ignored me. I waited 20 mins before speaking to a random staff person who walked by and asked him if anyone was going to give us service. \n\nThe food is lack luster at best. For a restaurant that boasts Cajun and Vietnamese fusion, you would expect each dish to be bursting with flavor. Every dish was poorly seasoned, my drink was watered down (especially given the price). I did not finish my food and there is a mandatory 20% gratuity, which is high given the poor service I received. The only upside to this restaurant is that there is a Krispy Kreme down the street. Save your money and time.",

I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars because my friend's crab cake was sub par in my opinion and service was just ok. I would come back specifically for that shrimp burger though. Seriously, order it!",

I had been dreaming about having the charbroiled crab claws, but was sadly disappointed when I was told by the waitress they were sold out. I had a reservation for Friday night at 8:15pm and thought since Friday evenings are busy that they'd have them. I ordered the Bon Ton Bahn Mi and the shrimp po'boy. The entrees were amazing, but sad about those crab claws still. I will probably try to come back during the week in hopes the appetizer is available.",

Our server Chris was good until we couldn't find him to pay our tab. But otherwise, service was good. \n\nBon Ton is a small, intimate spot with a scrumptious looking menu. My sister ordered the boiled peanuts and hush puppies as an appetizer and we got the smoked crab legs and potatoes as our entrees. \n\nThe peanuts are so good!  Spicy but still have a crunch to them. You can tell they're not sitting in water all day because the texture was not mushy at all. The hush puppies were basic to me and only tasted good if you dipped them in the accompanying sauce. \n\nThe crab legs are everything!  I don't know whose idea it was to smoke crab legs but I thank them!  They were cooked perfectly as the meat came right out the shell and the flavor was like a kiss from heaven.  The potatoes were good too but I didn't eat many since I was all into the crab legs. \n\nI also ordered the lemonade made Bon Ton style and I highly suggest you try it as well. \n\nIf you have time and are looking for something different, make a reservation for Bon Ton and enjoy!",

Mostly a fixed menu but a good variety so I feel I got a good flavor of the food. \nVery friendly and patient waitress (Mick). Poor lady had a lot to deal with but was so professional and pleasant. \nGreat variety of vegetarian/fish dishes for our family and meat dishes for the rest of the group. \nStarter salad had some awesome pickled veggies. I had the blackened catfish and the wife had the chickpea etouffee. My dish was very good but hers was outstanding.  Good depth of flavor with the right amount of heat for her. \n\nGreat vibe, great food, great service. Look forward to heading back and trying from the menu.",

The parking is limited and tight but not hard to find within their lot. \nCheck in at the table, and be mindful to stand inside as it's a bit tight. However, seating doesn't take super long.\n\nThe food is incredible, served hot and suuuuper tasty if you enjoy Cajun food. They know  seafood!! \n\nThe staff here is excellent. I have to say they know how to serve with style and grace. My bestie and I enjoyed Christmas drinks and picked at a few things:\nFried Oysters  \nHush puppies\nCrab  cake \n\nIt was pretty busy for a late-ish dinner. We got reservations for 9PM (strongly recommend) and it was such a great ambiance, from large groups, to small ones, to couples. Grab those peanuts! They are great for picking and compliment everything. Truly superb experience.",

All were extremely fresh but the snow crab had to be my favourite. We added the option to add corn (a great way to appreciate the boil seasonings) and potatoes (highly recommend!).  \n\nAll in all a delicious meal and quite affordable.

        "text": "OVERALL: Bon Ton is a really cool concept, but I think the details need refining. It seems like the quality is hit or miss depending on the night and what you order. I would give it another shot but am not rushing back.\n\nPARKING: Oh my god a nightmare. The lot fills up quickly, you cannot street park on side streets after 5PM (resident only), and you can't park at Mary Mac's. Your only option if you can't get in their lot is to park somewhere on the side of Ponce. We spent 20 mins trying to find parking. Plan accordingly! Or Uber!\n\nFOOD: I've sampled a lot, and here are my takes for each. \n- The crispy chicken is a must! So tasty, lots of herbs!\n- If you like them, the hush puppies are great as a side!\n- The papaya salad we ordered either came undressed as a mistake, or it was not good. There were very few, super finely chopped herbs (adding no flavor), no peanuts, and no evidence of sauce? We meant to ask the waitress, but didn't get a chance. \n- Meatballs are good but nothing special. The sauce that comes with is what would distinguish the dish from-- except it's too thin to grab the meat! We ended up pouring it over the papaya salad.\n- Buford hwy style oyster/catfish po boy we're both good, but absolutely not numbing spicy from the szechuan oil, or spicy at all. Again, the seafood itself was tasty, but not what I expected. \n- Cauliflower falafel banh mi was the only really veg-friendly item on the menu, and it contains nuts despite not being labeled... It also was lackluster. Ours came as just the patty, with very very few herbs, no jalapeños, etc. Nothing like a banh mi. \n- In the future, I would stick to a seafood boil or fried seafood here. \n\nDRINKS: All cocktails ordered were tasty! Lots of options, mostly classic cocktails with a spin of some sort.\n\nVIBE + SERVICE: Incredible. Everyone's friendly, the decor is trendy and has a sort of \"underground\" feel with the dark lighting against neon + tiki decor. Lots of outdoor seating and an upstairs bar as well (which we did not visit!)",

The employees were friendly and professional. \n\nFood prices were affordable for moderate portion sizes. I ordered a seafood boil with asian fusion style boiled peanuts as an appetizer. \n\nThe flavor was good but don't expect to experience New Orleans in a dish. Enjoyed it though! \n\nOverall, It's was a chill vibe. Great place to catch up with friends. Craft cocktails were delectable. I recommend.",

        "text": "One of my new favorite spots in town!\n\nI randomly came upon Bon Ton one day while scrolling through Yelp, and wow, what a great day that was! Being a lover of seafood and Cajun food, I was immediately drawn to Bon Tok. I couldn't believe that I had been missing out on such a gem since I moved to ATL, so I had to make my way there asap. \n\nMy first visit was a solo one. I love nothing more than enjoying a new place, country, restaurant or experience solo dolo. It allows me the opportunity to take my time and savor each moment without rush or a care. And I'm so glad that I did that! First thing to note: there's not a huge parking lot here. I'd *guess* that there's about 2 dozen or so spots right outside the restaurant. BUT - there are about a half dozen street parking spots close by and more up the street, and then some. So on a busy night, you may have a 2min walk - totally worth it!\n\nWhen you see Bon Ton, you won't miss it lol. It's bubblegum pink! It's like they knew I was coming. I'm just drawn to it! Upon entry, it's super dim and chill, with a busy kitchen to your right, a dimly lit staircase in front of you and a lively bar and dining room to your left. It's truly a gorgeous spot that had some love put into the decor, it feels like you're in someone's fabulous vintage living room lol. \n\nThe dining room is so aesthetically pleasing with its gorgeous highlighted art pieces and decor. Seating is limited, but I have no complaints there as it feels super intimate and keeps down on the noise for the most part. On all visits, I was seated quickly and given a great spot to enjoy all the corners of the lower level. Service is really great here! Better on a weekday/earlier evening, as when I visited on a Friday night our server was so lovely but seemed to be managing lots of tables. I do love that I saw multiple team members assisting in cleaning tables, bringing drinks out and more. I ordered a beer on my second visit that wasn't brought out when expected so after about 20min or so I asked another team member. It was brought out quickly after by that team member. Our server came back and explained that it was just a slip of the mind after needing to check on stock - and I really appreciated even hearing the transparency!! Sh*T happens, lol! I've been a bartender and waiter, And I asked for a random beer that may not be a regular choice lol. When it got to me, it was ice cold and they were so sweet to even remove it from my receipt. I would have been happy to pay for it and was really appreciative of the transparency and quick moves to pour it up once I asked. :)\n\nOnto the food. Bomb. The boiled peanuts are what initially brought me here lol. I love boiled peanuts, it's the country, south Floridian part of me lol so I had to try these! And their menu blew my mind because Cajun + Asian Fusion *+ Seafood all wrapped into one?! Yes please! The peanuts were SO good! (My second time around could have been better but it was late! You bet I'll be back for another back ASAP) I've ordered the gumbo twice now and WOW. Thick, flavorful, savory, delicious - just fire. The crawfish Mac & cheese? Fire, made with patience and love. The oysters are very good, but I don't think they will be my go-to after I've tried some really awesome oysters in town, but absolutely delicious choice. And the Po Boys?! PHEW. I tried the Nashville Hot Catfish and y'all. Please go get that baby (to go maybe because I need a seat to sit and watch my K-dramas while I mind my business - pls?)  and enjoy!! The catfish portion was heftyyyy, the bread was fresh, the veggies crisp, the hot sauce so spicy and yummy. \n\nA spicy, flavorful Cajun heaven. \n\nIf you see me at Bon Ton with my face in a bowl of gumbo and a fistful of boiled peanuts shells, please mind your business and just enjoy your delicious meal as I will definitely enjoy mine! :-P",

We were looking for a cute brunch place last minute and glad we found this spot, it was pretty easy to make a reservation, and I love that they have a free parking lot which can be rare downtown! The menu is expansive with vegan options, and even mocktails. Cajun Vietnamese is a cool combo concept and did not disappoint. We had the falafel banh mi, fries, crawfish etouffee and Mac and cheese. Definitely good and and not too pricey. Good portions and had plenty of leftovers. Our servers were sweet and had good recommendations and personality. Definitely will be back",

Also, the table behind us received their food before us and they came after us by half an hour. Our reservation was pointless. \n\nThe food was mediocre... I'd rather go to a restaurant where they specialize in Viet food or Cajun food. For the review that said the crawfish was frozen, agreed!!\n\nTip - ask for the wait time even if the kitchen's backed up or you may be at risk of the hangry/waiting game. \n\nStars are for the restaurant vibe and the other hostess/server who was very sweet. \n\nThis visit was unfortunately a miss for us.

        "text": "My husband had been wanting to come to this place for weeks for his birthday. We made it a pint to travel on a Sunday over an hour to make sure we made it happen. OMG what a mistake! We ordered our food (a catfish po-boy, a shrimp po-boy, 2 burgers, Bonton fries, and Mac and cheese. Listen it was overpriced and unflavorful. I wanted the crab fingers (which are a pretty frequent item all over their menu) they were out of crab fingers or any crab! I asked if I could get some fresh fries, I never received them! The waitress never said a thing! She came back to the table to let me know that the fries were removed. Absolutely they were because I never received them!? My son (who eats everything) barely touched his Mac n cheese. My kids enjoyed the burgers ($12 Jo the burger only) however it was so small. Really the size of a kids meal burger but on a standard menu. I don't know if we came on an off day or what but it was pretty empty and the food was lackluster! So they have an automatic tip of 20% no matter what size party you have. We asked if our tip could be removed and we provide our own gratuity based on our overall experience. Besides my husband wanted this for weeks and it was a let down! \n\nAfter we requested this the manager came over and debated with a horrible attitude. She proceeded to debate with us about why she would not remove the gratuity and making excuses for the poor overall experience and food! She stood over us and berated us for not telling her step by step on each item of food we did not like! All because we only asked that she remove the gratuity. We didn't ask for any food to be removed were were prepared to pay as agreed! We let her know we were unwilling to pay the gratuity. She then stormed off and said \"don't pay then\". \n\nThe hostess who was definitely more mild came over and we gave her the cash for the meal. Not sure if it was a bad day, bad manager, or what but the overall experience was terrible and one we will never forget as a family.",
