        "text": "Picture smelling what you're about to consume from two blocks away and just knowing that you're going to have an amazing meal.  Stepping into Fox Bros BBQ in Atlanta, GA, is like entering a haven for barbecue enthusiasts, and my recent dining experience was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I walked through the doors, the friendly and welcoming service set the tone for a delightful meal. The staff at Fox Bros BBQ exuded Southern hospitality, making sure that I felt welcomed right out of the gate. They also accommodated my desire to sit outdoors for this meal even though the other 100% of the diners at the time were all seated at the indoor dining room.  \n\nFirst important detail to note is that if I'm going to allow myself to indulge in a beer during a BBQ meal, it has to be the proper beer.  The fact that they carry Shiner Bock, a Texas classic, added an extra layer of authenticity to the dining experience. Sipping that cold Shiner while enjoying this meal created a perfect harmony of tastes that complemented each other exceptionally well. I'd have had another or two if I wasn't driving straight to Virginia after this lunch.  \n\nMoving on to the main attractions, the Fox Bros \"Burger\" is listed as the best burger in the Country on Yelp so I had to come find out why.  Imagine my surprise when I realize that this isn't even actually a burger at all.  Will you hear me complaining?  Absolutely not.  This is potentially the best brisket I've ever eaten, and it's definitely at least top 3.  Added to the brisket was perfectly seasoned and properly cooked bacon, tomatoes, onion, pickles, and jalapeno mayo on a brioche roll.  I could eat one of these weekly for the rest of my life and never get sick of it.  \n\nFor my side upgraded from the chips and got  the Fox-A-Roni. This was their Mac and Cheese mixed with their Brunswick Stew which further demonstrated the creativity and bold flavors that define this barbecue joint. The portion size was absolutely perfect and the creaminess of the mac and cheese blended incredibly well with the robust flavors of the Brunswick Stew.  I would love to try their other side dishes but I fear if I go alone that I will be forced by my desires to order this one again.  \n\nFox Bros BBQ is quite simply stated a fantastic BBQ spot in Atlanta. If you consider yourself a BBQ aficionado or you're just someone who is getting started into the world of BBQ, make this one of your stops.  I am guessing that the dedication to quality and a welcoming atmosphere will ensure that every visit to Fox Bros BBQ is a memorable and delicious adventure.  Fox Bros BBQ in Atlanta, GA - Didn't Suck!",

        "text": "Finally made it out to Fox Bros BBQ. According to my friend the parking lot is normally full but we were able to find a spot. Walking in approx 7:30pm no smell of smoke (no big deal) but I do look and smell. Upon entry they were packed inside. We were seated toward the back.\n\nWe had 3 in our party. 2 of us ordered the 2 meat combo (sliced fatty brisket and pork ribs). I ordered Collard Greens & BBQ Bean the other ordered Mac & Cheese and potato salad. He said his sides were ok not great. My third friend ordered a burger and side salad. His salad was huge for a side portion. I tried his burger and it was a mixture of hamburger and cubed brisket, bun was soft. A really good burger.\n\nMy combo had 1 slice of fatty brisket laying on top of sliced white bread, 3 bones of pork ribs both tasting fantastic just wished for maybe 1/2 of a slice more of brisket. I didn't like the collard greens had a weird flavor couldn't pin point it, they were sweet so I asked if there was sugar in them and she said no it was molasses  that flavor profile didn't work for me. My other side was baked beans and these were really sweet, couldn't finish them. I also ordered a side of jalape√±o corn bread, by itself it was ok, the sweet butter made it pop and was good. \n\nMy friend ordered the Banana Pudding, we all tasted. Missed with this as well, need more bananas or something.\n\nOverall you go to a BBQ place for the meat, and this place is good.",

It's disheartening because this place used to be one of my favorite spots to eat at while visiting the area. Despite the decline in food quality, I have to give credit where it's due: the service hasn't faltered, and the ambiance of the place remains unchanged.\n\nThat being said, I might give it one more try next time I'm in the area and hope for the best. I'm hoping I don't lose faith in this place altogether.\n\nOverall, while the food quality has been a letdown, the consistent service and ambiance make it a decent option for those looking for a familiar dining experience. Here's to hoping that my next visit will exceed expectations and restore my faith in this once-beloved spot.",

But since you have to do whole numbers, I'll round up since we had good service and I loved the Brussel sprouts. \n\nThe Brussels were 5 star worthy. Unique preparation and just super yummy. The corn bread had potential but was sadly too dry (needed butter to help it out). The smoked ribs were tasty, and the brisket chili was relatively flavorful but not something I'd crave or rush back for. \n\nOthers we were with tried various items from the menu. And enjoyed them to varying levels. My husband said the Brunswick stew was excellent and ribs were very good; but that the pulled pork was cold (which was disappointing).\n\nThe surroundings and decor was enjoyable and good for bigger groups, which is a plus. \n\nWouldn't rush back but would give it another try.",

All of the meats were well seasoned, tender, and juicy. Sides were also a hit! My personal favorite was the brisket chili - they don't skimp on the meat in there! You get brisket in every spoonful! They also have house made bbq sauces on the side that you can slater your bbq meats in - all of them v delicious. \n\nService / \nGreat amazing service.

It has a very casual, and southern ambiance to it. The service was immediately friendly and helpful. For the food we got the rack of ribs and the chopped brisket. Both of which were cooked to fall of the bone tenderness. We had a lot of sides with it all, cheesy mac, French fries, Brunswick stew, collard greens, and Jalape√±o corn bread. My family and I enjoyed all of it and will definitely be coming back!",

The place is always packed so street parking may be the only option.\n\nI had to wait 10 minutes to be seated but not big deal. I barely saw my waitress but the others were happy to fill my requests.\n\nThey have the option for indoor and outdoor seating. I chose indoor. \n\nI ordered the Fox Bros Burger with Frito Pie. They mistakenly gave me seasoned fries but brought me the Frito Pie for free. \"Happy Accidents\". The burger is really chopped brisked topped with pimento cheese and veggies. This burger/sandwich is delicious and I love trying the different sauces. The vinegar was not that good to me but the Sweet sauce and Spicy sauce elevated everything. Fries were crispy and seasoned well. The Frito pie is a bag of Frito chips with a scoop of chili and topped with a ton of shredded cheese.\n\nI will be back!",

The ribs were tender and had a nice smoke ring. The brisket was fattier than I like. The pulled pork wasn't burnt  it was just dry. The collard green had a nice kick to them. The macaroni and cheese, was cheesy but did not appear to be baked.\n\nSo should you go to Fox Bros BBQ? Go for the experience. The food is passable. The people are nice.",

        "text": "I've come here quite a few times over the years, but our visit not too long ago was the first in a couple of years. Parking has always been a little tricky. There are a few spaces right in front and then street parking on some of the nearby streets. On this particular night that we visited, we got a space right up front in their lot.\n\nWe walked in and were seated right away. It can get pretty loud inside when it's busy, but there were only a few guests sitting at a handful of tables scattered around the dining room when we arrived. The patio was totally full, though. It seemed like our waiter was one of only a couple working inside at the time, so it took her a while before she came to our table. She'd acknowledged us and let us know she'd be with us shortly. When she came to the table, she got our drink orders and that took a little more time than I would've anticipated as well because she had to tend to some other tables. But no biggie.\n\nWe both ordered the classic combo, which comes with your choice of two meats and two sides. Each of us chose the smoked quarter chicken and four wings but with different sides. I got the spicy green beans and fries. Husband ordered the mac & cheese and tater tots. We love the fried okra, but it's a seasonal item since it's only available in the summer. \n\nWe'd gotten there around 5:45 p.m., so most people were probably just heading out for dinner at that time. By the time our food came, the dining room had filled up pretty significantly. We'd had everything at some point or another in the past except for the green beans. Everything was good. I wanted a veggie and the green beans ended up tasting better than I'd expected. The chicken is always perfectly smoked, and they have a bunch of sauces on the table to choose from. All in all, Fox Bros is a staple in the city--consistent food and service. Check it out!",

My family of 4 were seated right away for lunch on a Wednesday. Parking was tight but we found a spot. Ambiance is typical BBQ casual. \n\nMy daughters shared some ribs and mac n cheese. They were very pleased. The ribs looked really good. My mom had a brisket sandwich and she gave it solid marks. \n\nI had the \"famous\" burger. It's not a traditional burger. It's basically a brisket sandwich with bacon, pimento cheese, tomato, pickle and onion...plus jalape√±o mayo. It was outstanding. Not the \"best\" burger in the country as claimed by some recent publications, but absolutely worth the trip and the price. I will go back soon for another.  \n\nService was solid, and the food was delivered super fast. Highly recommend this Fox Bros despite my inability to recommend the Brookhaven location.  I'll be back!",

The inside is pretty dimly lit but casual; the bar which was full service. \n\nThe banana pudding comes topped with graham cracker crumbs in a 6 oz lidless plastic container. It tasted alright but it's THICK and you'll probably need something to drink with it.\n\nOverall, not quite to the level of Texas bbq, but highly, highly recommend and is a must-try if you're ever in the Atlanta area",

        "text": "After a long day exploring Downtown Atlanta, we came to Fox Bros Bar-B-Q for dinner. At first, we only ordered an Everything Combo, which comes with 4 meats and 2 sides ($35). We tried the wings, spareribs, jalapeno cheddar sausage, and sliced angus beef brisket, with frito pie and jalapeno cornbread with honey butter as sides. The wings were coated in a smokey spicy hickory BBQ sauce, the ribs were quite tender, sausage was juicy, and the brisket had a good balance of meat and fat. The frito pie was basically frito chips, with ground meat, and cheddar cheese, which was good. The honey butter worked very well to moisten the cornbread and added a nice sweetness.\nWe ended up ordering another half rack of ribs ($22) and 12 wings ($24) because the combo was not enough to feed a party of 3. My friend had delicious BBQ before in Texas, so he said he had better, but overall, it tasted pretty good. \nThere is a small parking lot, but you can find street parking around the area.",

We had to forfeit and skip out. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations. However, we made it, and we ate more than enough for sure. They have CHILI this Way & That Way, I tell Yah Oooh, My! I ordered the Beef Brisket Chili, Bake Beans, and a Slab of Ribs. Ooooh, Yes, I did! AND Ate them ALL! EmHmm, That's Right! Frank had Chicken Quarter, Ribs, Sliced Brisket, Collard Greens, and Fries. All in all, we made 2 trips to Fox Brothers. Now we can definitely say we're hooked, and by God's Special Grace, we shall be back.\nOver & Out\nFranknKimm",

I had always wanted to eat here because I saw Fox Bros on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The food on TV looked delicious and thought if I am ever in the area this is a spot I will visit.  I was not disappointed! The BBQ ribs was phenomenal! I even tried the collard greens which I had never had in my life and they were so good! They reminded me of a leafy version of Brussels sprouts in taste.\n\nThe service was great! The staff was friendly and fast. The vibe is laid back so no need to get all dressy. There was plenty of parking when we showed up but we did show up before dinner time. The pricing was reasonable I felt but then again I am from CA and we pay more for everything here. \n\nYou won't be disappointed with this place! Just be careful!!!! If you come here, you will become a repeat offender quick!",

I'm told it's the best in the city and they did put up a very good brisket. \n\nA couple of notes about our experience...\nThe crinkle fries were nice and crispy. The coleslaw was good but a little watery. I thought the bbq sauce was ok but a little runny for my preference, and it tasted like it was missing a little something. I couldn't put my finger on it. Very tasty classic Mac and cheese. \n\nGood service. They had a good amount of outdoor seating but it isn't totally covered.",

The chicken fried ribs are a must try for everyone who comes here because they are delicious! The ribs were good. The chicken had that nice smoky flavor. The brisket got two thumbs up but no one seemed to care for the sides as they were rather bland and tasteless. Service was good even though the restaurant was packed.

It's no way that it's going to be the number one place in the country and me not dabble. \n\nThe establishment is dive bar decorated, a little dimly lit, but has indoor and outdoor seating if you wanted something brighter. The bar is a decent sized bar, it's whiskey heavy (if you are into that)\n\nI got in and sat at the bar. The bartender was mia for maybe like 5 minutes or so.. so I sat. But after she came around she was attentive enough.\n\nI tried the smoked wings (tossed) , the chicken fried ribs, the smoked cheeseburger and the Fox Bros Burger (of course...this is why I am here).\nThe wings were great, they did not miss.  The sauce was great, they were tender and flavorful as well as fall off the bone when you bite.  The ribs were well done. Fried to near perfection and just the right amount of tender and crunch. They came with a white BBQ sauce that was super solid and I would for sure do it again. The cheeseburger was really good too.  You can taste how well they smoked it.  But the Fox Bros burger... Was the star of the show. Tho it did need to have a little more sauce on it ... IT was still great and I would for sure spin the block on it!",

The Smoked Chicken Wings are outstanding -- crunchy and juicy with enough bark and smokiness to make you want to take another bite.  The brisket is lean and sassy with a bit of fat that just caramelized in your mouth with every bite.  The Cole Slaw was solid and on point, not too watery, not too vinegary -- just right.\n\nI will be back for sure!",

        "text": "Came here based on a recommendation. Since I had just moved, I arrived around 7:30 pm on a Saturday night to find them full with a waiting list of 20 minutes. We returned to check the queue 30 mins later after putting my contact information. Turns out their system acts up and doesn't notify people so make sure you stay close and touch base.\n\nFood came out in under 10 minutes by who I presumed to be one of the chefs with a smile on his face! My brother got classic combo plate of Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage and Pimento Cheese w/ brisket (lean) side of Spicy Stewed Green Beans, Collard Greens with an additional side of brisket chili ($5). I had their Classic combo plate w/ spare ribs and chicken with a side of Baked Beans and Cole Slaw (v). The proteins were flavorful and cooked perfectly with the rib and sausage being my favorite. For the sides, I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy collard greens and chili. A healthy serving of cole slaw can last you for a few meals. The chili was so flavorful I was able to use the leftovers to make a birria inspired ramen, so good!\n\nOverall, we had a great experience. I liked the customization of being able to pick lean vs fatty, dark vs light, and I'm sure there are other options too. Service was great from everybody working. Would recommend and come again!",

The sides actually outshone the pulled pork. \n\nThe pork was bad but it wasn't great either.

Owners are from Texas (Shiner Bock - Texas beer is on tap).  Briquet can be ordered lean or fatty - go fatty, oh so much better.  Smoked chicken wings make great appetizers.  As for side, cornbread, Mac & Cheese, everything is delicious.  Dessert?  Oh boy - more choices...great selection of beer (tap & can/bottles local & National brands). \nLocated on the edge between an industrial area and residential area, parking may get a bit tight.

It has gotten a lot of acknowledgment and awards from some of the top food creditors. Before I even experience the restaurant for myself, I seen it on the Food Network! You don't have to deal with much service seeing that you order your food at the front and you choose where you'd like to sit, but everyone still has a nice, warm smile, and are are ready to help you with any questions or concerns.\n\n Food\nI have a love for beef brisket, and may I say, theirs was cooked to perfection. The side completely complimented the BBQ, and I feel that the portions will make sure to leave complete! \n\n Price\nVery affordable and good barbecue!",

Yay!\n\nWe joined the waiting list and it took nearly no time, it did allow me to see how busy they are, with all pick ups, take away and in the restaurant.\nThe staff were very warm and welcoming and very efficient! (I like that, take care of business!)\n\nThe food: I went straight for the burger, husband got the combo option, with sliced brisket and pulled pork. We also got wings and ribs to go. NO REGRETS!\nBurger was different than \"normal\" burgers, it was AMAZING! \nThe combo was equal I delicious and flavored...\nThe wings and ribs... made us wonder why we hadn't had them yet and why we got so few...\n\nWe also got some nice GA tea (not for the kiddos... it is an adult bevie) and a margarita...\nClosing this feast with banana pudding was a great choice!\n\nRecommend getting your Fox Broa dose as many times as possible!",

I will say, service is pretty quick here so that helps with finding a spot. \n\nWe checked in and was told it was a 30 minute wait but maybe 5-15 minutes later, I was able to secure a parking spot and got my table. \n\nThe restaurant was crowded but we were able to enjoy patio seating for a party of 5. \n\nI ordered the combo plate with the ribs and the smoked wings.  The ribs were fall off the bone tender and I didn't even need the sauce. (Just a preference but trust me, flavor is packing) \n\nThe smoked wings were also delicious.  Most smoked wings are tough with a lot of pull if you understand what I mean by that.  These are, again, fall off the bone tender.  No sauce needed but I did dip in ranch, can't help myself :) \n\nMy sides were baked beans and potato salad.  Not the best but not the worst either. Do what you will with that information.\n\nOverall, they have earned my return visit. Go treat yourself.",

The bartender/sever Renna was the best! Quick and efficient. The host was gracious enough to split us up on to three tables. Our server started off friendly and turned into a pretty inpatient person quick. She was borderline rude. She mentioned the brisket was sold out. I asked her what meat was available and she mentioned what ever is on the menu. I get the fact that it was busy but customer service is key! She refused to split checks. We had a table full of teenagers. The co-owner did come over and made up for it with his conversation and politeness! Other than the rude and inpatient server our experience was great! The food is Texas style smoked bbq and lip smacking, finger licking good! We had the 4 meat plate with baked beans and potatoe salad. We also ordered a salad. The sweet tea was perfect tea and sweetness! We ended with a banana pudding and that was the perfect ending to dinner. Overall great experience and the food was outstanding!

        "text": "Delicious bbq, vibes and ambiance! I'm kicking myself because I wish I remembered our wonderful servers name. He was fantastic and made our first time here amazing. Super cool dude who walked us through the menu and even let us taste some of the fatty brisket, which blew my mind. My partner and I order the combination plate, which came with three meats and two sides a fantastic deal. We got the smoked chicken wings and brisket two ways chopped & sliced. We picked the smoked chicken salad & the green beans as sides. Everything was super flavorful and had a nice smokiness to it. Although we got the lean brisket for our meal, The fatty brisket was so good & I highly suggest. The meat is tender and marbled perfectly with the fat. We topped off our meal with a homemade banana pudding, and it was probably the best banana pudding I ever had. Will definitely be back here.",
