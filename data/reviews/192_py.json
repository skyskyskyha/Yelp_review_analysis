That doesn't make the food any less delicious, but the pricing could be slightly more reasonable. \n\nIt was pretty busy when I went and the service lagged a bit too. But again, the food was good enough to recommend and go back!",

                "text": "Wow what a find!  I really enjoyed my visit here.  I got the vegan breakfast sandwich and the vegan sausage balls.   My girlfriend got the waffle, chicken sausage and potatoes.   The potatoes were not great..she did not eat. I'm so glad I listened to the server.  I was going to get the vegan hash but she said the potatoes were different than their usual potatoes and people were not particularly fond of them.  My sandwich was delicious...I was confused about the sausage balls. I thought it was sausage stuffed beignets.  That was my bad for not reading.  It was still ok though.  The waffle was super good. I need gluten free but I still tried it.  I'm not sure if they have gluten free waffles but next time I may still get it. \n\nNow my only feedback is my girlfriend got the potatoes because the other choice was Johnny cake.  She didn't get johnnycake because who needs waffles and corn cakes.  Little did we know they are calling hash brown Johnny cake. The server was like yes people often assume it's pancake.  People are not assuming...that's what they are. Can you tell I really feel a way about this? \n\nThe place itself is beautiful though. Really nicely decorated.  Lots of seating. Can't wait until warm weather the outside seating on the side looks cozy.",

First off let me start off by saying I love the way this restaurant is laid out there are 2 different sides you can choose to sit from, and they are completely different the dichotomy of the restaurant is cool. I went on a Monday morning and it was pretty empty, just a few people that were working on laptops; which this is a solid work/study spot.\n\nI ordered the waffle BLT. The waffle and the bacon were both amazing. The only issue I found is that waffle doesn't make for a proper substitute for bread. The waffle was so crumbly so I made a giant mess lol. Next time I'll order the waffle and bacon separate. Also this place has some of the best I've ever had in my life. \n\nI'll definitely be back. You're welcome!",

They are a pretty decent size too. \n\nNice space and lots of people studying/working from there.

It's a little hard to get in and out of because Howell Mill has awful traffic, but at least there is a parking lot.\nWhen we arrived for breakfast, the line was out the door. I didn't have high expectations, but the line moved very efficiently and they even have someone stationed near the register to help you find a table, which is amazing.\nI loved my breakfast biscuit--it was just the right side and tasted great. Our coffees were also tasty. I'll definitely return.",

It is quite well decorated. There's plenty of seating and the tables are large enough to even whip out your laptop, which I saw several folks doing. And I love the whole order and pay from your phone situation. It's the efficiency for me. \n\nI ordered the oat milk cinnamon honey latte with an extra shot of espresso. It was too sweet for me, be the presentation was nice and the temperature was perfect. I'd give it an 8 out of 10. \n\nThe beignets were the biggest disappointment. I just knew I was going to get some fluffy New Orleans beignets. Absolutely not.  The flavor was there, but the texture was not. It was way too dense and not light and airy like an authentic beignet. I think the issue is that they made it gluten-free...I'd give it a 3 out of 10. I didn't even finish the one I bit into. But the two sauces they served it with were delicious. My friend actually liked them, she said they're good for \"vegan and gluten free\" and that I shouldn't expect an authentic taste lol\n\nThe vegan breakfast sandwich was actually super flavorful and I enjoyed the jam. From a culinary perspective, it needed some plants...like lettuce, avocado, or something to lighten it up. I'd give it an 8 out of 10. The vegan breakfast sausage was one of the best I've ever had. \n\nMy friend ordered the build your own breakfast bowl and she LOVED it and vowed to go back for it again tomorrow. She was impressed with every bite through and through. She's give it a 10 out of 10. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back but not for the latte and not for the beignets.",

Due to food allergies, I unfortunately have to eat dairy-free & gluten-free which is really hard to follow when eating out. I was so happy to not only find a restaurant with several GF/DF options, but with DELICIOUS options! Everything we ordered was incredible. GF/V breakfast sandwich (eggs and cheese tasted real!) with a pork sausage patty instead of vegan - so, so good. The GF sausage balls were to dieee for and so was the peach pepper jelly and blueberry compote on the side. He ordered the chicken biscuit with the pimento cheese and the Nashville hot sauce on the side. Best hot sauce I've ever had, I dipped everything in it. The potato Johnny cakes were also amazing. The sriracha bacon was good, but probably won't order next time (flimsy even though we asked for extra crispy and just 2 pieces, but good flavor!) Loved the atmosphere, coffee was great, and our waiter was super sweet!",

Noteworthy was the turmeric golden milk, a refreshing and amazing beverage that complemented the meal perfectly.\n\nThe attentiveness of both the bar and service staff contributed to the overall positive ambiance. Whether patrons were engrossed in work or leisurely enjoying their day, the atmosphere proved accommodating for both pursuits.\n\nWith plans to explore the entire menu on subsequent visits, including the extensive cocktail selection, the prospect of returning is met with anticipation. The establishment's commitment to culinary excellence and a diverse menu, coupled with attentive service and great ambiance, makes it a definite go-to for future dining endeavors. They also offer military discounts!",

It's a beautiful atmosphere and very friendly staff. \n\nFrom the drink menu, I've had both the Lavender Matcha Green Latte and the Golden Latte. Their signature drinks are some of the most unique I've found, on par with East Pole Coffee Co...\n\nFrom the food options, I've tried the Bacon Pimento Cheese Waffle and the Cultivate Chicken Biscuit (which I believe is what is pictured). \n\nNext time I will have to try the shrimp & grits, I tend to order that at every brunch place I visit to compare.",

You can also pay through the app which means you can leave whenever you want.\nThe space is nice, airy, and clean with amazing food. I highly recommend this place (maybe during the week so you aren't waiting a long time). \nAlso the servers are so nice!!

The location is off of a busy street and it could be easy to miss if you don't know which side of the street to look for it on.\n\nParking\nThere is a small parking lot with free spaces. If that's full, there is a parking garage just across the back street.\n\nSeating\nPLENTY of seating. Where you are looking for solo to mid size group seating, you can find a spot. They have both indoor and outdoor seating that ranges from booths to standalone tables and high top to low top tables.\n\nMenu\nGreat size menu that accomodates all good choices. If you're vegan or gluten free there really is something for everyone here. \n\nFood\nI chose the build your own breakfast sandwich (bacon and egg on croissant bread). My sandwich was great and I really loved the croissant bread they offered. Ordering was annoying. They only offer a digital menu and you order and pay via your phone. Personally, I don't like this restaurant trend. I had questions about the menu but didn't have anyone to ask. \n\nService\nWalking in I was immediately greeted which is always appreciated. Once we ordered, servers brought out our food and that was the last we saw of them. I would've liked a water or condiment for my sandwich but again, no one to ask for either of those things. No one even came over to make sure our food came out as preferred.\n\nWhen you order your food, you receive a text notifying you that you've begun a tab, and another text reminding you to check out/close your tab. I was meeting a colleague and really wanted to focus on the conversation and spend time away from my phone. I don't like that this restaurant really makes the patron depend on their phone for the entire experience. My only reason for giving 4 stars, instead of 5, is the phone dependency.",

They even forgot my husbands order altogether and we had to ask for the second order to be made, which took another 35-45 min (so we shared mine while waiting for his). \n\nIt seems like people know it too, because it's not nearly as crowded as it used to be.

It was very bright and clean and had several other people working on laptops. I loved that you order from your phone directly at the table so anytime while you are working you can just order or order something else! \n\n***STAFF***\nThe staff was super friendly and brought out everything so quickly! \n\n***FOOD/DRINKS***\nSo good! I just had an iced dirty chaga and it was 10/10! Also had grits with normal cheddar and they were so yum! \n\nThey have Soo many vegan and gluten free choices! I love that! I also love that you can sub the vegan options for non vegan. The grits were listed as vegan but you can choose your cheese so I opted for dairy cheddar :) everything is very customizable though which is great for all diets! \n\n***PRICE***\nPretty normal for a nicer cafe in Atl! My drink was 8.50 I believe so slightly on the more expensive end but it was reasonable for what it was. It had espresso and milk like any latte but also a superfood powder etc. So I think the price was okay. It was also soo good! The grits were 5$ which is really not much and they were very filling! \n\n***CONCLUSION***\nDefinitely will be back here soon!!",

So, like many times prior, I got a chance to try a restaurant that had been on my list of venues to visit for some time now, thanks to my best friend. And, thankfully, Cultivate did NOT disappoint. \n\nI had the strawberries and cream cheese waffles with a side of biscuit, and two espresso martinis - which, for a typically non-coffee drinker like myself were OUTSTANDINGLY delicious!! The price point was great. Everything was fresh and prepared in a timely manner. The staff was amazing and the overall aesthetic and atmosphere of the establishment was really good. \n\nOverall, I would go back time and time over and recommend to anybody looking for a great brunch / breakfast spot.",

It wasn't too crowded when we got there, but by the time we left at 11, people were waiting for tables. \nThe food took a while to arrive, but it was quite tasty. My friend got a matcha latte. I just got black coffee. She loved the matcha latte! For food, we got the brunch sandwich and the eggs Benedict. I got the sandwich and got it as a biscuit with eggs, bacon and cheese. It also came with a little (very little) side of jam. My friends eggs Benedict was interesting. It was served on a biscuit. The biscuits were pretty good. They are big. I wish they gave more jam. Overall pretty good. They have a big menu with lots of vegetarian and vegan options as well.",

However, their service says other wise because they made sure to check up on us to see if we needed anything and made sure we had a great experience! \n\nThe coffee their was delicious and loved the idea of building your own through their website or link from their QR code. I was able to either check out or open a tab if I was staying there for a good amount of time. It was great!

Not a bummer but I did try their cold drinks. I ordered the Salmon Hash as pictured. It was really good, the food came out hot and the cream cheese on top was an amazing add. The portion of the food was great, (i took some to go) I had a Lemonade 8oz with Delta 8 in it. (You can taste it) but it was still good and drinkable. \nThe service is a new kind of service that i am starting to see now. You walk in, you can sit anywhere. Each table has a virtual menu for you to scan. With the virtual scan it allows you to place your order online and add a card at the same time to be convenient. Once placed my order the waiter came to bring it out in no time and once finished, you can get up n go since your check was already covered! Brilliant!",

With my pilates studio not being too far, stumbling upon Cultivate via Yelp has been one of my fave new remote working opportunities. \n\nUpon arrival, parking in the public garage just steps away was such a breeze. When I walked in, I just felt totally refreshed by the bright and open interiors. With large windows that are almost ceiling to floor, and their colorfully tiled floors, I just fell in love at first sight. I grabbed a table in the corner and got cozy quickly. I hadn't been paying attention to the availability of electrical outlets but lucky me, as soon as I turned around in my seat, boom! An outlet :) (With a super cute, cheeky sign lol) \n\nWith QR codes displayed on the tables guiding guests to their caffeinated cravings, ordering was a breeze. I actually love the option of ordering via an app from my table, especially when I'm working as I may be sitting there for 4 hours and going through numerous drinks and snacks. I ended up going with a few Salted Caramel Lattes on my first visit paired with a BYO Vegan Grit Bowl.  DELICIOUS. All of it. They were brought out fresh by the awesome Cultivate team and I was excited to see them coming with each new order. I almost stayed long enough to close my laptop and enjoy some cocktails, but decided to save that for another day. \n\nIf you're looking for a new coffee shop, a spot for smoothies, or delicious place for lunch and more - Cultivate is worth a try!",

My mom got that dish but I plan to come back and get that myself and then to try the salmon dish one day too. I also got a hot drink made iced but forgot the name of it and it was really good. I'll have to come back and do a review again for the name of the drink. This place is definitely worth going to. \nPark in the parking garage if you can and dining is mainly self serve. The ambiance is a very chill one which is nice.",

                "text": "I've been here twice. There's a small parking lot, some parallel parking spaces and a deck available, but one time all were completely full so we had to wait for sometime to leave  Both times, seating was a challenge. You'll wait in line to order, both times there were maybe 10-15 folk ahead of us and the area for the line is pretty small and adjacent to the entry so it gets tight. After you order, you're hustling to find a seat, like any seat. I don't love the feeling of ordering to eat in and not knowing that you'll be able to sit somewhere to eat -akin to a fast food setup.\n\nThe first time the food was good. I ordered salmon hash both times. They offer a very light, healthy menu with vegan/vegetarian options. The first time, the salmon hash was lovely. The second time they bought it without capers and with no sauce. Either they mixed up my order or the kitchen was too hurried and my server didn't notice. When I bought it to her attention, instead of taking my plate to correct it, she merely bought a cup of capers and a cup of sauce. Ultimately it did not taste as well as the first time. A great segway to the service. Most of the servers appear under 30 and are generally nonchalant in spirit. Some are friendly or pretend to be. Others don't try much. Expect truly marginal service here. Maybe it's because folk may not tip since you have to order and seat yourself. No clue but my second visit was damaged enough that I'll skip this place in the future. The food was not good enough to suffer poor service.",

The bowl was great although the French toast was hard and not sweet. Coffee was nice, vanilla latte was not the best. It's more of a self serve (drink refill, napkins, utensils) which for some is ideal, especially for me since I like to have enough napkins, but you tip when you initially ordered and I suppose the service was not there especially considering you help yourself to majority of the tasks. Our bill came out to $65 with tax. For the quality and the amount, I don't think it's worth it.",

I love a good sweet/salty combo and the side of blueberry compote that came with it meshed wonderfully with the sandwich! My friend ordered a cultivate-a-sandwhich with a bagel, bacon, and eggs. She said it was quite good. We also ordered coffee- the highlight of the meal! The blue nectar latte was my favorite! Definitely not your typical coffee, but it tasted great and looks stunning!

The check was about $50 for two.\n\nYou stand in line to order your food and bring a number to your table for them to bring the food to. Kind of like Jason's Deli. Tables are first come first serve. \n\nPros:\nGreat ambiance! Seating inside and outside. Very chill, comfy, and relaxing. This is a great alternative to the loud and crowded brunch venues we have in downtown Atlanta.\n\nI had the shrimp and grits. () The Cajun sauce was not too spicy and the shrimp were fresh.\n\nCons: \nThe place itself is a little hard to find. There isn't a huge sign you can see from the street but there is one on the building. It is not very big and the writing is in black.\n\nWould I Recommend: Yes, anyday.\n\nFollow me @jessreviewss on Instagram for more",

Everything was hot and fresh. The beignets and waffles are super dense and was more like a cake donut, than light and fluffy. \nAmbiance was great. It's a cool brunch spot or day date. Would be back to try alternatives from the menu. \nBest items are definitely their drink selection. The lemonades and teas are delicious.",

                "text": "Cultivate is the perfect place to grab brunch and coffee with friends, family, or solo; lots of menu items for different diets. When they first opened a few years ago they had traditional waitress service and I believe you also had the option to make a reservation. Well things are much different; on a busy Sunday I had to wait in a very long line to place an order, then I received a number. Seriously, this placed was packed on a Sunday around 11am, fortunately my sister and I were able to find a table for two. Once your items are ready a server brings them to your table, which is why you're provided a number.\n\u00a0\nOn this visit in mid-February, I dined with my sister. We shared an order of vegan sausage balls ($15), vegan beignets ($12), and mimosa bucket ($30). I ordered a vegan brunch sandwich for my entr\u00e9e ($18). I also had an oat milk lavender latte which was close to $7\n\u00a0\nWe both enjoyed our meal and had a really good time. It took a very long time for our food to come out to us, so this is not the spot to come to if you're short on time; we gave ourselves two hours for dining at the restaurants, however that still wasn't' enough time due to the long food wait. I'm sure they probably were short staffed, and I know the food is made to order but it still was longer than expected. It would be nice if you're given an estimate of when your food will arrive to the table after you pay. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nVegan Sausage Balls - think meatballs! You get about 5 and it's served with peach pepper jelly and blueberry compote.\nBeignets - are gluten free and vegan so don't expect NOLA style. You get about 6 served with maple syrup and a seasonal dipping sauce.\nVegan sandwich - very filling, I was only able to eat half. It's a vegan patty, chao cheese, and vegan egg inside of vegan bread.\nMimosa bucket - serves four people and you get three different juices to go with your champagne.\n\u00a0\nThere is a small lot with a few parking spaces, then there is garage parking. The day I visited it was completely full, so I went to the overflow parking lot next to McDonalds.\n\u00a0\nOverall enjoyed my meal and would return, my preference would be on a weekday over a weekend to avoid the crowds.",

I woke up this New Year's Day wanting coffee and brunch. \n\nBefore I begin, let me first say that this restaurant is very nice, clean and modern with an artistic, yet sophisticated feel.  The food presentation is amazing and the atmosphere seemed warm and inviting.  HOWEVER, despite the ambiance, and the extremely well prepared presentation of the food, the management (Kylie) displayed a VERY DIFFERENT experience than what I hoped!\n\nMy first experience was one that involved me feeling embarrassment, humiliation and disgust. My encounter was beyond disbelief with the manager of the establishment named Kylie. Kylie was offensive, prejudicial and lacked professional judgment. I'm not sure if her lack of professional judgment was the result of her inexperience as a manager, or if it was the result of prejudice, racism, and deep rooted anger, or maybe lack of self-esteem and attention in her personal life. \n\nWhatever caused her publicly inappropriate comments to \nme, it was certainly enough to make me question if I would ever come back into this establishment again.",

There's limited parking right up against the building and then a shared parking deck further down. You stand in line to order. They have traditional menus and QR codes. Once you place your order at the register, you seat yourself.\n\nThey have high tops, bench seating and traditional tables.  There's plenty of seating and the atmosphere was very chill. I liked it. The drinks were super yummy. We ordered the turmeric latte and the honey latte. The food on the other hand left much to be desired.  The food came out fairly quickly. We got the salmon hash and the nashville hot chicken and waffle.  The salmon hash was ok but the dish overall lacked seasoning. The hot chicken and waffle was a major miss. The \"hot chicken\" sauce tasted more like general tso's chicken and the waffle was meh. As someone who lives part time in Nashville, I definitely would not call that \"Nashville Hot.\"  For this to be my first time here, the food did not deliver.",

There was a pretty long line but lots of seating available and the line went pretty quick. \n\nThe Goat Cheese Croquettes were my favorite! Awesome crust filled with goat cheese. It also come with dipping sauces that are seasonal. One was super sweet, the other kind of spicy so it was a nice mix. The Cultivate Benedict wasn't on the QR code menu for some reason but it's on the main menu. The biscuits were super flaky, but the pork belly was a tad dry. Overall, still an interesting dish, but not the best bennys I've ever had. My husband got the French Toast. I wasn't a fan of the multigrain toast, but ricotta added some good flavor. I also was not a fan of the Lavender Matcha Latte, but my husband loved it. It was wayyyyy to sweet for me, and you taste much more lavender than you do matcha. \n\nOverall, a great experience. There was outdoor and indoor seating. Seems to be a cool date spot or place to have a friend's brunch. I'd go back to try some of the other stuff on the menu (fried chicken looked delicious) and get the Croquettes again!",

The potatoes were really crispy and well seasoned but my favorite had to be the Cajun sauce that complimented the bowl really well. The goat cheese croquettes were also good but I wish they had more flavor or that the jams had other flavors to cut the richness of the goat cheese. The coffee options were also great both the cappuccinos and the iced coffees too. Overall, I really liked the experience and will be back to try the other options available!",
