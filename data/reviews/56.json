The French toast was okay. Personally the southern style egg rolls coulda stayed. I shoulda got their earlier to order my food but it's okay. The whole party must be there to be seated/ordered. My friend ordered for me. While I wasn't disappointed I wasn't that much impressed (with the food at least) vibes and service was fosho worth it. Will be back .",

The service is always pleasant and accommodating, even during their busiest hours. The food is great as well. I brought a family member who is incredibly particular about their meals and even she raves about this place! That's a win for sure. Just be mindful that there is a wait most times when coming here, however they typically turn over tables quicker than their expected wait times. Seating at the bar is always an option as well. Definitely check out this place and bring your friends and family next time they visit Atlanta.",

The bad attitudes, unwelcoming first impressions and bad communication is becoming an epidemic at our Black owned Atlanta restaurants. \nDo better Doc & Pancho - very bad reflection of your brand.

I tell you that it is worth every penny ! We enjoyed a bottle of champagne breakfast in a private room and top notch service! On this trip I opted for the steak and eggs and instead of potatoes I got grits. This meal was super delicious and fulfilling everything on my plate was cooked to perfection!! I am dreaming about this right now. Our server was super sweet and kind loved her!

        "text": "I give this restaurant 1 star, first there was a long line OUTSIDE, in November no inside waiting area! Then by the time my boyfriend and I got to the front of the line we went inside only to be told by the security to go back outside and wait for the host to come and seat us, which took her forever!!! After getting inside we enjoyed the decor and the full bathroom mirrors, we waited for our server which took the young lady 30 minutes to come and get us water for the table, when we were finally able to order the server only sent back my boyfriends food which took mine even longer to come out, nothing special about the food the only thing that was a 10/10 was the grits, the steak and lamb chops were grey, and unappealing the gravy on the lamb chops were thick and chunky with no taste. We were irritated we spent that much time in line and also at the table without food just to get something we both thought wasn't worth it! Sadly it's just the name, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're used to seasoning on your food, or great service! But if you want to say you ate at Breakfast at Barney's go ahead! Feel free to skim through my reviews I go to some pretty good eating joints so I KNOW what good food is, this isn't it! Enjoy",

        "text": "I had eagerly looked forward to dining at Breakfast At Barneys. The restaurant seems to have a cult following so I wanted to experience it for myself.\nIt was a very frigid day in Atlanta on the morning of my visit, so my dining guest and I wore coats. I didn't see any coat racks so I asked our server if we could place our coats on a chair at an empty bar. She said \"NO!\" I asked the bartender and he said \"YES!\" I assured him I'd move the coats if the seat was needed.\n\nFor the food....\nMy friend ordered the Fried Catfish & Spicy Spaghetti and I had the Emperors Breakfast. The food came out after a reasonable amount of time, and presented nicely. The Fried Catfish & Spicy Spaghetti looked amazing! My Emperors Breakfast looked very appetizing but upon a closer glance I DISCOVERED HAIR ON MY TOAST AND PLATE. I informed our server and she promptly returned the meal to the kitchen to be remade (I hope it was).\nThe cheesy grits were great and the turkey bacon was very good too.\nMy friend enjoyed their meal also. The spaghetti was very spicy but tasty. \n\nWhen we left, there was a line forming outside on this unusually cold Atlanta day. I left with mixed emotions about my experience with the hair, and how our server offered only a \"NO\" about where to place our coats instead of directing me to a coat rack if there was one.\nI'm not likely to return to Breakfast at Barneys given FINDING HAIR on my food and plate.",

        "text": "my experience @ Breakfast at Barney's was very disappointing to say the least.\n\nLet's start off by saying, I was really looking forward to experiencing their brunch. You can always expect a long wait @ Breakfast at Barney's so make sure you are not starving prior to your arrival. Bring a light snack with you if possible because wait times vary.\n\nOkay now to review the restaurant, first of all .... after the long wait to be seated, me & my friend waited almost 30 minutes before anyone in the restaurant greeted us. Many servers walked past, NOTHING ...  Eventually, we took matters into our own hands & we flagged server down to ask for waters.\n\nAlready completely turned off by the restaurant, my friend didn't even want to order any appetizers or drinks & stated let's just grab some quick food and leave. We had already waited a combined 2 hours and we were just starving at that point.\n\nOnce our food arrived, it was mediocre at best.\n\nThe omelette was terrible, and the New Orleans Blackened Mahi was even WORSE!\n\nDon't know if I'll ever come back to Breakfast at Barney's again to give them another try! \n\nThey missed in every aspect of Dining! \n\nHighly disappointed :(",

The plush green and blue furniture is very inviting.  We were quickly greeted and seated.  All of the food was delicious!!! There is also a private room for events. The only flaw was the ladies rest room.  Although beautifully and tastefully decorated, there are only 2 stalls with very little waiting area.  Even though it was not very busy while there, the line did back up.  Everything else was enough to not make this a deterrent to come back.  I will definitely be back!!!!",

The fried chicken was so good and the waffles were a perfect mix of savory and sweet with the sage infusion + apple cider bourbon syrup. I thought the French toast was good too, but definitely overshadowed by the yard bird.\n\nGiven how good the savory items were, I'd definitely come back and try their standard breakfast items. Barney's is a kinda fancy, but totally worth the money and wait!",

I'm so glad my breakfast companion stressed that to me so I made a plans to go. Early. Baby I said EARLY, I fought my desire for sleep and made my way. I loved the mural near the parking garage and walked right in. My friend was enjoying a fresh juice flight at the bar and I could tell the place was about to get real busy. It was a weekday. The space is bright with small adornments to make it very inviting to me. We ordered the soul food egg rolls for the table. It was warm and delicious with just a touch of heat. Lush greens and macaroni wrapped for a perfect appetizer. I don't know what it is about breakfast but I want pancakes or french toast. I chose French toast with whipped butter and\nfruit. I'm not sure if they purchased the chicken sausage or made in house. I loved it. The staff was pleasant and helpful. I enjoyed gazing out the window.\nThe balance of the checkerboard floor tiles and complimenting with wall art. \nI will definitely go back to enjoy another meal.",

As a result of being super popular this place doesn't accept reservations and is super busy from open to close. Nonetheless this spot is cozy, casual and the playlist is on point for the vibes!\n\nLet's get into the food - Despite having a full house the food came out fairly quick and everything tasted well cooked and had a lot of flavor. We started with the soul rolls, (highly recommend) which was a perfect combination of sweet and savory, followed by Chicken and Waffles(Yard Bird) and Docs Chicken Philly which were both cooked to perfection. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend Breakfast at Barney's for anyone looking for a truly memorable dining experience. The food and the vibes are top-notch, and I can't wait to come back and try more dishes. If you're a foodie, tourist or just looking for a great meal, It's definitely worth the wait!",

The hostess and a young brother in uniform were very friendly. The waitress I observed and the one who got my (burnt) $6 coffee were dry, curt. \nThe food was delicious: lamb chops cooked medium as they should be, without asking and exact medium over eggs with very creamy, perfectly seasoned grits.  Five stars to the chef. And some people say it's pricey, but it's downtown-ish Atlanta and the quality matches the price--except for the coffee. \n\nI couldn't figure out how to pay for an extra side side salad from ordering online. Additionally, it took a couple of tries for the system to work.  After reading other Yelp reviews, I would say weekend visits are smarter with a reservation; and I didn't notice if the parking lot is free or validated, but the Barney's experience is worth a visit for sure.",

The service I received at the bar was on point, they anticipated everything and I wasn't lacking or in need of anything. I love the juice that's made in house and food wise I ordered the salmon croquettes with creamy cheese grits- mouth watering and delicious! \n\nThere's usually a long wait here so be ready for that, and the valet costs 5$ even if you park and the wait is too long so you leave you'll still have to pay- keep that in mind. \n\nAll in all I love it here, every time I go I order the same thing because I think it's put together perfectly. This is a great vibesy spot for you and your friends to drink and have a good time with great food. Sometimes I order my food to go because it's so crowded but they haven't missed yet.",

        "text": "First time dining at Barney's today with two girlfriends. We had plans for an event and this was on our way there. TikTok and Yelp rate this place pretty high but it wasn't that great to me. The taste and quality of the food warranted 4.5 stars but the poor service dragged this place down.\nUpon arrival there's a fully armored police or security officer at the door at 9:30 AM. I get that this is in-town and crime may be an issue but a doorman in a suit with a vest beneath his clothes would be more welcoming. It reads night club.\nThe hostesses failed. Just straight up set the tone for a poor experience and that's their job. The first thing they said is - hello, is your entire party here? (they were at the valet) then you'll have to wait. Okay. I took a seat at bar to order a drink or water - I was told to stand by the door and wait. Hmmm. Shortly after my friends arrived they quickly say it's card only. Okay, sure. Something else was mumbled on the walk to the table but it's hard to know when someone is talking with their back to you.\n\nWe skipped drinks and appetizers - straight to entrees to get out of there. \nThe food was delicious. The pictures don't do it justice. Kiss the chef! \nWe weren't asked to have anything else, just how to prep the check. It got pretty busy so it took a while to even close out the check. At the door on the way out - no farewell greeting, how was it or come back again. Never saw a Manager walking around either.\n\nThere's really something happening in the service industry that's been lost. Keeping customers happy. It's like patrons are doing the restaurateur a favor. Service and customer service needs to be paid way more attention for me to return. Probably just Doordash it to avoid the nonsense.",

        "text": "Breakfast at Barney is an absolute must! \nI normally would not visit a restaurant that has a lot of hype because usually all it is HYPE! But inn this case I was pleasantly surprise the food is FIREEE.\n\nThe food is to die for, literally. \nI have yet to try anything that I didn't enjoy and if you have read my reviews you will know that I am the flavor queen and if you lack I will let it be known. The cuisine is brunch with a southern flare and as southern girl fill me up! The fish and grits, the mac and greens, the French toast and spaghetti YUMMMM! I'm actually hungry just thinking about it. The 24k pancakes is enough to literally feed a family. \n\nThe service is pretty decent I have no real complaints but that's always my expectation if you're already automatically charging me 15-20% in gratitude. The food is usually delivered while still hot and you don't have to wait long for a drink.\n\nAlso, you can visit this location and avoid the weekends PLEASE do I beg of you or you will have a wait that's so ridiculous that'll make you change your mind about dining here. And being that they have no brunch specials for the weekend I 10/10 recommend going during the week if possible.\n\nBy the way this is not your standard brunch place, you have to worry about anyone twerk on your pancakes, the vibe is super chill and the music is really grown and sexy. But its still a vibe, the interior of the restaurant is super dope as well definitely insta-worthy.\n\nThe mimosas are pretty expensive so I suggest having your pocket on full if you plan to come here and leave with a brunch buzz. Unfortunately, they have ZERO specials for brunch and if you try to just purchase a bottle thinking that's the cheaper route you are absolutely wrong. They will attempt to charge you 150+ for a bottle you can get from the store for about $10-15.  \n\nAlso, the parking is pretty awful. I highly recommend parking around the corner on the street for free, it'll be a great way to walk off all that food you're going to enjoy. Or simply valet, but the line for valet is always a little back. \n\nDespite all the extra that comes with the place is sooooo very worth the price and the wait.",

We planned to take to go plates and there was so much food leftover we had a whole second meal. Several mimosa options as well as the option to buy a bottle and have different juices so you can add a much (or little lol) as you want to your mimosa.

        "text": "The food was horrible. Everything was pre cooked hours before. The chicken was fried earlier then when I ordered it they re dropped it in the grease. The lamb chops were boiled then gravy was threw on them. The eggs were dried out. The potatoes were dried out. The soul food egg rolls were cooked hours before then warmed back up when we ordered them. The only thing that was good was the fried green tomatoes and the margaritas. I was highly disappointed. They don't accept any form of cash. You can't change things on the menu. You have to order the food the way it comes. You can send any food back. If it comes out messed up you still have to pay for me. Our meal was $222.44. I will never go back. Plus the chef kept bringing our food to the table and her clothes were so filthy.",

We ordered the 24 Karat Gold pancakes, soul rolls, lobster Mac and Greens, chicken and waffles, million dollar margarita. Everything was delicious and delectable all around. The food was fresh, tasty and well prepared.\n\nWe had an amazing experience and will visit again when in Atlanta.",

        "text": "Since they do not accept reservations, it's walk-in only. I went there on a Sunday afternoon with my friends and there were people waiting outside. We were told that it would be about a 90 minute wait. At this time, the host added us to the waitlist and we were number 30 on that list.\nWe left and then came back when we saw that we were number 6 on the list. At the time we arrived, we got the text that our table was ready and had only 5 minutes for the table to be held.\nMy friends decided to go on while I figured out the parking.\n\nWhen I got to the parking garage around 3.30pm, there was no space so I proceeded to the valet. I was told that valet was closed so it was self-parking. I attempted to park in one of the open valet spaces and was told not to park there, the space was valet only. I was irritated at this point because the valet is closed and the parking was just sitting there\nAt this time my friends called me that they were not allowed in because the whole party wasn't there. Mind you, one of them was with a toddler in the cold!\nShe asked the security if she could at least step into the entrance because of the cold for the sake of the child but was refused.\nAnyway, I eventually found parking as someone was leaving the garage.\nThe ambiance was nice and the place was full.\nThe food took a while but it was not bad\n\nLambchops\nThey tasted okay but was chewy and over cooked even though we asked for it to be medium\n\nEmperor's breakfast\nThe eggs had no single seasoning. Sausage was good and potatoes were just ok.\n\nSpicy spaghetti\nThe star here was the fried catfish. It was really tasty and well fried. They delivered on the spiciness of the spaghetti. \n\nOur server was attentive and nice too.\n\nI might order the catfish for takeout there but I won't be back to dine in. No place is worth a 90 minute wait.",

I went on an earlyyy Friday morning because I'd been warned about Atlanta's busy food scene. It took a couple of minutes to get greeted but we were seated right away afterwards. There were fresh flowers on each table which is an adorable detail that really stood out to me. \n\nThey renamed their staff as Experience Specialists, which was super honorable as well. Tai was assigned to our table and did a wonderful job. She was very kind and efficient. \n\nTheir menu had a great variety of options. As an educator, I do have to say I spotted a couple of typos that should have warranted a reprint. \n\nFood was SPECTACULAR. I mean REALLY good. I loved it. 10/10. They earned my trust for sure and have every right to refuse those meal modifications because it's great as is!\n\nThe bathroom hallways had really inspiring photos highlighting black folks of high achievement. I thought that was really cool and had the potential to make their target audience feel seen. Bathroom appeared to not quite be serviced from the day before. It was appealing for the most part anyhow.\n\nWould for SURE go back in a heartbeat. More than happy that we made this our first stop in the ATL. Great job Brunch at Barney's . Lovely experience .",

They have valet parking for $5, plus tip. They don't have bacon, but they have bacon alternatives.\n\nWe each got a meal and we split another entree. We definitely didn't need to split another entire meal. Here's what we got:\n- Yard Bird ($18.50): The chicken and waffles both had really good flavor!\n- Emperors Breakfast ($15.50): Your average breakfast. We got it with chicken sausage and it was good.\n- The Breakfast Sandwich ($14.50): This was the best dish out of all 4 meals. The sauce on the sandwich was good!\n- Barneys French Toast ($15.50): This was the dish we all split. It was decent, but definitely not a must-order.\n\nWe didn't get any drinks, but boozy brunch is definitely the thing to do here!\n\nI'm glad I tried Breakfast at Barneys once!",

I will be contacting the Georgia Department of Health. \n\n\nCustomer service is deplorable here. \nI ordered shrimp and grits - they were CLEARLY undercooked, translucent and rubbery. I brought it to the attention of our waitress who went to the kitchen, came back and told me \"the chef said it's cooked\" but I'll get the manager. Another waitress then comes over to repeat \"the chef said the shrimp is cooked\". I then cut the shrimp for her to look at it - she makes a face and says \" ooo yea I see what you're saying\". Then the \"food and beverage manager\" who said her name was Emily - came over and told me \"the shrimp is cooked\" without event looking at the food. She was rude, condescending and told me \"I'm telling you it's cooked\". Then her remedy for the undercooked shrimp was for me to pay 50% of the meal and pay for a new entree. See attached photo of the undercooked shrimp. Do not patron this establishment is you care about not getting food poisoning or customer service.",

        "text": "I found this place since this is Yelp top rating.  But i have to agree most other yelpers l.  This is really a nice place to got for brunch. \n\nWe got there by Friday around 10am. We had a little wait like 30 min.  The service was pretty good. We had shrimp and grits and spaghetti. Shrimp and grit was great and I never saw spaghetti in brunch menu but it turned out a very good dish. \n\nThe ginger shot is really something else. It's great but it's a bit too strong for us. \n\nI will recommend to come here when you are in Atlanta.",
