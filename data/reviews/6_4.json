The interior is so well decorated and all patrons match the energy, the atmosphere is all really well done. Definitely a photo worthy place. The service was great as well all friendly staff and smiles from start to finish. Enjoyed the bartender he was very attentive, patient and offered help at every chance. However, the food, beautifully presented, is lacking to be very honest - I deducted a star for that reason alone. I went for brunch but if you're going for just drinks at the bar this is a beautiful pick!",

        "text": "TL/DR - Really awesome atmosphere, medium service, superb drinks, overrated and quite frankly disappointing food. Great for your instagram, go elsewhere for quality food. \n\nThe atmosphere and picture friendly vibe is real. Drinks are great. A lovely complementary treat to celebrate our anniversary was awesome. But our server had no idea what was on the menu, and said, word for word when we ordered the cheese selection, \"I have no idea about any of these but I'm sure they're all good.\" She was quick to serve and VERY polite, but servers not grasping their own menu is the kind of B- service you expect at a brunch chain, not ATLs most up and coming spot. \n\nThe incredible drinks came out quick and blew us away, but our food was an absolute monumental let down.  An ordered to medium steak and eggs, served well done, sent back to the kitchen for the first time in my life, then returned VERY well done AGAIN - coupled with canned lobster meat on a hotdog bun and calling it a $38 lobster roll cannot outperform the former, and may make for a great insta photo or impressive first date spot, but not a solid upscale brunch location. \n\nThe prices are high, the vibe is absolutely there, but the food is far from what you're paying for. If you want a knock your socks off brunch - this is not the spot. If you want an insta photo to make your friends jealous, and are down to pay a premium for  a B- meal to impress your date or feel immersed in something awesome, this may be the spot. \n\nIf you chase good food for your dollar and want a high class brunch experience, this is not it. Atlanta can deliver so much more.",

        "text": "I'd been wanting to come for such a long time!! My friends and I finally got a reservation for a birthday celebration but fyi it can take a while. I recommend checking OpenTable a month before the day you want to dine and reserve immediately. Slots are released 31 days in advance.\n\nOnce we arrived, we were seated quickly and it's definitely clear that they have put a lot of care into their decorations and aesthetic. The restaurant is a lot smaller than you'd think (which explains limited reservations) but it really did feel like you were sitting in a garden. Our server was very helpful and didn't mind us taking pictures and taking it all in. \n\nMenu-wise, I know we were paying for the experience, but the food was really pricey for very small plates. I'd recommend either eating before/after and just getting drinks and some snacks or know that you will need to order a lot of small plates. We ordered Gnocchi, Lobster Roll, Skinny Fries, Thousand Layer Potatoes and Chicken Royal. Everything was super tasty, but the skinny fries and thousand layer potatoes were definitely our favorite! (The skinny fries was a pretty large serving and definitely filled us up). We also had a couple drinks Inc the Send Noods, Pony Express, and Bend and Snap. The Send Noods was super fruity and delicious and came with a cute rubber ducky photo op, and the Pony Express was an excellent espresso martini. \n\nOverall, it was a nice experience and would definitely recommend if you've never been, but for future special occasions, I think there are other places I'd pick, as they'll take less effort to reserve and have better food choices.",

Terrence the general manager, Carissa the hostess and especially Armani our server were all delightful. \n\nThe space is gorgeous, the food spectacular ( my daughter said it easily rivaled anything she has had in NYC ) and the service out of this world. If I had a private event to hold ( and I may one day) this would be the spot for at least one event. My daughter lived in Atlanta after graduating and while we lived just South of the city at the time, we never made it here.\n\nI have plenty of Atlanta favorites and this is right there with them!",

At 10pm, there's a \"show\" to transition the restaurant from a dim setting to a much darker (but super vibe-y) setting. Food was all unique but tasty. The menu is tapas / shareable style. Drinks were a little pricy for what you get but we're cute. A little too sweet for my liking but that's just me. Overall a must-hit restaurant in Atlanta. Super cool.

The bar was not first come first but now it is. On Friday and Saturday nights around 9pm you may find a live singer but usually a DJ. They like to mix it up but that's what I like about it. The menu has been updated a bit too. The spare ribs are incredible if you are a pork eater. If not, try the salad. The bar staff has been pretty consistent and the ambiance is everything. The staff may turn the lights off start clapping and shouting and blowing bubbles. I am a bit annoyed that they are apart of a restaurant group in which you can sign up for and accumulate points for every dollar you spend. Not one person has told me that and I have spent hundreds of dollars at this establishment. That is very annoying.",

If you need the restroom, you actually need to go into the hotel. Technically you could park across the street in the shopping plaza.\n\nIf you want a table highly recommend that you make a reservation. Usually it's a few weeks out. But if you want, you can try your luck for the bar which is first come first serve.\n\nThe ambiance is very nice, super pretty looking but would say it feels more like a place to go with girlfriends rather than a date night. \n\nYou access the menu by scanning the QR code. Enough items to choose from but not overwhelming.\n\nSend Noods: the drink with the cute ducky...okay let me say it tasted like fruit juice BUT by the end of the drink I could feel the alcohol slightly. Just didn't taste it.\n\nHot Mess: slightly sour with a hint of spiciness...wasn't my type but my husband did enjoy it.\n\nOysters: first impression was why are these oysters so small...BUT it tasted really fresh. Especially paired with the onion sauce (?) and Tabasco it tasted amazing. Usually I only have 1 oyster because I don't really eat raw food...but I actually ate 3! Highly recommend.\n\nMiso glazed ribs: would skip...too salty. The meat was tender enough but overall meh. And since we asked for no cilantro...it was literally just meat. Not even a leafy green for presentation.\n\nLobster roll: one order comes with 2 rolls. They look small but very filling. One bite and it was already kinda too much. We actually put a bit of the onion sauce and Tabasco and the flavor profile was much better and to our liking.\n\nThe forbidden fruit: presentation amazing...taste was a flop. I think it was cream cheese inside? I don't know but did not taste good at all. \n\nOverall it was a nice experience. Was a bit disappointed that the flowers weren't real at all. Would only go back if someone else wanted to.",

Be prepared to spend at least $100 per person. The drinks were average. Nice balance with a decent amount of alcohol content. The staff claim that some food items are shareable but nothing could be further from the truth. The lobster roll was tiny. The wagyu must've been domestic. Cucumber salad was an oxymoron as it's literally a sliced cucumber with sauce. I enjoyed the oysters & the live singer the most. I'm slightly interested in brunch but doubt this is the best bar in Atlanta albeit being the most beautiful one.",

The room is beautiful, food is amazing, and service was great. \n\nThere is a younger male host who was SO kind to me and told me happy birthday and was so friendly with great energy. \n\nOverall the food was amazing. Yes the portions are small so expect to order 2-3 things per person and enjoy the variety and experience. We ordered two things of the miso glazed pork ribs because they were THAT good. Our next favorite was the pappardelle - amazing!\n\nThe only even slight disappointment is that you're paying for an experience (and a pretty pricy one at that) and they don't give you anything for your birthday or really make your birthday special at all. After such an expensive meal, a small dessert feels like it would be a nice touch.",

        "text": "I finally got to dine at the Garden Room! I have seen this place all over social media for years and I consider it one of those places in Atlanta that you must visit. Call it a bucket list item if you must. I mean it has an iconic ambiance of flowers (both real & fake) from floor to ceiling in the entire restaurant. The first thing you see when you walk in is a huge blooming tree and lots of natural lighting for beautiful pictures. Luckily, I went with a friend that had already been before, so she prepped me on the pros and cons of the restaurant prior to our visit. First off, this place is known for being very difficult to secure a reservation. You can reserve a table on the Opentable App up to a month in advance. Tables book up quickly too, because the restarant is very small in size. Parking is Valet at the front of the St. Regis hotel. Be sure to get your ticket validated by the hostess and it will cost you about $12 plus tip. I have heard from multiple people that the food is less than impressive and you will leave hungry with your wallet empty, so my friend and I ate dinner before and came here for drinks only. I do not regret that decision. Looking at the food that was being served next to us, the portion sizes were microscopic and the prices were some of the highest I have seen in a while. The drinks I had were tasty and pretty, but not as instagramable as I had hoped. I ordered the \"Send Noods\" drink and they were out of the rubber duckies that are typically served with this drink. I mean, when I told someone I was going to the Garden Room, the first thing they said was get the rubber duckie drink!  So this was a huge bummer! Next, I tried the \"Bend and Snap\" drink, because I was intrigued by the Rose foam. It was good, but the Send Noods was still my favorite. I ended the night with the \"Pony Express,\" which was the Garden Room's take on an espresso martini with peanut butter flavors added to it! I loved how it was served with a Reeses cup as a garnish; however, my friend ordered one too and her's did not have that. I also had to ask for espresso beans to be added to the top, which I thought was odd, since I have never had an espresso martini without those. Overall, the service was just okay and the way the drinks were prepared and served seemed inconsistent. Each drink was $20 and once you add tax and tip it can get pretty pricey for drinks, but I considered this one of those special occasion bucket list items that I was able to officially check off!",

We had a 7:45 reservation, but were seated immediately when we arrived at 7:25ish.\n\nI've seen this place allllll over Instagram, and see why it is so hyped up. It *is* as gorgeous as it appears! The decor is stunning and would be a perfect date night spot! \n\nFood and beverage wise, everything we had was delicious but not sure if it was worth the price. However, I think if you come to a bar like this (especially since it is in the St. Regis Hotel) you have to adjust your expectations and know, yeah, you're probably going to pay a lot because of the setting. We had the miso pork glazed ribs, 1,000 layer potatoes, and the tater tots. To me, the tater tots were oddly enough the star of the show (and only $12!!). The drinks were gorgeous and tasty as well. I knew going into it that it would be pricey, and genuinely had fun taking pictures, drinking and enjoying the overall vibe. \n\nI probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but it definitely is something to check off your bucket list if you're super girly and enjoy these types of bars. Cute vibe for a girls night or a date! \n\nAlso the restroom is in the St. Regis and super lovely and fun to use...and there's a doorman!",

Definitely make a reservation far in advance if you want a table or you can try your luck at the bar. \n\nLuckily I got a spot at the bar and was able to enjoy some drinks and a light snack. We had dinner prior to coming but wanted some French fries which were absolutely delicious. \n\nNext time I come I'll definitely have dinner here. The menu looks amazing! \n\nSuch a beautiful well decorated inside with plants and chandeliers. Definitely an instagramable restaurant!!",

Normally I drink water w/my food then resort back to my cocktail but, when I say I could sit it down. It was so so so beyond awesome that I even ordered a second.) \n* Service is very hospitable (Let Mike serve you at the bar)\n* That Wagyu Burger was honestly, the best giant-slider burger I have ever had. It was beyond delicious & I've been craving another since last Sunday!!!!\nCons: \n* Making a reservation \n*Wait time for food for me was about 30+ mins\n*NO ADDITIONAL CONS\n\nWith all the above being laid out...I have one question? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\nPut your phone down, hurry...log off the computer & get to going!!! \nThis place is by far a must to try! #Seriously!!",

My recent dining experience at the Garden Room in Atlanta I found to be a five star experience top to bottom. From the moment of check in, the \"ground\"was set for an enjoyable evening with no prior expectations. One of the managers working this particular evening, Jen, was extremely accommodating in meeting my request for seating in spite of the fact the restaurant was extremely busy, nonetheless Jen quickly made available my desire for preferred seating. I found the wine list to be extensive with options as well as sample tastings provided for my enjoyment. \nMy server was extremely pleasant with a full review and explanation of menu choices. I found the meal presentation and serving sizes to be appropriately presented and extremely tasty. The for mentioned manager personally checked in on several occasions to make sure my dining experience was enjoyable and all of my needs were met. Upon my departure she encouraged me to return and at some point  experience their Michelin awarded adjoining Atlas restaurant. It was such a pleasure to enjoy an exquisite dining experience in an atmosphere of fun and professionalism. I would in no way be hesitant to recommend The Garden Room to those desirous of an exquisite dining experience.",

        "text": "A lot of reviews say this place is overrated, but I would definitely not agree. I was initially super skeptical of this place since it's extremely difficult to get reservations and is expensive. \n\nI went for Mother's Day brunch (which had a minimum deposit of $150 per person ). Of course that had initially given me a bad impression, but once we went, I was genuinely surprised. The ambiance and decor is beautiful. It's not that big, so I can see why it's hard to get a reservation. We went in with the thought of meeting the deposit in the amount of food we ordered. \n\nWe started off with two drinks and they are strong! All of the ones I've tried taste really good and you barely taste alcohol. Then, we ordered the crispy lavash. The dips that come with it are great but my favorite is the salmon one. My mom ordered the lobster omelette which was also delicious according to her. I had the steak and eggs. The potatoes with it were so crispy and unique. The steak was perfectly cooked and the egg was runny :). A surprise they had at the end for Mother's Day was a room full of desserts so we grabbed one of everything. We also got a coffee and an order of chicken and waffles too. Everything tasted great and made the expensive price worth it. \n\nThey had a live singer and a dj during the brunch and my mom was in awe of how great the singer was. They really made a great experience. \n\nParking here can be confusing but they have a valet which ends up being $2 or $3 after validating w the restaurant.",

Cocktails were spot on--I had the Send Noods cocktail with edible glitter and a rose petal garnish and my date had the Lychee martini. Both were absolutely delicious and strong. The DJ was awesome and consistently played my favorite songs. I was in heaven! We had the Le fraise dessert with terracotta flower pot and filling made out of chocolate and a delicious sorbet shaped like a strawberry. Wow! One of the most creative desserts I've ever had. The only downside is the reservation system being booked out months in advance, but luckily we came late and got a table without reservations.",

        "text": "I made a reservation a month in advance to see what the exclusivity hype was all about. While I was excited to try this restaurant, please read below for the full scoop:\n\nLocation: Next to St Regis. \n\nParking: will need to do valet parking next to the St Regis and The Garden Room will validate your valet parking and its $2. \n\nExterior: Use the stairs to get to the restaurant or risk getting trapped in the elevator!\n\nInterior: BEAUTIFUL! It's like eating in a beautiful floral garden. Very feminine restaurant. \n\nVibe: Definitely not a date night place, more like a night out with your girls. The food portions alone will not fill up your Mae partner and in fact, will quite aggravate him lol\n\nDrink: I had the send Noods drink and while it was cute, it wasn't all that. But it's a good photo op. \n\nFood: (THE IMPORTANT PART OF MY REVIEW) Ordered off the Dinner menu: I had the pork ribs and the flavor was very greasy tasting and bland and made me feel nauseous afterwards. The truffle fries were tasty but I would've opt for a veggie side than potato side. The menu is very small and extremely limited and the portions are for toddlers, as my 10 yr old would've wanted 2nds. The vibe feels very feminine and is not a date night place at all. \n\nService: was great, my server/bartender disappeared for awhile and another bartender happily assisted me. \n\nWill I go back? I wouldn't break my neck or legs running back but I will definitely not be returning on my own.",

This restaurant is definitely an Instagrammable moment. They serve small plates, but it's actually enough to fill you up until you head out to the next spot. The waiter ran down the menu and made it easy to select food and drinks. I absolutely loved the garlic aioli that came with the fries. My burger was tasty with just a hint of spicy from the jalapeno. Perfect for a date or a girl's night out! Our reservation was made a month in advance, so plan ahead!",

It certainly was crowded! The ambiance is worth the hype! Loved the glass roof and all the greenery inside! The service was good and attentive! This is a great place for a girls night with a couple friends. \nWe started with some cocktails. I got the hot mess (tequila) and my friend got the bend and snap (gin). They were very good! \nFor food, we got a few plates and split them. The servings aren't large, so you will probably need 2-3 plates. We got the burrata, the 1000 layer potatoes and the lobster rolls. The burrata was pretty good. Very tiny though. The potatoes were amazing. You should most certainly get these! The lobster rolls were also amazing! It came with two which was perfect for the two of us. The lobster was shredded really finely which we loved! Overall such a fun experience! On the pricey side but a good place if you want to celebrate or just treat yourself!",

The place is real trendy and upbeat that the car is really nice the servers all were very friendly. The menu was pretty good all the food was very good. My favorite thing was the lobster rolls I ordered two of those and would go back just to have those. \n\nThey do require you to pay by credit card before you sit down for the brunch just a warning it is $120 per person but the vibe in the food were very good and it's not that hard to spend $120 per person what do you have a couple of mimosas and a couple of things to eat. I would definitely recommend this place and I look forward to going back",

Kind of reminded me of a bougie cheesecake factory. \n\n The only thing of value to me were the fries. I had the miso glazed pork ribs, which were fall off the bone tender, and the 1000 layer tallow potato. My friend had the lobster rolls, which were tiny AF and too fishey for me and the cucumber salad.   We ordered the skinny fries because of another table and they came with s garlic aoli. The drinks were good. I had the lemon drop with belvedere. All in all, it was cute but I would go back for the drinks. Maybe next time all try the waygu burger",

        "text": "It's not often I eat high-priced meals or venture towards Buckhead area. However, being cramped up in your home for a month and not spending money, or doing anything fun, takes it toll. My friend suggested meeting here so I was in for getting out.\n\nI highly suggest making an advance reservation, and I believe they only take them on Open Table. If you arrive here during their busy time, with no reservations, they will semi-politely have you leave. There isn't really a waiting area, and they won't take your name down. It's odd to me, but that was my story. We ended up waiting 30 minutes and finally got a seat at the bar.\n\nThe atmosphere here is awesome, and I'm guessing you really are paying for it. The entire place is set-up like a Greenhouse Garden, although it didn't look like the plants were real. I can see why people want to get a table, as the entire left side makes you feel like you are dining in a garden.\n\nWe both had drinks, and highly recommend both. Talk tiki to me and hot mess were pretty darn good. Also, expensive. I had another drink as well, but can't recall the name (mainly bc I saw someone else drinking it and decided I wanted it too).\n\nThe entree prices weren't too bad (around $18 - $50) but I opted for their small Fruits of the Sea platter for $60. Yes, pricey, but it had huge oysters, a wonderful octopus ceviche, huge shrimp and a lobster tail. Certainly not $60 worth but the quality was darn good.\n\nOverall, I really liked this place! More of a nice upscale date place for sure. Also, valet parking is located underneath it and they do validate your valet at the restaurant. Check it out!",

        "text": "After much dedication, I was able to snag a reservation to The Garden Room for 4 of us on a Friday night! We were told we had to come check this place out during our trip to Atlanta. First of all, the restaurant is absolutely stunning. Definitely one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever been to, and because of that, you're going to be upcharged on everything you order. I had seen some mixed reviews on the food, but honestly everything we had was delicious. We were just a bit upset over how small the portion sizes were. $300+ later (including tip) for 4 of us and we actually left hungry. I don't mind paying for a great meal, but we definitely felt a little ripped off. I'm giving 4 stars because overall we had a really fun time and a memorable experience with some of the interactive desserts, but I paid $30 for a wagyu pappardelle dish that came with like 4 noodles in the tiniest bowl (you can't really see the scale in the picture). The waitress informed us at the beginning that most items on their menu were to be shared, but you can barely even share with portion sizes this small. The only dish with an appropriate portion size was the Cornish hen. We're from Connecticut and were here to celebrate with friends, but we probably wouldn't come back if we were in the area again simply because of the price.",

Well I'm here to answer that question and the answer is yes!!! Our server Armani was amazing!! He made sure that we had everything we needed and answered all the questions we had about the menu. \n\nI started with a lobster roll. And yes they are small but they pack an amazing punch. It is served on a Parker House Roll, Miso, Sesame, Shiso. Delicious!! \n\nThe second offering I got was the black truffle pillows. Wild Mushroom Pasta, Parmesan, Butter, Black Pepper. It was so flavorful and I could not put the fork down. \n\nI also tried two delicious cocktails both are bourbon based. The first fall for you Angel's Envy Bourbon, Italicus Begamot, Apple Lemon, Ghost Leaf. Was divine!! The second was a new take on an old fashion. This drink was called let's get serious Pinhook Bourbon, Averna Amaro, Orange And Aztec Chocolate Bitters. The chocolate bitters really rounded out the drink. \n\nAnd of course I got dessert called forbidden fruit and it was this beautiful green apples stuffed with delicious cream and apple pieces!! I almost didn't break it. But so glad I did. \n\nWhile the prices might seem off putting they are worth it for the quality of the meal, the staff and the beautiful ambiance.",

Definitely enough to feed 2-3 people.\n\nThe drinks were pricey but I felt as if they were worth it as they were strong. The waitress recommended the Bend and Snap.

I mean it's amazing...I wanted to order more food just to stay longer!! \n\nThe service was awesome. All except for the guy that stands outside the side door. I went to the restroom and when I returned I'm standing at the door I'm looking at him and he's looking at me so I just open the door myself.  I really did expect him to open the door for me but I guess he's just there to make sure the right people go back in!!  \n\nThe food was really good..I think the atmosphere makes it great.  I got the sea bass, sliders and the forbidden fruit for dessert.  They also give a complimentary birthday dessert.  The sea bass portion size is small but it was very tasty...melt in your mouth.  The sliders were good too. Normally I'm not a dessert person so my hubby gets most of the dessert..not this go round!  \n\nWhen I first heard about it I really thought it was hyped up and probably wouldn't be so great...I was excited to go but prepared to be disappointed.   I can't wait to go back!!  It is not hype!! It wasn't too hard to get a reservation for 2 (I probably called 3 weeks out) not too sure about larger parties.  I also saw many walk-ins for the bar area. Give this place a try..you won't be disappointed.",

Went here for drinks and dessert as I'd say generally the food is a bit overpriced for the amount you get. On the other hand it does seem like they put a lot of thought into the presentation and creativity of the dishes/drinks. Also a DJ was playing music in the corner if you like that kind of vibe. Overall a fun way to end the night!",

Surprise... never heard back. \n-----\nA complete scam, with incredibly questionable service and business tactics. I came here with my sister and her friend (a total of 3 couples). The check came and it was $365/couple.  The service was terrible, and each couple tipped $50.  A few days later... each couple's tip was adjusted (+ $29).  I called the restaurant and they \"launched an investigation\" before swiftly crediting me back my money.  What's there to investigate? I had the receipt from the restaurant and the receipt from Amex.\n\nIf you can't trust this place with your money, you definitely can't trust them with their portions, ingredients, the alcohol they say they put in your drinks, etc.  I definitely won't be returning.",

        "text": "Is there a reason the \"no ball cap\" policy is only enforced with black patrons? I came tonight with a baseball cap on and was asked to remove it due to the dress code. No problem, rules are rules. However, I sat across from the door for the next three hours and watched white patrons come in with baseball caps and the only other black patron with a hat was told to remove his. Just wondering why we were targeted and why the rule isn't enforced across the board? I love Garden Room and I come often, but racial profiling just isn't cool. And I have pictures for proof. I won't post them in an effort to protect the privacy of the white patrons because they didn't do anything wrong. But it's just not cool and it's definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. Especially considering the restaurant next door great cancelled for the exact same thing 3 years ago. If the rule is no ball caps, that's fine, just enforce the rule consistently.",

        "text": "I'm first to admit I enjoy fine dining and don't mind spending $$$ dining out when warranted, but this place is a little ridiculous even for Buckhead standards. First..$12 for valet parking?!? Thank goodness the restaurant validated or I would have blown a gasket. I saw pics of the restaurant online and expected something pretty and enchanting, but the lighting was so low that I could hardly see, and the way the spotlights were set up, the effect was more tacky and seemed to have been decorated from Michael's. The music was oddly loud and clublike, making it difficult to hear my dinner companions, and overall the whole effect felt like a club from early 2000s (probably around the last time I went clubbing). The food was OK but VERY small portioned and expensive. $62 for a what looked like 4 oz of overcooked Wagyu and 5 pieces of lobster dumpling? My \"ravioli\" was a little more reasonably priced at $36 but only 5 pieces and topped with Parmesan crisps and ubiquitous foam. Dinner with tip for a party of 3 came out to $267. We skipped dessert and walked across the street to Jeni's which was sadly the best course of the night. Overall experience to quote Migos is \"bad and boujee\" and NOT in a good way. Come here if you're willing to shell out the bucks to snap some Instagram pics or Tik tok or whatever the young kids are using nowadays.",
