The food was overall really great, and even though it started to rain a bit by our area we managed to get some help to move out chairs and table closer to not get soaked! The service was great, our server was very attentive of us and she gave us some good recommendations! The ambiance was overall great too, with a variety of  music and delicious drinks! Hope to visit again some day!",

        "text": "Just OK. My husband and I decided to stop by for an early dinner and we thought it was a decent restaurant but nothing extraordinary.\n\nLos Guidry's Thoughts and Recommendations:\n- Guacamole is good! The ingredients were fresh and the portion was decent. The serrano pepper made me a little nervous since I can't do spicy but it was only a little kick. \n- Tacos were ok. We ordered the Chicken al Carbon and the Shrimp a la Plancha and thought they were fine. Nothing really special about them to be honest. And I get it, tacos are on every menu but not everyone can make authentic delicious tacos and that's ok.\n- Service was rough. We had to ask for our drinks multiple times and waited 20 minutes to get them. Just overall slow and as if the staff was in no rush to help customers.\n\nThe restaurant had a nice ambiance and cool rooftop so the vibe is right. But when it comes to the food and service I'm not quite sure this place is it.",

We stopped in for some light snacks and drinks.\n\nDrinks 4/5: We got frozen margaritas, very good. \n\nFood 4/5: We had a couple appetizers just to snack on while we had drinks and they were all good. We got the queso fundido, queso dip, guacamole, and shrimp cocktail. The shrimp cocktail was my favorite. So refreshing and light. Great flavor on it. The sauce that came with the shrimp cocktail was so good, we asked for some more on the side to eat with our other snacks. Delicious \n\nService 4/5: Polite and friendly bartender. Very patient and attentive. \n\nVibe 4/5: Good music, cute place. We sat on the roof at the bar, very peaceful at sunset. \n\nDefinitely will be back to try their other food! \n\nThank you, Azotea Cantina!",

        "text": "The first time I came to this establishment I met some friends on the rooftop. I ordered the crispy chicken tacos. They were juicy and delicious. So often fried chicken is over cooked and dry. Not these! The portion was very filling. The drinks were also well balanced. The service wasn't the best but the young man was friendly yet forgetful. I joined the party late so everyone had already eaten and cashed out. It took a very long time for the server to return with my bill. When I received my bill everything looked correct and I handed over my card. When he returned, he handed me a much higher bill with a copy to sign. When I pointed out the difference the server apologized and said he swiped my card on someone else's bill. He went back to fix it which took a while as well. When he returned he assured me it was fixed but claimed he couldn't get me a receipt.\nThe DJ was a vibe and folks actually got up and danced. This was a chill Sunday evening.\n\nMy second time patronizing this establishment was today (also Sunday). I sat on the downstairs patio with my kid. I ordered the queso which came out watery and room temperature. We both thought it was gross and pushed it to the side. I also tried an organic reposado margarita which was good. I decided after the disappointing queso I would play it safe and order the chicken tacos again. Unfortunately this time the tacos weren't great and the portion was skimpy. I took a picture because I couldn't believe how small the chicken portions were this time around. I was hungry and I am not one to complain but I was honest with the server when asked how everything was. She was nice and unapologetic. She did not offer to have a manager come over nor did she offer to remove the uneaten queso & chips from the bill. Instead she noted that's how the queso always is. No comment was made regarding my chicken tacos. \n\nThe ambiance was upbeat with salsa music playing. Not sure if I'll go back.",

It's the NBA playoffs, so I was thankful that our table was close enough to the bar so I could watch the games without straining. :D\n\nWe tried the guacamole with crispy pork and though the guac was spot with flavor and texture, I wish the pork was cut up and actually mixed in. The pieces of perfectly crispy pork were positioned around the guac mound, so you had to scoop them separately. \n\nThe shrimp tacos were by far the best taco we tried. Some places serve whole shrimp in the tortilla, but I was pleasantly surprised that Azotea cuts the shrimp -it's easier to eat this way. The shrimp was seasoned perfectly and the cheese + sauce took it over the top for me. Would absolutely order those again! \nMy friend had the steak/asada tacos and she thought they were great too!\n\nThe only thing I didn't like from our whole order was the \"suadero\" tacos. That's because they were unlike any other suadero I've had before. Disclaimer: because it's centrally located in Atlantic Station and quite popular in the evenings, it can get really loud. Be prepared to speak a bit louder to be heard by others in your dining party.\n\nOverall, this was a nice spot for afterwork dinner and drinks - would recommend!",

I visited this restaurant on a Friday night with a group to celebrate our friend's birthday celebration. You must be 21 to proceed to the upstairs rooftop. The DJ was jamming  and the food and drinks were flowing. Our waiter, Tamara, did a great job with providing attentive and friendly service to our large party of 12. Prior to ordering we were told in advance that there would be one check which gave us a chance to plan in advance on how to handle that process before folks started feeling the effects of their cocktails...lol. I only eat hard shell tacos and that's not an option provided. I enjoyed the presentation and taste of my meal--baby back ribs (Costilla de Puerco) with rice and beans. The menu was diverse and met the dietary needs of our large group which ranged from carnivores to pescatarians. Parking is plentiful in the underground parking garage. Stairwell 3 will put you close to the restaurant.",

We decided to sit at the bar. I decided to order guacamole !! It was soooo good and the Carne Asada Tacos!! They were amazing. For drinks we had the blackberry Margarita. It was sweet but be careful, the alcohol sneaks up on you lol. We went on a Thursday it was chill ( like I like it) Khalea mentioned the crowds come in on Fridays and Saturdays.

Not a huge a queso fan, but this one was really good; they added some spices and little onion etc to kick it up a notch, and I also really liked the tortilla chips.\n\nYou can't mix and match tacos. You get 3 of a kind, but we split the baja fish and portobello Both types were good but neither were amazing, and I would have found either option a little small without some kind of side or app. I liked the amount of kick but they do deserve a spicy warning.",

        "text": "Azotea Cantina is great option for those looking for a quick taco fix. I sometimes have to travel to Atlanta for work and the home office is right within Atlantic Station. I've been here about four times and finally snapped a few photos for a proper review.\n\nOn my most recent visit (3/1/22) I took several work colleagues out to lunch. I kept it simple and ordered the fish tacos. How is the food? It's fine and nothing special. It hits the spot to be sure. It's *almost* impossible to have a bad taco in my humble opinion.\n\nI suppose I would equate it to eating McDonalds in Europe. It's a taste of home but not really. What am I talking about? The best fish tacos in the known world are in Mexico and Southern California. Therefore everyone is playing for second place including Azotea Cantina. I get the taste of home which comforts me if not blowing my socks off. A decent taco (which these are) is far better than NO taco at all.\n\nYMMV",

It was clear that they were short staffed but they were doing their best with the staff that was there. Our waiter was friendly and we ordered everything right away. Our food came out before our drinks, the waiter apologized and explained they were short staffed and then brought our drinks.

        "text": "I came here one night with my boyfriend after seeing this place on instagram. I wanted so bad to like it but service was horrible (I sat at the upstairs bar) as the bartender was completely aloof and had no idea on how to man a bar. My boyfriend waited 20 minutes for his first drink. We literally watched her make drinks for people who had sat down after us bc she didn't want to go downstairs and get another bottle of makers mark. Not to mention the bartender was serving one customer who was clearly drunk that she should've cut off. To make it worst, the rice in my bowl was soggy. How do you mess up rice at a Mexican restaurant ? The cheese dip was good so at least I can say that. Unfortunately, I will never be back. Horrible experience.

Azotea's website provides directions to get to the restaurant, so make sure you check before you go so you don't get lost in Atlantic station. \n\nTheres plenty of seating downstairs, upstairs, and outside on the rooftop, but it gets pretty busy so reservations are definitely encouraged. We started with the salsa trio which had a super interesting pumpkin salsa, a generic red salsa, a generic salsa verde, and homemade chips. \n\nI then had tacos for my main course and ended the night with churros. The tacos were small, but they were absolutely PACKED with delicious toppings. The churros were also amazing and I loved the chocolate dipping sauce that came with them.\n\nAzotea is a must try taco place in atlanta, and it'll definitely be an addition to my list of favorite restaurants!",

The bar is inside, some dinning table are inside others are located outside on the roof-top near the DJ booth. I know for sure they  have a DJ on Saturdays. The restaurant gets super busy so your best bet is to go early or make a reservation. \nThe bar scene on the first floor is trendy and chic. Great place to mingle and meet new people. \nThis restaurant is located in Atlantic Station. It replaced the other Mexican restaurant that used to be there.",

We had a large Group and wanted to sit on the roof the people upstairs servers had such an attitude, (bartenders were good and polite) but the servers acted as if they were doing us a favor \nIn total there were about 10-12 people in our group and I spent well over $1k on drinks alone I have no issue with the prices I just want to state that we spent money and ordered plenty of drinks which were  ok but the service was horrible, slow and just unprofessional, rude !!! Good luck we should have just gone somewhere else I was embarrassed I invited our out of town guest to meet us there . Step it up Azotea Cantina Service is lousy slow unprofessional and remember you aren't doing me a favor by bring me my drink !!!  I personally have no need to ever return to this place there are plenty of restaurants with better food drinks and Especially Service !!",

We had the carbs asada tacos....spicy but amazing; Baja fish tacos....the cabbage slaw on top really complements the fish; the rice and beans were my favorite.....not sure what kind of beans they were but the flavors were great and matched well with the tacos; the guacamole with cojiti cheese and pork belly (odd but why not) was really good. \n\nThe staff.......as soon as we walked in a waitress was standing at the hostess booth looking like today was not her day. She, roamed the restaurant no smile, servers were standing around, the only who greeted us was our main server. It took her a minute to greet us but was very nice. I would love to give this a 4.5 but with the restaurant in a centrally tourist location, customer service is key. \n\nYes I will come back and hope the service is better.",

Texture and flavor wise, the combination of the cauliflower, garlic aioli, sweet potatoes, cilantro, lime and corn tortillas made an excellent combination for a party of flavors. The mocktail was so yummy and tasted like a orange creamsicle drink. The owner of the establishment visited my table and had a very funny since of humor and lovely southern hospitality. The bartender/server was very nice and attentive as well. My friend had the fish tacos and the way she raved over them, I will be trying those next. The rooftop ambiance is beautiful and spacious.",

She was knowledgeable, friendly, and had a knack for making spot-on recommendations which made our culinary journey through the menu a memorable one. Her service was attentive without being intrusive, striking the perfect balance that made our meal enjoyable.\n\nA special shoutout to Donovan and the chef, who are the managers at Azotea. They made a point to check on us, ensuring that everything was to our liking. Their professionalism and personable nature added a special touch to the evening. The chef's expertise was apparent in the delectable dishes we savored - each bite was a burst of flavor that had us yearning for more.\n\nThe team at Azotea Cantina, especially Kalia, Donovan, and the chef, truly know how to provide an exceptional dining experience.

For apps, we ordered queso, which was extremely watery and guacamole which had no ounce of flavor at all. I never like asking a server to take food back and remove it from the bill, but they were both just nasty. Then the tacos came to the table, just the presentation alone was a sign for disaster. The shrimp was bland and there were no condiments on it but cheese and old cilantro. I highly recommend NOT dining in here, unless you want a drink only.",

Their take on ahi tuna nachos was so tasty and their guacamole dip could be eaten with a spoon. For my order I got the Tostad de Ahi Tuna. It's sushi grade tuna, avocado, and morita aioli served on a tostada. At first I was afraid it wasn't enough (I eat a lot) but after three and all of the guac I downed I was stuffed! I may have also snuck a couple of bites of my wife's taco and let me tell you for a person that doesn't eat steak EVER..this thing was on point. The Bistec Alamore has grilled ribeye, onions, queso, crispy bacon and topped with papa fritas (French fries)! SAY WHAT!? The server was also very professional and made sure all of our needs were met. Oh did I mention the rooftop bar???? Adults only though! The only reason I'm not going to five stars is their bus boy decided he needed to sweep under our table while we were eating...even hit my foot with the broom. I'll be going back though!",

No one came to help us for a while so my friend got up and went to the bar to ask.  Finally someone came over and we placed the order for drinks and food.  The drinks, the tacos and the guacamole were ok...good but nothing stood out.  The guacamole lacked flavor...just tasted like a mashed up avocado.",
