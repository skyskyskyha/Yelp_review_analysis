                "text": "Date night was such a wonderful experience! Hal's has a very warm, cozy atmosphere. We actually went to the movies first, and ended up finishing well before our reservation. We decided to go to the restaurant early and just to see if they would accommodate us. And wouldn't you know, they did so within a matter of 20 minutes. In mind you we were about an hour and 15 minutes early. So I greatly appreciated that.\n\nThe staff was absolutely warm, welcoming, very attentive, and courteous. They even had a lot of musician playing on the ivories, which was a really really nice touch. I enjoyed that. He had a really good playlist of songs that catered to all. And the food, it was very very good, our steak was perfectly seasoned perfectly cooked and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The spinach was delicious as well, but , we weren't impressed with the salad nor were we impressed with the grilled asparagus. They were very basic. But everything else was really good!",

                "text": "Hals truly delivered an exceptional evening, and it all began with the attentive service of our host, Phillip (who, incidentally, bears a striking resemblance to Chris Pratt).\n\nWe embarked on a delightful wine journey under Phillip's guidance, as he deftly tailored our selections to our preferences, making each glass a new discovery.\n\nThe A5 wagyu beef sampler was a highlight--four ounces of sheer indulgence that practically dissolved on the tongue. It was a challenge to resist ordering seconds (or thirds) of this heavenly creation.\n\nNext up were the escargot, a garlicky, buttery delight that set the tone for the feast to come. Alongside, we sampled oysters that were fresh, briny, and a perfect precursor to the evening's festivities.\n\nOur main courses were a carnivore's dream lineup: cowboy steaks, a tender filet, and sides that were just as memorable, crispy brussels sprouts and delicious potatoes. \n\nIn conclusion, Hals offers an exceptional dining experience that balances superb service with culinary artistry. If you find yourself craving an unforgettable night filled with outstanding wines, succulent meats, and a touch of unexpected delight, look no further than Hals. You'll leave with a satisfied palate and a desire to return for more.",

We were invited to join a few of my colleagues for dinner and the experience was top tier from start to finish! Hal's does steak right. The steak was lightly seasoned, charred, and cooked to perfection no steak sauce needed. The fried lobster was delicious also. The sides were huge so we decided to share. Creamy spinach, Mashed potatoes, and Lobster Mac n cheese were very tasty as well. All noteworthy additions to any meal. Even though the place was packed service was great. Our waiter gave us a tiramisu dessert on the house and then asked me was I ready for the \"damage report\" referring to the bill. That was the best laugh I've had in a while. But he was right and next time we'll be sure to label this one as a \"business meeting\" lol. \n\nValet parking available for $5 \nBusiness casual dress code for men. No athletic gear.\n\nEnjoy",

Their garlic bread was great too. We enjoyed the 12 ounce filet split and shared the Brussels and white truffle lobster mac and cheese. Everything was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. We finished with the tiramisu which was made well. Couldn't have asked for a better date night dinner and we've been to all the greats in Atlanta. Make sure you add this one to your list.",

The service is phenomenal, food is consistently good, and ambiance great. \n\nThey do have Valet Parking available which is great for this area ($5). Gentleman you must be dressed correctly (check the dress code), however you will have an amazing time!\n\nFor this trip, I had an old fashion and a Manhattan for my drinks which were A1! For food, I had the Mac n cheese, Brussels, skinny onion straws and the 22 oz bone in rib eye (cooked medium).\n\nEverything was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Steak was a little over cooked for medium, but still great. \n\nAgain, the consistency here has kept me returning and not wanting to try new steakhouses! Highly recommend trying out this staple in atlanta!",

Sat in the upstairs dining room. Our table was right across from the ac vent and when we mentioned it was cold, our waiter Jonas had them lower the temperature right away. Much appreciated!\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine with our meal. They brought out complimentary bread basket which was sliced garlic bread. Yum!\nStarted with the appetizer special of fried lobster medallions in a butter creme sauce. We then moved to both sizes of the ribeyes.  We shared sides of lobster Mac and onion rings. Be aware that the steaks come with a small side already so we should have only gotten one more to share because with the steaks and other sides we ordered there was way too much food. Everything was delicious!!  Steaks done perfectly to temp. The creamed spinach was awesome and onion rings omg!  The lobster Mac was the only thing I had an issue with. Creamy and cheesy but the only lobster to be found was the lobster tail garnish on the dish. Not a single piece to be found in the whole dish :/. \n\nService was excellent and attentive, thanks Jonas! We then had the cheesecake and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e desserts.  The one thing that took away from the experience was the noise level.  We were seated on upstairs patio and could barely hear each other across the table, a small two top. This took a bit away from the ambiance of the place. We could hear all the conversations at nearby tables as it seemed folks were shouting to be heard. \nOverall, we enjoyed the meal and the experience.",

If you want to see a bunch of hookers and smoke cigars...this is your place. Downstairs is more of a lounge for some dudes looking for a hookup with working ladies. Upstairs is for dining and such, but just doesn't meet the cut versus other options. \n\nPerfectly nice place with two different atmospheres  (upstairs and downstairs). Just not my vibe. \n\nIt's an Atlanta institution so if you live in Atlanta you should check it off your list. And if you are an old rich dude looking for a gold digger that will end up finishing her night later at Johnnie's Hideaway, go blow $500 at Hal's. \n\nFor a date night.......maybe go somewhere else.",

As you may recall, our initial experience was marred by an unfortunate incident that left us deeply disappointed.\n\nHowever, the next evening, we were pleasantly surprised when Sammy, one of the owners of Hal's, reached out to us personally. Sammy not only offered a sincere apology but also took the time to thoroughly investigate the situation. He reviewed video footage, consulted with staff, and engaged in a thoughtful conversation with us, listening attentively for over half an hour to our feedback, which he carefully noted.\n\nDuring our conversation, we emphasized the importance of a more measured and discreet approach when addressing issues related to attire, especially in situations where there might be ambiguity. We suggested that assessing the situation calmly and consulting with management first would be a more considerate approach, and Sammy wholeheartedly agreed. He even mentioned that he would bring this valuable insight to the next staff meeting to ensure such incidents are handled better in the future.\n\nIn addition to addressing our concerns, Sammy showed incredible compassion and understanding regarding my partner's health condition. He went above and beyond by sending a stunning bouquet of flowers with a personal note to my partner.  This gesture touched our hearts deeply.\n\nWe are genuinely appreciative of Sammy's dedication to making immediate changes to the dress policy and improving the way such situations are managed. It's evident that Hal's is committed to ensuring every guest receives the respect and consideration they deserve.\n\nWe now look forward with anticipation to revisiting Hal's in the near future, not only to experience your renowned cuisine but also to say hello to Sammy and, hopefully, meet Mr. Hal himself.\n\nThank you once again for your swift and compassionate response. It has truly turned our initial disappointment into a positive and hopeful experience.\n\nWarm regards, Matt",

                "text": "I made a reservation at Hal's over a month in advance.  I'm not sure how late you can still make one, but they were quite crowded when we dined there on a Saturday, so my advice is to book early.\n\nWe arrived around 6 p.m.  They feature valet parking in a short loop in front of the restaurant. Note also that when you leave the restaurant, you cannot really turn right (towards Piedmont Ave.) as Old Ivy Road dead-ends just before that for some reason. \n\nYou enter via a ramp from the valet station. They had a security guy manning the door when we got there, though the area didn't seem unsafe by any measure.  Maybe they have a fair percentage of rich diners and they just want to discourage any sort of 'invasive' robbery...\n\nWhen you enter, you are facing an elevator up to the 2nd floor. Turn left instead to the host station.  The interior or the restaurant here was very dark.  Maybe it was just the transition from the bright sunlight outside to this interior, but as we were led up the stairs beyond the elevator, I had to take it slow and pay close attention to even see the stairs.  We ended up circling around to a sort of windowed balcony on the 2nd floor, which was quite light and airy (especially compared to the stairs). \n\nThe overall vibe I got was 'money'.  This is a relatively expensive restaurant, and the clientele seemed to reflect that.  There was significant percentage of 'old money' looking tables, along with a mix of families celebrating graduations, and younger tables of people gathering for whatever.  There were a few couples like us as well. \n\nService was swift and efficient, as tends to be the case in places like this. There is no shortage of servers and they tend to combine on a table the way pit crews handle formula 1 cars (in a generally good way).  \n\nWe both got the filets, where were both large, expensive, and a good cut of meat cooked very well. There are a few 'standard' side dishes also, though you can up-change them.  We both liked our mashed potatoes, though the portions there were more modest compared to the steaks. We split a salad which turned out to be a good idea, as even split we each had plenty.  We also split a dessert, which was also large. \n\nAs for drinks, they appeared to have an extensive wine menu.  I heard an adjoining table negotiating for what sort of scotch they would get in their cocktail, and the list seemed to go on for a while.  So I you are in to higher end spirits, this may also be the place for you.\n\nThis may have just been related to where we got seated or the nearby tables, but by the end of the meal the noise level had ramped up significantly.  It had been much quieter at the outset. I'm not sure which noise level is the norm. \n\nOverall, we both liked our meals here quite a bit.  It is certainly not a place that we'd go on a whim, but for a rare splurge meal, this is a great option.",

                "text": "While Hal's is usually a staple for us in terms of absolutely great food all the time, we were slightly disappointed on our last visit due to the chopped salad. It is not really salad at all; it is finally chopped celery and carrot mixed in with lettuce that is also very finely minced. However, what surprised me the most was that after we told the waiter that the chopped salad was not at all what we expected, and that we did not really like it, the waiter did not offer to take it back or replace it with another salad. I would've really thought he would do that. So, it was disappointing service-wise. Luckily, the lobster bites were terrific as always, and the blackened filet mignon was delicious.",

In Atlanta, I've dined at a number of traditional steak houses and found this one to be the least impressive. No one in my party had steak, I tried to order steak, but my waiter actually talked me out of it. I don't believe he meant to, but my roast chicken was quite good. Good sides with the Lobster Mac, Brussels, mashed potatoes.  Louisiana style oysters were also good. It's difficult to have too much garlic. Speaking of garlic the bread was really good. Drinks were ok, old fashioned's were not well mixed and we ordered plenty lol. Nothing special but good meal at typical prices for a place like this.",

Food & services was a win for me. \n\nFood:\nChar grilled oysters (appetizer)- this app was good but not the best oysters I've had. I believe the cheese on top was baked too long and made the oysters had a burnt taste to it but I will give them a pass since this is not a seafood restaurant.\n\nSnapper franchaise- so flavorful, cooked just right and the lemon butter sauce was a great addition.\n\nPrime bone in rib-eye- recommend by server since it was both me and my boyfriends first time and I must say one of the best steaks he has ever eaten. Very flavorful, tender and melts right in your mouth.\n\nSides- Ordered broccoli and white truffle mac & cheese. When food came out they accidentally gave us two more additional sides which was mashed potatoes and their spaghetti. A lot of upscale restaurants don't make broccoli good but this broccoli was perfectly cooked. Mac and cheese was excellent especially even with them using white cheese. The spaghetti was surprisingly good and the mashed potatoes were just ok I will pass on them but can't complain about when they were free.\n\nThe server Hakan was absolutely the best and very attentive to us even with how tight the restaurant seating is.\n\nWe will definitely be back.",

We were happy about it though because we were nervous it'd be dead which wouldn't be as fun of an atmosphere. We were wrong though - the ambience was perfect! The garlic bread was delicious as well as the wine. I was surprised the glasses of wine were decently affordable - especially for having over a 4.0 on vivino! My husband ordered the 22 oz bone-in ribeye so I decided to get the trout with lump crabmeat since it was a little more affordable than the steak and I knew he wouldn't be able to eat all 22 ounces. The steak was definitely better than the trout but that's expected - sort of wish I had opted for a pasta dish instead. For sides we ordered the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach - both were fantastic. We were planning on ordering dessert but were way too full by the end of our meal. Even if you don't want to pay the price of the steak but want the upscale environment, I think this is a great place to go because you can order a pasta for under $30 and a glass of wine for about $11.",

Usually go with the ribeye and lobster tail. The restaurant is a bit noisy but not noisy enough to deter me from dining. The service is always great as well!",

When we arrived we were quickly greeted by valet and shown the front door to walk in. Once inside we spoke with the host to get checked in while we waited for the rest of our group and everyone was very friendly. Once everyone arrived, we were walked upstairs to our table. There was a live band on site this night and they have speakers connected around the restaurant so you are able to hear it from anywhere which was nice. Now, on to the food! We knew we made the right choice when the bread and butter came out to the table and it was hot and delicious; our server kept this coming for us! We tried a variety of different menu items around the table; we started with the oysters and the lobster bites (8/10). For entrees we tried the lobster mac 7/10 and the oven roasted chicken over mashed potatoes (8/10). We will be back for sure!",

Our server was wonderful - funny, kind, and helpful. \n\nWe did not start with any appetizers and just had the bread with butter which I enjoyed a lot. For the main course I got a bone in filet au povre and my partner got the filet Cajun style. Such tender meat & great flavors just exploding in my mouth. \n\nThey also had fresh Maine lobster that night so we split a lobster tail that was steamed with a butter lemon sauce. For sides - the mashed potatoes are AMAZING! Since it was our anniversary, we got a little dessert on the house which was a cheesecake with fresh strawberry compote on top. \n\nThe atmosphere was very interesting, dim lighting and loud-ish music, people smoking cigars at the bar, lots of business folks around having meals. \n\nI enjoyed the experience and would like to come back again soon!",

This place was packed on a Tuesday night which tells me this place must be something special. \n\nAnother thing have to shout out before I get into the food is the staff. From the front door, to the table, bussers and waiters these folks are not only super friendly but they hustle. The busyness of the restaurant was impressive but was more impressive is how hard the men and women of Hals work. I didn't mention above and should've included but the bartenders and cooks crank out the food and drinks despite how busy. \n\nFor food I will start off and say that everything was amazing from start to finish and I will try and capture what I can. A little pre-warning even though the garlic bread they drop off on the table is amazing don't dive to deep because this could be a meal wrecker. We started off with the fried lobster, calamari and some oysters. First the fried lobster was life changing the smokiness of flavor combined with the lobster was outstanding. The calamari was perfectly cooked and the homemade sauce was truly remarkable. Then the oysters from Canada tasted so fresh and couldn't resist having a few extra.  \n\nFor dinner I had the special bone in filet and it was really special.  The flavors that the attached none brought out where simply amazing and yes I put aside my pride and ate some of that meat right off the bone while boxing up the rest for a buddies dog. We also enjoyed in order and I will rank. \n1) Lobster Mac 5 star \n2) Cream Spinach 4 star \n3) Truffle Mac 5 star \n4) Brussel sprouts 5 star magical \n\nNow after eating and being in a slight meat coma my friends wanted desert and the only thing we said was you pick and bring out your favorites. Our desert was the equivalent of a seafood tower. It was filled with all sorts delicious selections including ice cream, tiramisu, 2 cheese cakes, bread pudding and some chocolate desert that everyone raved about. \n\nAll in all this was an amazing experience and couldn't say enough compliments on what a great time we all had at Hal's...if your in Atlanta and don't try out Hal's your missing out on an experience you won't forget.",

Although it's $$$$ it is the one place that constantly is worth it. We dined for my beau's birthday and had reservations (recommended). I love that we dined early (5:30pm) because it was not loud and not crowded, though the place was packed by the time we left. Our server, Kevin Schiltz was AMAZING, and we basically entrusted our entree and wine selection to him and he could not have chosen better. Do not miss the fact that these servers are PROFESSIONAL, jazzing build stellar decades long careers. You will want for nothing and the ambience and decor still gives me old NYC steakhouse. The cocktails are unrivaled and the wine list is certain to have something to your liking. We ordered the bone-in filet special and BLT Wedge special. Also ordered the Escargot, bone-in ribeye and lobster-truffle Mac (special). Enjoyed every moment of this meal. Will be back again when an occasion arises.",

                "text": "We had a dinner reservation for 2 at 7:00 pm on Monday, 10/24/22. Jonas was our waiter and he was wonderful! Service was great. They allow smoking at the bar downstairs, but upstairs is smoke-free. There was a wide range of people - people on dates, large parties, and business-people. The food was super good!\n\nWe each got an appetizer, a steak (comes with a small side of creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and one other choice - it was the perfect size!), two sides, and dessert. We had so much leftover. We easily each got 2 meals out of it. If we came with more people next time, I would get the sides, but for just 2, it's unnecessary. Here's what we got:\n- Beef Steak Tomato and Onion Salad ($10.95): Good, but not crazy good that you need to get it.\n- Shrimp Remoulade ($14.95): My husband enjoyed this!\n- Hal's Ribeye 20 oz. ($71.95): My husband loved this!! He got the creamed spinach and said it was the best he's ever had. I'm normally not a huge fan of creamed spinach, but I went back for more!\n- Filet Mignon 12 oz. ($66.95): Super good! The flavor was amazing. The crispness on the outside was perfection. I got the mashed potatoes as my side and they were sooo good.\n- White Truffle Macaroni and Cheese ($12): I love mac and cheese, and while this was good, I don't think it's a must-order for 2 people. If you have more people in your party to split it with, then go for it.\n- Brussels ($12): Suuuuper good. I would definitely recommend this.\n- Chocolate Cake ($9.95): We wished this was more like chocolate lava cake. It wasn't warm like we wanted it to be. Still tasted good!\n\nWe enjoyed Hal's! We recommend and would also go back ourselves. Some of the best steak we've had in Atlanta.",

The waitstaff (who all were super helpful) made sure that I tried the ribeye.  I was NOT disappointed.  It was tender and juicy and didnt need much of anything on it.  It was already flavorful, right out the gate.  I did have a salad and some potatoes, but that wasnt what I came for!  The Lyonnaise potatoes were a bit sweet for me, not sure why, but I am used to having more salt or garlic, but not sweet.  I think that I have had Mortons too many times and I am accustomed to a certain flavor of potato, but it was definitely not a deal breaker.  And again... I came for steak!  I would most definitely go back!  Also, you could smoke cigars at the bar, which I liked because I enjoy cigars and a good beer too, that was great for the ambience!",

There is no waiting area so we were standing in the bar/ dining area for an hour. They also allow smoking which in that crowded place was suffocating. \nThe live piano playing was beautiful and set a nice mood for the dark atmosphere. \nOnce seated i noticed one of my friends glasses was broken and cracked all the way down the cup and I am glad she didn't drink from it because it would've cut her mouth badly. \nWe ordered a bottle of Stella Rosa moscato for $42. Which if you go to a grocery store, is $12. \nThe prices were expensive but sadly I can't say the food was worth the prices. Everything was good but not amazing.\nI personally wouldn't go back due to the negatives of my experience.",

I deviated from the rest of the table by not ordering steak and decided to try one of my favorite dishes, the duck a l'orange. I am someone who often will add extra salt to my dishes, but the duck was so salty that I couldn't even eat it. (I see that another reviewer had a similar experience 10 days ago). Our attentive waiter noticed and immediately offered to bring my second choice instead; the veal marsala. He got my replacement dish out quickly.  It too was extremely salty, and far from tender; unusual for veal.  Since my companions were almost finished, I just had him box it to bring home for my teenagers and dog. \nOn the other hand, my gumbo was excellent, as were the vegetable sides and my wife's crab salad. \nAtmosphere was extremely noisy with loud music overwhelming the full boisterous crowd. \nSaturday night at Hal's...",

                "text": "I have always loved the food at Hal's. On yesterday November 11th I had a birthday dinner there. I booked a 20 seat table weeks before time. All 20 of my party members were there and ready to sit at 8 pm. I asked the host (male, latino, gray jacket) when would our table be available. He stated your party has to be here. I replied to him that all 20 of us are here and then he stated, angrily, \"I don't see 20 people\". I again replied that we are all here. He then ignored me. \n\n All while this was going on two individuals from my party sat at the bar. This was their first time meeting each other. They had drinks. After their drinks were done the bartender brought back one check and my two party members paid. After observing the receipt they noticed charges that were not theirs. The bartender not only charged the two individuals jointly she charged a random man's food on their check. Her response was all three of you looked like you were here together. After going back and forth for over 20 minutes a manager came and fixed the check. \n\nAt exactly 8:34 I asked the host again when would the table be ready? The host again stated that he needed to see 20 people. Mind you, my entire party had been ready at 8 pm. I stated to him again that all of my party was there and some people were just at the bar upstairs. At around 8:42 two young ladies walked up to me and said that my table was ready. I asked them who was the host at the host stand, they both laughed after I stated that he was extremely rude and short with me. They stated that he was always rude. \n\nWe dined and our waiters were all attentive and great. The food was awesome as always. After I finished my meal I had some steak and Brussels sprouts leftover. I asked one of the waiters that was helping our waiter for a box. He volunteered to box up my food. My food never came back from the kitchen. I let the waiter know that my food never came back out. The waiter then comped my meal\u200b.\n\nI want to reiterate that my waiter was awesome, the food was good, and we enjoyed our time ONCE WE SAT DOWN TO EAT outside of my food being lost. I want also stress that the way the bartender and especially the male host handled us was unacceptable and does not represent the level of service expected from an establishment such as Hal's. The host was extremely short tempered, unprofessional, disinterested in providing good service.",

A great piece of meat! The side of mashed potatoes was soso and too tiny to be taken seriously...some improvement possible here. The creme brulee again hit the spot. \n\nI expected a quieter old school steakhouse but this is more a ruff and tumble bar/restaurant with some patrons visibly strained beyond their comfort level to satisfy the dress code.
