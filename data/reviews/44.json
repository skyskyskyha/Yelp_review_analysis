        "text": "My husband and o went here for a date night. First time coming to this restaurant which I found solely through Yelp. We love tapas so we were really looking forward to it. \n\nThey have so much varied that you'll have to visit several times to try everything you want. \n\nWe got the following...\n1. Skirt steak salad - delicious well cooked steak and fantastic dressing. Wish the portion was lettuce was more since that's why I get salads but the flavors were great.\n2. Barbacoa nachos - these were some of the best nachos I've ever had. This was our favorite thing of the night and plan on just getting two of these next time. \n3 trailer park taco - this was my favorite taco of the night. Fried chicken and queso. You can't go wrong\n3. Grilled shrimp taco - this was my second favorite of the night. The corn bean salsa was tasty. And the aioli really brought everything together. \n4. Grilled steak taco, Korean bbq taco, carnitas taco, chicken tinga taco - all of these were good but nothing special. Glad we tried them but I would not order again. \n5. Mac and cheese - this was tasty. I don't think you can mess up mac and cheese. \n\nNext time we plan on getting more of the dishes and less of the tacos. The paella and shrimp a la Catalan looked great. \n\nService from Jake was excellent as well! Super nice and friendly!\n\nDefinitely recommend!",

We called ahead the same day for a reservation and had a nice table on their heated covered back patio.\n\nEverything on the menu looked great and I had trouble deciding what to order! The menu is divided between tapas to share and individual tacos. Here are some of the things we tried:\n\n* Salsa Duo\n* Guacamole\n* Whole Roasted Cauliflower\n* Octopus\n* Lobster taco\n\nMy favorites of these were the octopus and the lobster taco. The taco was a perfect size! I loved the cauliflower as well. It's a large portion and can be shared with multiple people. While the guacamole was good I felt the portion was pretty small for the price.\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed my visit and would definitely recommend checking them out. The service was really nice and they have a really large patio in the back that's covered with heaters for the winter months!",

The brisket Mac n cheese is a staple, and maybe a little gimmicky, but still delicious. \n\nMy favorite taco that I had was the Peruvian chicken taco. Just the right amount of savory flavor and the salsa/veggies they put on it was fresh AF.\n\nI honestly don't remember the last taco I had based on the picture I took. \n\nDefinitely need to return and try more of their menu!\n\nStaff members were following covid guidelines as well, and the patrons seemed appropriately distanced.",

        "text": "Let's get into it ! \nWent here last night with 3 friends for a birthday. Just to set the scene. \n\nLocation: the place is the cutest spot over in Virginia highlands. With that said parking in a nightmare as always. This is true atl parking. So either find it or pay for it. I found a free one on the side of the street. Easy to find big sign on front as seen in picture. \n\nDrinks: of course I had to indulge in the margaritas! I had the \" love for mango \" which was amazing ! If I got the name wrong it's not on the main menu so it could be speciality! \n\nFood: \nI will say that when they say they food will come out fast. That was not a lie! We was running out of space on our table to keep up. We ordered all the tapas to start before heading to the taco dept. \n\nWe had : calamari : fried golden, aioli was amazing, a sprinkle of lemon good to go! \nGarlic -chile shrimp/fresh bread : flavorful and great. Loved the big juicy shrimp that was given and the bread was amazing. I could eat it all night. \nGuacamole: (not pictured) amazing flavor. I got some on my finger putting some on my plate. Game over ! Also this is when they brought out CORN tortilla chips and baby we threw the flour away. (I love corn all things )\nMexican street corn : was decent. Lacked the flavor , the lime helped but still needed more I don't think I tasted any cheese. Could of passed. Disappointing. \nSalsa duo: it's salsa so meh. \nShrimp a la Catalan: (not pictured ) is what good, but no robust flavor more like tomato sauces shrimp. Could of passed on this one. \n\nThe tacos : \nAll tacos can come on corn or flour if you wish to request. If you don't request they give you what they feel Match the taco. \nLamb barbaco: (not eaten by me) I was told it was ok not a fan fav the lamb was shredded but decent. \nGrilled shrimp: this was the best one to me that I ate. Had good flavor the aioli was great not dry juicy and flavor. \nBaja: it was ok. They had the right idea but mine was missing the aioli so that made it super dry and I was uninterested after a few bites. The fish was cooked good and perfectly crispy on the fry. Just no flavor. \nSalmon: the pineapple was a great addition to this taco in the salad on top and the salmon was good. It is a sweet taco nothing savory about it. The fruit shined ! \n\nAll in all I would come back for different tapas and drinks but not a fan favorite hence the 4 star. The waiter he was great and even bought the birthday girl a shot ! I appreciated him the most !",

Paid valet and self parking around the corner. Seated quickly.\n\nThis place has been hyped up for a while now among people I know, and it didn't hit the mark for me. Service was lackluster as we had to hound our server pretty often to get anything which understandable with staffing shortage so it's fine. However, we ordered quite a bit of food and drink and nothing was memorable. \n\nI had the house margarita which was pretty meh with muddled flavors. As for dinner, we ordered a range of tapas including the baked queso, Spanish potatoes, Mac and cheese, sautéed mushrooms, beef empanadas, carne asada, and mussels. Despite so much food, none of it was amazingly tasty. Everything was cooked well but seasoning just wasn't there. \n\nDespite the lackluster flavoring, I understand the appeal of this spot with a great location in VaHi and a fun atmosphere!",

However, we were VERY pleasantly surprised at how great everything was!\n\nThe menu was extremely diverse, with everything from bacon-wrapped dates to Mac and cheese brisket tacos! \n\nThe staff was also very polite, and our server was awesome! Extremely attentive, despite the hefty crowd, and he had a great sense of humor! \n\nTo top it all off, the food came out VERY quickly, and my wife and I were able to eat more than our fill (2 appetizers, 4 tacos) AND get drinks for $60! \n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for a fun hangout dinner, but maybe not the kind of place for a cutesy, quiet date, unless you're able to get a seat in the little alley right outside.",

I asked the waiter (same person who seated me) about drink recommendations and he didn't seem too knowledgeable about the menu...\nI chose a margarita and it was ok, I definitely expected a stronger kick considering tequila is in the sign under the name.\nI really enjoyed the barbacoa nachos. My friend ordered chips and guac, and his chips were really really greasy...unlike my chips in the nachos, so that was interesting.\n\nI also had the trailer park taco. I'd pass on the tacos next time. It wasn't bad, but it also isn't something to pay for. My friend didn't enjoy his grilled steak taco either.\n\nIf I'm in the area, I would consider going back for the nachos. The ambiance was nice, but the place is pretty small and my experience didn't live up to my expectations.",

When we got into the restaurant, we were told that they were completely booked for the evening but could try to snag a table outside or at the bar. Luckily a table outside opened up shortly after and we were able to sit down. They were able to clean the table very quickly and bring us an extra chair. \n\nThe food: The three of us ordered 5 tapas and it was plenty. We even had leftovers. We got the octopus (delicious especially the sauce), barbacoa nachos (pretty good but nothing special), pork carnitas (so tender and flavorful), beef and potato empanadas (crunchy on the outside and beefy on the inside), and the paella. The paella was off tasting due to the burnt mussel shells that ruined the rest of the dish. \n\nThe service: Could be better. We wanted to ask the server about the paella, but no one came back to our table after our tapas were delivered. Tried to wash the burnt taste from our mouths, but never got water refilled either.",

I was hungry so I appreciated getting the food out fast, but our meal definitely felt rushed. I would've liked to have the tapas more spaced out so I could enjoy the ambiance more. \n\nThe cauliflower was really good, but be warned - not everything cauliflower is healthy. This was completely drenched in butter and cheese. The cauliflower is sitting in a puddle of butter. But my gosh, it was delicious.\n\nThe drinks were good. The margaritas were strong. The sangria was good as well, but I've definitely had better.\n\nThe carnitas were also really good, some of the best I had. And the empanadas were also really good. For two people, I'd suggest getting two of the smaller tapas (under $10) and one larger one (more expensive, such as the cauliflower).\n\nOverall, Bar-Bacoa was a solid spot.",

        "text": "We thought this place was OK.\n\nBar-Bacoa (technically, stylized as Bar.bacoa) opened in January 2019. It's the current tapas restaurant to occupy the space long filled by Noche and later, Tom Tom and Taco Cowboy, in the heart of Virginia-Highland. Along with tapas, this place also serves tacos and has a small, but happening bar. If you ever came to this spot in any of its previous incarnations, the look and feel is generally the same; the difference is in the details.\n\nFree parking is available behind the restaurant in a lot shared with other businesses in the same corner strip (enter/exit via North Highland Ave NE). I parked on the street (also free, on Virginia Ave NE) which is what I normally do when visiting most parts of Virginia-Highland. You can park on the residential offshoots (e.g. Vance, Maryland) too.\n\nWe visited on a Friday night at 7:30pm with reservations booked via OpenTable. Book your reservations for free using OpenTable and earn dining points that can be used towards future discounts at other OpenTable restaurants or redeemed for an Amazon gift card. The restaurant was busy, but not completely full, the entire time we were there (probably at 80% average capacity).\n\nThis restaurant has a casual, laid back atmosphere. They've got their bar up front, dining room in the middle, and patio seating out back. The patio, which overlooks the parking lot, is shared with neighboring restaurants, La Tavola and Fontaine's Oyster House. Overall, the place isn't very big. It can get loud and feel crowded. If there's just two of you and you choose to dine inside, you may be seated at one of the two-tops along the banquette, close to other pairs/couples which can potentially make things a little awkward/uncomfortable. I like the patio and chose to dine there like I have for La Tavola and Fontaine's. The patio is covered and has both ceiling fans and heaters so it doesn't matter what the weather is like.\n\nWhen we came for dinner, the menu featured six soups and salads combined (priced at $6-9 each), 15 tacos (most $4-5 each; the lobster taco was $8), and 33 tapas or small plates (most $6-16 each). This place has a Mexican slant to it, obviously with the tacos, but in several of the tapas as well.\n\nHere's what the two of us tried (five tapas and one dessert, no tacos):\n\n* Barbacoa Sope ($7) - thick housemade tortilla, black bean puree, barbacoa, queso fresco, pickled red onions, radish, cilantro-lime crema, micro cilantro\n* Lemongrass Mussels ($12) - lemongrass broth, chorizo, garlic toast\n* Carne Asada ($10) - char-grilled skirt steak, Cholula-fried onions, balsamic reduction\n* Seared Scallops ($16) - sweet corn puree, cilantro pesto, crispy serrano ham\n* Octopus ($14) - seared octopus, Mexican white bean salad, cascabel chili-cream sauce\n* Tres Leches Cake ($6)\n\nThe dishes ran the gamut from great to terrible. I hate to use the word terrible, but the lemongrass mussels were so bad, we sent them back. Despite the varying tastes, all of the dishes were presented beautifully. Many were vibrant and colorful. If only some of them tasted as good as they looked.\n\nFirst, the great: Seared Scallops and Tres Leches Cake. Three nicely-seared scallops were served on the scallop plate with two thin, delicate, and extra crispy slices of serrano ham separating them. The scallops were fresh and luscious, flavorful, each piece with a nice bit of char. The sweet corn puree helped to complete the dish. It consisted of black beans too so it made the dish more filling.\n\nThe tres leches cake was excellent. I highly recommend it. Nice and spongy; sweet, smooth, and creamy. Very moist. It's one of the best tres leches cakes I've had in recent memory.\n\nSecond, the good: Barbacoa Sope and Carne Asada. The barbacoa sope was the best-looking dish of the bunch. I like how they neatly arranged the radish slices. The barbacoa was well-marinated and full of flavor. Good stuff. The tortilla was thick and appetizing. We ordered the carne asada medium rare and the meat came out just right. The skirt was succulent and relatively juicy. I liked the crispy fried onions which provided a welcome contrasting texture.\n\nThird, the disappointing: Octopus. We love octopus, but this octopus was simply too rubbery and chewy. By nature, octopus already has this sort of texture, but it was either something about this particular octopus or the way that it was cooked to cause it come out very tough. That and there wasn't a whole lot of it. There was a lot of beans though, but all we wanted was some good octopus.\n\nFinally, the terrible: Lemongrass Mussels. I was looking forward to this dish because I really like mussels in a delicious broth. The broth was indeed delicious, but the mussels were poor quality. They tasted bad. Bad as in they were repugnant and should've have been served. Definitely a bad or \"expired\" batch. We rarely send back dishes, but had to on this one.\n\nOur server was Alvaro and he did a fine job. He knows how to sell Bar.bacoa's dishes.",

The queso was incredible and super cheesy. The quesadilla was full of barbacoa and extremely flavorful because of it. The taco was incredible with a large piece of fried fish and baja sauce. The empanadas were good but spicy as could be to my personal tastes. We also had a spicy margarita and were impressed with how good it was.\n\nThe service: We had a good server that was attentive, but there was a bit of a language barrier.

I must give a special shout out to James who made our drinks at the bar his drinks were on point he even made a special request drink from me & added a twist that was absolutely delicious. I was surprised that they had St Germain when I inquired about it. James even went downstairs just to get it for me. He mixed it with Avion tequila, lime juice & an orange peel. Try it if you've never had it.\nThe food was so good my bf & I shared several nice sized tapas and nothing disappointed. It felt like I was back at my favorite restaurant Noche. I will definitely be returning very soon.",

        "text": "I had the opportunity to finally make it back here post-covid last night.    Prior to the pandemic , this place had earned a spot in my rotation for good wholesome food and drink at good prices in a friendly atmosphere.   I was happy to finally make it back here again.\n\nThis space used to be Noche when I first moved to Atlanta.  It was known for super casual inexpensive fare, and drinks. It was OK, but super cheap.   I am happy to report that bar.bacoa continues this casual atmosphere, but with a better quality food and drink product.     The operators who I have spoked with a few times, take pride in a bringing a unique Latin American spin on Tapas fare.  To their credit, they applied this format before others have since made this adjustment to appeal to a wider swath of consumers (think Mercado).\n\nBefore I move to the food, I will start with the bar and the drinks.  Their drinks here are brisk!  They make great margaritas, and often have drink specials.  I am a Herradura drinker when I drink Tequila, so I was happy in speaking to Scott, one of the owners, that this establishment serves up an assortment of quality Herradura drinks.    I also like the two European raised Columbian Bartender partners who often work behind the bar.  Local Vihi residents have explained to me that both men have been stalwarts in the community for a long time.   Both have been very accommodating when I come for drinks and tapas at the bar.   There is a cool Korean run Columbian place in KTown in L.A. I am at often at called Escala with a similar hip, casual vibe.\n\nNow to the food.  The service is always genuine and fairly prompt at the tables.  My go tos for food are The Skirt Steak, The Beef Potato Empanadas, The Fried Chicken with Ancho Sauce, Grouper Tacos, Lamb Tacos, and Mushrooms.   I have not tried any of their deserts as I'm often quite full.  \n\nAs Atlanta continues to add more and more \"fancy\" scaled, chain restaurants it nice to see a place with character doing well and holding its own.    I like what they are doing here and enjoy supporting them.",

All of the food was amazing and came out at the same time. The carnitas were tender and juicy. The flavor was spectacular! The goat cheese fritters came with a sweet jelly that upped the flavor palate. Calamari was fried perfect. The meat balls were spicy but not too spicy. They came with some toast points which was a great addition. \n\nIf you're ever in the Virginia Highlands area, check out this wonderful neighborhood spot!",

The bartender was very friendly and attentive and the service bar side was very pleasant. The restaurant has a laid back neighborhood feel with a cool after work vibe . We started with house margarita and a vodka flavored cocktail that had a delicious strawberry purée. The drinks were fresh and fairly pricey, very refreshing . We opted for the skillet queso, carne asada, Mexican street corn, and albondigas. All of the meals were delicious our favorites however were the carne asada and the street corn. The steak was cooked to perfection with a crispy sear and warm pink juicy center. The corn was sweet, salty, and packed with great flavor. Street parking is available but beware of peak times because spaces are limited .",

A friend suggested Bar-Bacoa and it does not disappoint! \n\nFood: The Chile Rubbed BBQ Salmon is AMAZING! Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and served over a delicious bed of creamy grits. It's definitely my favorite of all the dishes that we tried. The Mexican corn is good. It could stand to be a little more tart. The patatas bravas are good (of course you can never go wrong with potatoes.)\nThis was also one of the best Sangrias that I've had in a while. \n\nGreat service! Casual atmosphere. There's parking along the street in the neighborhood. \n\nOverall: Definitely give Bar-Bacoa a shot! I can't wait to go back for the nachos and the brisket Mac n cheese taco.",

        "text": "I took my friend to Bar.bacoa for a girls dinner date & we found out it was Taco Tuesday! Meaning 50% off all tacos (except for lobster) which was so clutch!! We literally wanted to try so many and we did haha. I ordered the lamb barbacoa, grilled shrimp and trailer park (fries chicken, house queso, lettuce and pico de gallo). The grilled shrimp was my favorite for sure! I think it's because I liked the combo of ingredients the most (roasted corn,chipotle aoli, and black bean salsa). I kinda had higher expectations for the lamb barbacoa, it was okay just not as good as I thought it would be. The trailer park is the best seller per the waitress and I can see how, it's like a classic can't go wrong with it. \n\nWe also ordered a side of Mexican corn and Spanish potatoes. The Mexican corn was really good! I would definitely recommend. The potatoes had an interesting vinegar like taste so we weren't really a fan of them. \n\nFor drinks we ordered the Steve The Pirate and the House Margarita of the night which was infused with a raspberry flavored beer from a brewery in Asheville. I really liked the margarita I had it! It tasted very citrusy and fresh. My friends drink Steve the Pirate was sooo strong! It was like I had taken shot and I only had a sip. The hazelnut was very apparent in it as well and she really liked her drink. \n\nLastly we had churros for desert and they were really yummy! And because this was Taco Tuesday the whole meal was such a deal! Without the drinks our meal was only $28.00 and $48.00 for everything! The restaurant jyseld is very beautiful and really spacious. We were seated out on the heated patio which was really comfortable despite the fact Atlanta decided to drop back down to 40 degrees this week! Our waitress was also really sweet too. We really liked her. She provided excellent service and made sure to check on us often.\n\nI know I'll definitely be back because there's more tacos I want to try :)\n\nUPDATE: \n\nI love Taco Tuesday!! Came back to try more. This time I got the special of the night which was the Salmon and tried the grilled chicken, along with the grilled shrimp again. Everything was delicious!! The salmon was covered in a honey chipotle glaze, with chopped red onions and pineapple pieces! It was delicious!!",

        "text": "Me and my friend came here after walking the beltline and getting a sudden craving for tacos.(really not that sudden we're in love with tacos) After a quick Yelp search this popped up is being close which is great because I've been wanting to try it. And it was the perfect time to do so because we were able to just walk to the location instead of driving because parking in the area is not easy. \n\nWe just grabbed a seat at the bar, although there was plenty of seating available at that time. The staff was very attentive and the service was quick. We ordered our drinks and received them in minutes. We both agreed those were delish and they had cute names based on movies. We both grabbed the brisket and Mac and cheese taco, the brisket was tasty but the Mac and cheese was just ok. I think it would've been better with baked Mac or just queso. I enjoyed the lamb barbacoa taco my friend enjoyed her Baja taco. We overheard another patron discuss her love for the skillet queso so then we ordered it and agreed it was very delicious. Definitely will visit again.",

They have limited seating so I recommend a booking but if you pop in last minute, like we usually do, they have a few tables in the breezeway and bar seating is open (first come, first serve). If you are a party of more than two, definitely make a booking.\n\nYou really cannot go wrong with their drink menu, my favorite is the pineapple express and I have also had their margarita, both are delicious. We actually went here last night for dinner because I was craving the pineapple express drink, yes, it's that good!\n\nFood is all excellent. Their salsa and guacamole are on point, queso is served in a skillet. My boyfriend has a dairy allergy so I only get the queso when I go with a friend LOL! Other tapas highlights are the goat cheese fritters and scallops. I usually fill up on a few of those items but save room for the brisket with mac n cheese taco... oh my goodness it is decadent!",

I didn't at all dislike my experience with a co-worker, but I just didn't think that Bar-Bacoa's actual tacos competed with others you can get in the area. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nYou've got abundant seating and solid service at Bar-Bacoa, and even on an active Thursday night my coworker and I had no issues getting in and around. Star. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nI will say that Bar-Bacoa definitely wavers on the expensive side. These tacos aren't huge, they're not necessarily packed with fillings as you can see in the pictures, and yet they run for between $4.00 and $5.00, which wasn't unreasonable but was a bit surprising. Star. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nI just honestly didn't think these were anything special. Standard tortillas, pretty standard fillings, and no salsas or peripherals of the like that really left an impact. Single Star. \n\nStar 5: Would you be excited to go back?\n\nBar-Bacoa is good, but not what I could categorize as great. No Star.",

I do recommend making a reservation as COVID has made seating limited. We came at 6:30 and they had a table ready for us at least 6 feet from any others. The staff were wearing masks and gloves and we felt super safe and taken care of.\n\nThe drinks were super yummy, highly recommend the Risky Business for something sweeter and seasonal, and the Stay Classy for something refreshing. The ambiance was also nice with good music and dim lighting (date night vibes).\n\nEverything we ate was 10/10!!!! I wasn't expecting the portions to be so generous. We definitely over ordered and over ate! My favorite was the Chile rubbed bbq salmon. Not sure what was better, the grits underneath or the salmon!! The chicken Tinga taco was also delish. We had the impossible, cauliflower and Baja tacos (both 10/10) and patatas bravas and street corn.\n\nWe will be coming back :)",
