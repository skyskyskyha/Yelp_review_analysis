        "text": "If you're a meat-and-potatoes kind of person with a preference for hearty portions, this likely isn't your kind of restaurant.    If you relish intricate pairings of ingredients with unfamiliar names... welcome to Lazy Betty, a one-of-a-kind experience.  I love it!\n\nPortions are small, but the work that goes into each is awesome (a word I don't use lightly.)  Each of the seven courses, along with the amuse bouche is brought to the table and described in exacting detail.\n\nLazy Betty -- with owner/chefs from Le Bernardin in NYC -- is a splurge.  The prix fixe is currently $195, inclusive of a 20% gratuity.  The wine list is extensive with most selections in the triple digits.  Since I like-what-I-like and I'm no connoisseur, I save money and usually bring my own.  The corkage fee is now $50 with a two bottle per table, maximum.\n\nIf you're intrigued in looking at posted photos, pull up the restaurant's website and read the description of each dish.  The menu, which changes periodically, reflects the season.  \n\nService is impeccable; friendly, not stuffy.  Dress:   While I wouldn't wear ripped jeans, I guess you could.  But don't.  (I don't think it's respectful to other diners or the chef.)  Lazy Betty's ambience is sedate, the room dark and cozy with cushions and blankets on the banquettes.\n\nIn summation:  go, enjoy, try things you haven't eaten before -- and strike this up as a fun evening out.",

        "text": "I would actually consider visiting Atlanta just to eat here again. I feel like that's pretty high praise but it was an awesome meal and one i enjoyed more than most Michelin star restaurants I've gone to.\n\nI will add though that I did not think the Wagyu course was worth the additional money. It was okay but definitely not the best steak i've had. I would skip this especially given the high price tag. Maybe this makes it a little less than five stars but the whole experience was still good enough for me to round up. To be clear, the meal wasn't perfect for the other courses either but the overall experience was great. Really great service, not stuffy, loved the hip hop they played, and good pacing. The food is only one factor in a meal like this and for me the total experience was wonderful.\n\nSome of my highlights were the sunchoke pasta (a bit salty but lovely mix of flavors) and the duck. As mentioned previously, the food was good but not perfect. Felt like a lot of the courses could have used better balance. But it was still a really good meal despite all that.\n\nSomewhere between four and five stars but I round up because it was a really nice experience. Service was excellent as it should be at a place like that. And I loved how unpretentious it all was.",

        "text": "TL/DR: Incredible food, amazing cocktails, fantastic service; expect to spend a lot!\n\nWe had our anniversary dinner on Sunday, 6/25/23, at 6:30 pm. It was raining and someone came out to the car with an umbrella! Fred was our waiter and he was incredible, as was everyone else who took care of us. The restaurant is rustic chic, but not too uppity. You could dress down as far as jeans and a nice top.\n\nWe did the 7 course tasting menu for Spring 2023, which was $195 per person. We chose to do cocktails instead of the wine pairing and I'm so glad we did because the cocktails were so unique! Fred did a really great job of selling the wine pairing though--I was tempted, but the cocktails sounded too good to pass up! We got four cocktails: Northern Lights ($19), Big Trouble ($25), Tomato Fight ($22), and Beet It ($20). Tomato Fight was my favorite--so different and with a kick to it!! The only one I wouldn't get again would be Beet It because, as advertised, it was pretty beet-y. But the rest were great!\n\nAlmost all of the food was incredible. Our favorite was the Foie Gras and Strawberry Terrine, Rhubarb,\nHoney-Poached Strawberries, Sicilian Pistachio, Basil. The only dish I wasn't impressed with was the Roasted Monkfish, Tomato Nage, Persian Lime, Piperade, Calabrian Chili, Demi-Sec Tomatoes. It just didn't have that much flavor. We opted for the Truffle Risotto ($55 extra) and it was fantastic. Can't go wrong with truffle!\n\nThis was a great experience for a special occasion! I'm so glad we got to try Lazy Betty once. Highly recommend!",

        "text": "Been wanting to try this place for the longest time and had the opportunity to spend our one year wedding anniversary there last weekend. It's located in a brick building right on Dekalb Ave. It's all about the ambiance as soon as you walk in - it's giving sexy, upscale vibes. Upon checking in, we walked past the kitchen and what I'm assuming is the chef's counter to our table. The restaurant isn't big and had maybe 20ish tables inside. \n\nOne thing to note about this place is their excellent service. Our glasses were never empty and every time we got up the table to use the restroom, the servers would replace our napkins with a new one - I thought this was a super nice touch and they are very super attentive to detail. The plating for each dish was on point. Every dish came out and was served beautifully. We had the 7 course menu for $195 per person and this does not include the wine pairing which is $135 per person. \n\nWe were first served with biscuits and I love biscuits, but I thought these  were too buttery for me (I know, I know). The biscuits were laminated and perfectly flaky. It was served with a side of butter, which I did not need. We were then served a plate of 4 mini samples (forgot what they were but my personal favorite was the cucumber one). \n\nHere is my opinion for every dish served: \nDay boat scallop crude - didn't know you could eat scallop raw but how this was prepared was well done. It had the perfect saltiness. It was served in a bowl meant for you to drink the sauce but I found the sauce too oily so I opted not to do that.\n\nFoie gras and strawberry terrine - I don't typically eat foie gras but this was perfectly creamy and paired very well with the strawberry terrine. I loved the crunch from the pistachio as a balance to the soft textures \n\nDelta asparagus - my favorite dish of the night! I still dream about this dish to this day. \n\nSunchoke tortellini - pasta was nice and chewy but my favorite from this dish is the delicious uni\n\nPoached fish - this was a nice piece of fish and by this course, I was getting very full. I loved the herbed mousse line served with the fish\n\nDuck - I wish my piece was cooked a bit more. I found the skin a bit too chewy. The confit tartlet was too salty for my liking as well\n\nThe final amuse was a mango sorbet (sooo good y'all) and a mezcal granata. The blueberry sorbet was to die for and was nice smooth with a hint of tartness. The petit fours was also delicious and was the perfect ending to a fabulous meal.",

        "text": "Definitely a rare occasion to have such an incredible dinner and tasting menu. Portions are a good size but I definitely recommend the 7 course menu so you can really have the full experience. Everything was really good but I highly recommend adding the truffle risotto if you like truffle / risotto. It was an expensive addition but it was also our favorite dish. More than the food though, we loved the entire experience. We sat at the bar (chefs table essentially) you can watch the chefs plating and I don't know how they do this so calmly and seamlessly compared to other restaurants. The bartenders were also so great and friendly - the cocktails they've created- incredible. Hands down some of the best crafted cocktails ever. We tried the lunar eclipse and the lemon pepper wet and man oh man, we drank every last sip. Every staff member worked together so well to serve everyone at once. It was truly a lovely dinner. Lovely space and cozy ambiance. Highly recommend!",

        "text": "I brought my partner here for his birthday and we both got the regular tasting menu with no supplementary courses. \n\nAs with any tasting menu, there were some courses we liked and some we didn't. The amuse bouche was one of the best I've had, and the parmesan asparagus, sunchoke tortellini, and crispy duck were all spectacular (and I don't typically care for sunchoke,) but the foie gras mousse was inedible for both myself and my partner. \n\nIn our past experiences with fine dining, the restaurant will often replace a course we really don't like for something off the vegetarian menu, or will otherwise do something to rectify it. This wasn't the case at Lazy Betty, but also isn't a requirement for a restaurant so much as a courtesy. \n\nCocktails were excellent, as was their rotating seasonal mocktail. As a whole, Lazy Betty is a good pick for a special occasion, but doesn't quite compare to other fine dining in Atlanta like Atlas or Bacchanalia.",

All of the staff were knowledgeable about the food with great descriptions of what we were about to eat. The food was beautiful and very unique. It was like eating art. We had added on the truffle risotto to our tasting which was creamy and decadent. The kitchen staff were kind enough to split it for us so we didn't have to hover over one plate. \n\nWe also loved the buttery biscuit as our bread course and the light coconut foam prior to our dessert. \n\nIt was an expensive meal but quite worth the experience.",

I gravitate towards what I like and stick to those things, and I also tend to be really indecisive when ordering. So this was the perfect place for me - a carefully curated meal, very few decisions to make, and an ideal way to push my food boundaries. Unless you're accustomed to eating sumo wrestler quantities, I can assure you that you will be full at the end of this meal without having to do the add-ons. The pacing of the meal was perfect and there must have been like 5-8 servers milling about and tending to our every need. The ambiance was perfect for a date night. Some folks were dressed more casually than others, but everyone looked sharp. \n\nSome bites were better than others and I can't say that anything that I ate was the best thing in the entire world, but the sum of the whole experience is five stars. As other reviewers have mentioned, there's an attention to detail and a passion in every aspect that you simply don't find anywhere else. The price per person also includes gratuity, which makes it a much better value. We would definitely come back and would recommend to others who really care about food.",

After discovering Chef Ron Hsu on the Netflix cooking competition \"Final Table\" - that show was GREAT, can anyone tell me why they haven't done another season?! - I became really curious and decided to give his restaurant a try.\n\nSeven courses of delicious food and perfectly-paired wine later, I was very glad I'd gone. From the first hello to the final goodbye, I was treated like a VIP and fed like a Queen. Already looking forward to my next visit, and Lazy Betty will always be on my list of Special Occasion restaurants in Atlanta.",

I'd like to send a special thanks to our server (I'm so sorry i forgot her name but hard to keep everything straight after 7 courses each with its own generous wine pairing), Gracie our sommelier, and John the general manager.

Tables are not too close to each other and seating is comfortable. \n\nService. Lucia (i hope i spelled her name correctly) was one of the best servers ever. She was so warm and kind and accommodating. The perfect balance of allowing us to enjoy our meal while being attentive. Literally every single person we interacted with was so friendly. \n\nWe did the seven course regular tasting menu without any drinks or any add ons. The presentation on each course was immaculate and regimented. The food was delicious and fresh. There was a sunchoke tortellini with caviar and uni in a creme fraiche that was to die for. The perfect amount of decadence and the nuttiness of the caviar and the sunchoke balanced so well with the creaminess of the uni and the crème. I was so sad when i finished those three bites. My least favorite of the courses was the duck only because i felt it was the blandest of the dishes and a bit tough in texture compared to how i have had duck at other restaurants. Every other course was delicious and the attention to detail superb. \n\nI am looking forward to dining at lazy Betty again and again.  While i thoroughly enjoyed my meal and thus did not feel too guilty about paying $200 for the experience, this is still a steep price to pay in my opinion, even if the food is as good as it was when I ate here. This is especially true when considering and comparing to Michelin starred restaurants that are just as good or better in New York and DC and across Europe for a considerably cheaper price point",

I had no idea what to expect but it was hands down the best meal experience I've had. The waitress was so amazing as we were a larger group than normal for this place (as it is a small, unassuming place), and helped us explain the full history of each dish, and the wine pairing that went with it and why. As each course came out, it felt impossible that you could taste something better than the last, but it somehow continued to get better and better. (I still dream about the scallop and the veal tenderloin courses). We finished off with espresso martinis with our final dessert course - the server suggested to try it with Mezcal, which I'd never considered before but it was an amazing upgrade to one of my favorite cocktails. I think each person at the table was left speechless after this meal. We couldn't have asked for a better send off for our friends to leave Atlanta with a bang!",

        "text": "Respect: it is a simple characteristic of life, that we all should aspire to have for one another. Lack of it results in mistreatment and negativity where the basic fabric of humanity becomes torn. That is ultimately where Lazy Betty restaurant failed, most specifically Shannon the manager, but the details of that are something we shall explore a bit later.\n\nTo start, the establishment is very much an embodiment of Inman Park and East Atlanta culture. It is plentiful with quirkiness, industrial conversion into something new and creativity. After all, converting something that I'd guess to be a car repair garage or a warehouse into one of Atlanta's top incoming restaurants is not something that happens every day. With Ron Tsu at the helm, known by many as the chef from The Final Table on Netflix, the restaurant is one of very few tasting menu options in Atlanta, charging $150 for a 6 course tasting. If there was a Michelin guide in town, it would probably aspire to have a single star.\n\nInitiating the meal with a beer before the food, there is only a single beer option and it is in a can rather than draft: Classic City Lager. That is fairly understandable as the restaurant is not focused by any means to be a place known for beer. The sad part however was that the beer was brought out in an English pub glass that would be found at a dive bar rather than a restaurant with a $150 tasting menu and caviar. Later turned out even the wine glasses are cheap glass, not crystal. But fine, we are here for the food, not the glasses.\n\nAmuse buche with curry chicken cigar, citrus cured salmon and mushroom stuffed eclair like shell, was pretty standard in taste. It was presented nicely, especially with the fishbone shaped cracker, but all three components of the dish were very basic and unexciting, lacking any innovation aside from presentation itself. The biscuit was so drenched in butter, that it was literally leaking all over the table and almost landing on clothes. Although nothing with this much butter could be bad, it was just a very poorly planned dish to eat with your hands. Continuing into other dishes, it was largely more of the same. Good basics, repetition of garnishes and presentation from course to course, but nothing inventive. There was an exception, agnolotti was a very creative dish with a special presentation, with a mussel based purée that really brought it all together into something memorable. The dessert was also quite basic, just a white chocolate mousse crusted with a thin layer of dark chocolate. Passion fruit marmalade was extremely sweet and lacked acidity. But, there was a dish that changed it all, and of course, it was the one with the feathers.\n\nJokes aside, the feathers were not there of course, but the chicken main course was so overwhelmingly oversalted, that after one bite, both of us at the table asked to return it and noted that no replacement was needed. However, it turned out that the issue was not with salt at all, but rather with the attitude of the manager Shannon. Upon getting the check and noticing that the uneaten chicken was not subtracted from the menu, I politely asked our kind waiter Christian if that could be removed. He went back, but the check was brought back by a manager Shannon, who handed it to me and pretended that no request to remove the chicken was made prior, likely hoping I would forget or not notice. This alone started to feel deceptive. I inquired again, to which she replied that they cannot remove a dish that I did not like and that the waiter offered a replacement. I clarified that the waiter did not offer a replacement, but I myself told him that no replacement was necessary. She began arguing otherwise to which I asked if she could bring our waiter over to explain. I also inquired why as a basic principle of service, the dish would not be removed, as it was not just a matter of me not liking it, but the fact that it was overfilled with salt to an extent that made it completely inedible. She kept refusing to remove it and after a few moments, she responds to me saying in a blunt, condescending tone, \"You know what, this meal is on the house\" and turns around to go take it off. Never did I ask to remove a $150x2 tasting menu and a $110 bottle of wine, especially in a tone that is unapologetic and clearly indicative of me not wanting to pay for the meal. The direct ask was simply to not be charged for uneaten over-salted chicken, which represents one out of six courses.  The indirect ask that any logical manager should understand is simply for an apology, understanding and respect.\n\nNeither ask was met, so I went back, asked to pay the full bill and closed it, paying for the chicken alongside to avoid accepting a disrespectful handout. In the end the disappointing food, cheap glassware/silverware and a wine list where most bottles are priced at 4 to 5 times retail also would not have helped the experience, but would certainly not result in such a review.",

Chef driven menu, inventive cocktails and delicious ingredients. We tried their oyster bar, a variety of handmade drinks, salmon bites, fluffy shrimp underneath a whipped potato foam. They are the kind of restaurant that delivers a dining experience that you likely cannot replicate in your own home. Yes you pay for it. Yes it is a special occasion. But if you have not been, put it on your bucket list.",

Also each dish was so exquisitely presented that they looked like works of art. \n\nThere are a few menu options to choose from, and we went with the 8 course tasting menu with the wine pairing, so that we could try a bit of everything that the chef had to offer. So glad that we did, as the sampling of food was perfect and the selection of wines fun and very different from typical wine selections. \n\nDefinitely will return if ever in the Atlanta area again.

Everything was good. \nParking was easy in the private lot but we got there at 6p on a Saturday and when we left, it was crowded \n\nPrice $140/pp, truffle risotto course +$35, drinks about $18-22/each \n\nPrice includes tips but you can leave extra\n\nCourses included (not in order because memory lol..see menu pic for actual descriptions \nAmuse course, which had tuna tartare (soooo fresh & tasty), mushroom puff pastry (one of my favorite bites!!) & Duck curry egg roll. All of these were absolutely delicious \nBiscuit with tart cherry butter. Yummmmmm. Probably the best biscuit of my life. Flaky, croissant ish made with lots of love aka butter \nBeet salad which had just lots going on in the plate. I forgot half the items but it was so good \nAgnolotti pasta dish with mussel cream foam, which was delicious \nShrimp course had whipped potatoes, chili oil, avocado mousse, shrimp on bottom. This was prob my favorite. The textures went so well together & flavors perfectly complemented each other. Potatoes whipped so good you could see the air as you lifted the spoon. Insane. \nTrout course, crispy outside, soft inside with trout roe & potatoes (so cute!)\nChicken dish which had a filling under the skin & damn I could've sworn it was duck. Savory, and maybe my second favorite course!! \nTruffle risotto course was so good! Definitely worth the add on. Super truffle & perfectly creamy. \nDessert was \"black forest inspired\" with dark chocolate ganache shell with white chocolate mousse & cherry filling ... This was a tie for first. It was so bright & wonderful. The citrus powder was a perfect complement as well. \nEnded with petit fours & they were all delicious! I forgot what they were but I think one was longan berry jellied candy.  But they wrote happy anniversary for us and it was so sweet! \n\nThe whole experience was entirely worth it & super creative & wonderful. Janice was our server & she was great but everyone that came by was so friendly! \n\nThis place is worth a trip!",

Since it was a rainy day, we dropped off a few people at the door before parking. There was a man at the door who walked out to the car with umbrella in hand to cover us from the rain. \n\nWe opted for the 4 course meal and ordered the caviar service, oysters, and scallop puff pastry add-on. Food was fantastic. \n\nSomeone in our party wasn't feeling well (for reasons unrelated to the food), so we asked if it was possible to stop service and pay a la carte for first course that already came out and stop remaining service. Our waiter spoke with the chef and communicated to us that the chef did not want to charge us for it, which took us by surprise. The gesture and concern was much appreciated.",

        "text": "Was overall disappointed by the flat, lackluster food. And I was frozen inside the building.\n\nFood: 1 star\nWhile I'm grateful they had a vegan option for each of the tasting menu courses, nothing I had was a dish I would have been happy ordering at a restaurant, let alone did any of them \"wow\" me. I can't say any of them were distasteful -- just nothing that made them tasty. One course (a tart of some kind) was nice, and it was the best of them all. For the price and for the setup (and compared to competitors) I expect so much more.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't get a menu (the vegan options are not listed on any menu), so I'm not sure what I was eating! It was difficult to hear the waiters in the loud restaurant and with masks (glad they were wearing masks!), and by the time we moved on to the next course I had forgotten the description of the one prior.\n\nService: 3 stars\nWait staff was definitely friendly and kind. The restaurant likely needs more staffing as the service was very slow. Arrived at 545 and left around 830pm.\n\nWhen asked after the meal how it was I said it was \"okay\" and I guess that was heard how it was meant because they took $70 off of my meal! I felt a bit guilty as if I complained about the food even though I ate it, but I simply answered the question I was asked. Additionally, none of the staff asked how we enjoyed any course until taking away our plates after dessert (not that I would have complained -- just stating there was no time earlier in the evening that I was asked for feedback). \n\nAmbiance: 3 stars\nCute, cozy environment. Modern, gentrified decor (garage door, brick wall, modern lights, etc.).\n\nNot sure why they have blankets hanging on the chairs -- I don't trust them to be sanitary (like, are they washed between every customer?? I'm pretty sure people were seated at our table after we left and the same blankets were still there...)! It's also just a bit odd to be seated at a restaurant and have a blanket on you..\n\nIt was FREEZING in the restaurant. I believe I was in direct line of an a/c vent. I was an ice cube the entire 2.87 hours I was inside the establishment. I mentioned this to our first waitress earlier on, and she said she asked for the heat to be turned on. It got better for a bit, but as I finally started to thaw out about halfway through the meal, I noticed a quick change back to cold (I'm assuming they turned the air back on as more patrons came into the restaurant).\n\nPro tip: Go to Southern Belle if you want a tasting menu experience you will enjoy!",

Commentary like this allows for us to hear what guests have to say, as well to \"unpack\" those \"comments\" to change what we are doing to better the experiences for future guests.\n\nI do want to apologize for some of the notes you mentioned regarding your experience - namely the temperature and the lack of a menu.  The temperature in that older building (that you noted) is a challenge to keep a good temperature.  What compounds that is Pastry production which have very specific temperature that generally are in the \"warm\" ranges.  I am sorry that you were not comfortable with the temperature even though it appeared we made efforts for you.\n\nI do appreciate your commentary about our staff, however we could have done a better job in explaining to you that at Lazy Betty for a 6 course experience (not including Amuse, Petit Fours, or bread) is a 2 hour and 30 minute experience, on average.\n\nAs well, it looks like were had identified that you didn't enjoy one of your courses and proceeded to proactively comp that dish for you.  However from your notes we should have spoken to you about this instead of not having your be charged for it!\n\nI do want to say that we take your commentary about the blankets seriously, and we do clean our blankets regularly.  We apologize that having a blanket on the chairs was an odd addition for you.  It was only intended to make guests feel more welcomed and also provide a guest an additional layer if they choose.\n\nRachel, It appears that even though we made efforts on our side you just didnt enjoy us, which is extremely sad, however it happens.  If you could please email me at carl.gilbert@lazybettyatl.com with your reservation details (Name, Date, time) I would appreciate it so that I can refund you money.\n\nAnd we also love Southern Belle, Chef Joey, and his team.  That is an excellent suggestion!",

My husband and I did the 8 course meal.  I joked with him before the meal to be ready to eat some chicken nuggets at home because we will probably go home hungry.  I was completely wrong.  I was full even with the small tasting portion sizes.  I decided to go into the meal with an open mind and put aside my \"I don't do dairy\", \"I don't like mustard', etc.  I'm so glad I did.  The chefs were amazing.  Each bite had the perfect flavor, mouth feel, and overall taste.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  Yes its expensive but so well worth it!",

When you're going out for a really nice dinner you want to see attention to detail and everything down the placement of powders and garnishes was consistent and excellent. The duck in particular was stunning and so very rich. Splurge for the caviar if you can- a half ounce will be enough for two.",

        "text": "Disappointed and would not recommend.\n\nTHE GOOD: The presentation was 10/10. The food was plated impeccably and was truly a work of art. The trout was phenomenal and the smoky sauce accompanying it was perfection. That's where the compliments end. \n\nTHE BAD:  Other than the fish, the rest of the dishes were lackluster. One was just about inedible. Portion sizes were smaller than those on a standard six-course menu. Flavors were lacking and the dinner left us feeling disappointed and still hungry. \n\nTHE UGLY:  Our server. Constant upselling is something I expect at Applebee's, not Lazy Betty. Every time the server came by they pressured us to add on more courses or supplements. We politely declined but they kept at it three or four more times. The pushiness continued to the point it became uncomfortable. If it wasn't upselling on food, it was upselling on drinks.  The speed of service was lacking as well. There were long periods of time waiting between courses. Our server disappeared for long stretches of time. \n\nIf this is the food and level of service they provide, they need to lower the price, and diners' expectations. If they want to charge this much for dinner, the flavors and service need to be drastically improved upon. Ambience needs an upgrade too. The area around the bar is 10/10 but that side area in the dining room is 2/10. The tables on that side face the garage door and the busy kitchen door.",

        "text": "Definitely a Michelin worthy experience. We came here to celebrate a birthday and it was amazing. Service was spot on and the food was excellent. The prix fixe menu was not only upscale but also delicious, without feeling snooty (if that makes sense). \n\nI ordered the Busy Betty cocktail to start, which was very herby to me. From the celery oil to the truffle... it was definitely very different. The gin and elderflower were familiar and balanced the cocktail nicely.\n\nNot every dish was perfect, and that was ok. For some reason, the protein dishes were not as mind-blowing as the amuse, the veg and the pastas. Everything was plated beautifully and the flavors and texture were everything and more. One of my favorite dishes was the Tortellini, which you could add on a truffle supplement for $20 more. I also really liked the causa, although it was a little heavy. But as a side, I can definitely see the appeal. The highlights of the evening were the amuse bouche - from the salmon creme fraiche on squid ink chip with dill to the biscuit with roasted plum butter, they were the perfect transitions between dishes.\n\nI would love to come back again, even during these COVID times. I wasn't a big fan of having to order the take out option to set up the plating yourself (I'm not a chef like that and that's why I'm paying someone to do it for me!!!) but can't wait for the opportunity to try a new seasonal menu at Lazy Betty.",

The wine pairings were odd--I can't say that any were very memorable.\n\nThe staff was unfailingly polite and friendly. Service was good, but intrusive. We'd just be getting into conversation when someone would show up with new glassware/wine and the description about it, and then 5min later, someone would show up with the food and another (long) description. It would have been smoother to combine the wine and food and explain why they were paired together--and also allow conversation to flow more naturally.\n\nWhile the food was good, there wasn't much of it. There were 7 courses with about 3 bites each and a few amuse bouches. We both left hungry...and tipsy. My favorite was the truffle risotto--not special, but SO good!--however, there was only about 2tbsp of actual risotto.\n\nWe did the tasting menu (I think that's all you can do?) with wine pairing and the bill was about $400/person. For context, we had a similar meal at Umi with more food, more varied flavors between courses and the cost was $250/person.\n\nIt's a cool place, but I wouldn't return unless someone else was footing the bill.",

I have to say a few of the courses were very good - the ravioli and the soup just dreamy. One of courses was a crumbled nut and what seemed like garnish. Presentation was beautiful. It seems to me they are striving for Michelin star menu and trying to showcase their techniques. The owner Ron Hsu was on the FINAL TABLE a TV culinary competition show on Netflix. \n \n\n***COST (OUT OF 4$) $$$$($). Really really expensive for what you're getting. Our meal for the 4 of us came to $600.  And, I was still hungry after. \n\n\n***DÉCOR: looks almost too casual to be fine dining. Sort of a disconnect.\n\n\n***SERVICE: attentive and professional. Not overly friendly. Good service, our glasses were always filled without being intrusive. That's the mark of great service when you don't notice them but they are there when you need something\n\n\n***RECOMMEND: RECOMMEND for the experience.",

        "text": "Lazy Betty is a relatively new fine dining restaurant that opened February 2019 in Candler Park. The restaurant is named after Betty Hsu, chef/co-owner Ron Hsu's mother. The Hsu family has been successful Atlanta restaurateurs for decades.\n\nThe restaurant is located inside an old brick building shared with other businesses. It looks like a small office complex. The entrance to the restaurant is underneath a blue sign that says \"Rush Center.\" During my Sunday afternoon visit, parking was plentiful and free.\n\nLazy Betty is a prix fixe tasting menu restaurant along the lines of popular Atlanta establishment Bacchanalia. Before restaurant dining rooms were closed due to COVID-19, Lazy Betty was offering two fixed-price multi-course menus: (1) the \"Lazy Betty Tasting Menu\" priced at $125 plus $80 for wine pairings and (2) the \"Chef's Tasting Menu\" priced at $165 plus $100 for wine pairings.\n\nMy fiancee and I were both hoping to dine-in at the restaurant for my birthday on April 1st. However, after COVID-19 really started taking hold in America in early March, Lazy Betty announced on Instagram on March 17th that they were closed until further notice. On April 9th, they announced they were open for takeout.\n\nGeorgia governor Brian Kemp allowed restaurants statewide to resume dine-in service, under new restrictions, on April 27th. However, when I visited Lazy Betty less than two weeks ago, the restaurant's dining room was still, understandably, closed.\n\nWe've ordered a lot of takeout from restaurants in Atlanta during the current pandemic and it's interesting to see how each restaurant has adapted to the takeout model, especially a place like Lazy Betty which had to change from exclusively sit-down service. Given the tasting menu prices, it came as no surprise to me when Lazy Betty became our most expensive takeout meal yet. The food here isn't cheap. At least when you dine in, presentation, service, interaction with staff, and ambiance are part of the experience. Unfortunately, you don't get that with takeout. I empathize with the staff and hope they can resume sit-down service soon.\n\nHere's what I ended up going with for my fiancee and me:\n\n* Braised short rib, smoked tomato polenta, broccolini chimichurri ($81 for two)\n* Eggplant \"steak,\" herbed cauliflower \"couscous,\" pomegranate sauce ($38 for two)\n* Charred broccolini ($9)\n* 6\" cake roulade, vanilla panna cotta, apple buttercream ($20)\n\nI ordered online from Lazy Betty's website (https://www.lazybettyatl.com/) and my order was ready promptly at my pick-up time. Chef Ron, in mask, opened the lobby door for me and we did a contactless exchange. The bag of food was heavy. I could tell from the weight the portion sizes were generous. There was enough food to make five individual hearty meals.\n\nI have to admit I couldn't justify spending $29 on a takeout watermelon salad for two, though I don't doubt the top-notch ingredient quality and craftsmanship. In lieu of salad, I still wanted vegetables and something substantial, so the veggie entree (eggplant) was the ideal choice. The eggplant \"steak\" was fantastic as was the rest of the food. High-quality stuff.\n\nLazy Betty is the first restaurant I've ordered takeout from where some assembly was required. The entrees were served in foil pans that looked more like catering than takeout. On my drive home from the restaurant, I received an email from Lazy Betty Wine Director Carl Gilbert with a PDF containing detailed descriptions of some of the dishes I'd just ordered. The PDF also included plating guides and reheating instructions for the food. I thought that was cool. Our friends who've ordered takeout from Alinea (Chicago) described similar experiences (instructions included with meal). In contrast, Atlanta restaurants such as Little Bear and Wonderkid have figured out creative ways to \"plate\" their food in presentable ready-to-eat fashion using takeout containers.\n\nOur short rib was cooked to perfection. Amazing flavor and texture; a nice balance of lean and fatty. The meat was tender, fall-off-the-bone. In fact, when my fiancee tried to plate one of the ribs, she had to make sure the meat didn't fall off the bone during the plating process. The short rib came from Snake River Farms. Excellent quality. We loved the beefsteak tomato polenta. It was wonderfully smoky. Also, I really enjoyed the sides of broccolini, not only because they were appetizingly crunchy, but also because the chimichurri was phenomenal. I couldn't stop tasting it.\n\n\"Steak\" was the best way to describe the eggplant. Each piece was thick and gratifying. Again, outstanding in terms of flavors and texture. The eggplant came with curried pumpkin seeds which were absolutely delicious. The cauliflower \"couscous\" was great as well.\n\nAll that said, the cake roulade was actually our favorite item. It was incredible. Again, the flavors, the textures... Wow. I love vanilla, panna cotta, and buttercream (and sprinkles) and this dessert combined all of that.",
