Everyone seemed to like their meals. I really enjoyed the chile relleno-- although it was enormous, be prepared. I really enjoyed the corn and mushrooms; it was delicious and I didn't miss the meat.  A few people got fajitas and seemed to like them. My husband said his tacos al carbon were quite good. And the one-year-old was a big fan of the beans. They had a good variety of drinks, margarita and otherwise. \n\nGood food in a trendy area. I can see why it's popular.",

        "text": "Superica will always be my go-to Tex-Mex. They have excellent decor, comfy chairs at the bar and tables, fantastic service, and phenomenal drinks and food. \n\nThroughout COVID, we ordered to-go food from here when we could as we wanted to make sure it stayed around. Orders were always correct, but you can always use more chips. \n\nCome by yourself and pull up at the bar or reserve the back room for a large party. We had a friend's birthday party in the large room, and it was lovely. \n\nWhen you sit down, someone will place their perfectly salted crispy chips, Verde salsa, and chili salsa; not sure of their real names, but that's what I call them. I prefer the chili and my hubby the Verde, which works out perfectly. Then we order queso and drinks. I always have at least one of their margaritas or the Paloma and sometimes switch it up with one of their other cocktails. My hubby is a vodka gin guy, so the bartender sometimes puts a spin on one of their cocktails. \n\nAs for food, there are so many delicious options that I always have difficulty deciding. I love their nachos. The nachos are eight individual chips loaded with cheese and then baked. They put the fixings in the center of the plate so you can make lots of perfect bites. If I want more food, I usually get the shrimp fajitas (not on the menu, but they will make it). The fajitas are yummy in my tummy. I love crafting my perfect bits, which is why I order them over tacos. \n\nI love this place!",

        "text": "Wow. I wanted so much to like this place. First off, the pros: \n\nrestaurant has a nice and pleasant vibe. \nThe hostess and our server were friendly. \nThe complimentary tomatillo salsa was good. \nMy husband enjoyed the pork belly tacos. \n\nThat's pretty much where it ends. \n\nThe cons:\nOur drinks took 25 minutes to get to our table, and when they arrived mine was terrible. Basically, a \"Bloody Mary\" that was an $11 glass of flavorless tomato juice and looked pitiful to boot. One slice of jalapeño on top and that's it. Didn't have the slightest hint of vodka. \n\nThe complimentary dark green salsa verde was smoky but it was so over salty we couldn't eat it. \n\nWe ordered guacamole which was good, but they serve very thick chips (different than what comes with the salsa) and they were cold, yet dripping in grease. \n\nMy food was just like eating a plate of gringo trash that was also so very salty it was inedible. Probably some of the worst \"Mexican\" food I've ever had the displeasure to be served. It was a big mushy plate of slop. The taco that came with it poured grease down my hand and forearm when I picked it up. Totally gross. \n\nThe waitress was very apologetic and took the food away. \n\nThe kitchen staff tried to make up for the terrible meal by sending out a pancake. The pancake unfortunately was very dense, heavy and dry as a bone. The home made syrup that came with it was delicious though. \n\nEpic fails all the way around. I will say the restaurant did remove the charge for my food and the Bloody Mary. I will not go back, nor will I ever recommend this place. \n\nPatria Cocina over at the Beacon Atlanta is so much more authentic, bright and fresh.",

You will never go wrong with Superica. Again, I'm not a big chain kind of guy, but somehow they manage to keep consistency across all of their restaurants and still source from ingredients. I spoke with the wait staff and they noted they try their best to make most of their sauces and ingredients in-house. You just gotta love a place like this.",

The servers wear masks so that helps me feel a bit safer during these crazy times! \n\nI love getting pork when I get Mexican/Tex Mex food so I got the Tacos Al Carbon with Crispy Pork Belly. The pork was good and crispy but I think it needed more of the guava glaze. I got to choose the type of bean I wanted on the side so I got refried. My husband ordered the Mesquite Grilled Quail and it comes with pork tamales. All of the food was great! Also the two salsas that come with the complimentary chips are nice and slightly spicy.\n\nSuperica also has a nice assortment margaritas and mixed drinks. I loved the Matador, which I picked because I like pineapple! The cilantro was more subtle than I thought it was going to be but still tasted lovely!",

For my entree i chose the steak tacos with a side of black beans. The steak was nice and tender and their salsa verde was the perfect addition to my tacos. Overall it was a good experience the only downside is that they are a bit pricey for tacos. My meal was $29 for the steak tacos.",

(It is a chain, which made me even more wary about it to be honest, but I was very pleased with the food and overall ambience.)\n\nMy friend and I showed up as soon as they opened on Saturday morning (10am) and it was very quiet! It started getting busy around noon. The outdoor patio is very spacious and has a lovely vibe with the decor, furniture, and even the design of the patio floor underfoot. We love a place that offers free chips and salsa - our server informed us that because they don't own a freezer, the salsa and everything else is made fresh daily with ingredients brought in each day! The tomatillo/verde salsa was my favorite, albeit a bit salty, and the other one has a smoky flavor with a bit of heat at the end.\n\nI didn't try any of the drinks so I can't speak to those, but the food was so tasty. We loved the huevos mexicanos (yummy even without the tortillas tbh) and chilaquiles, but the hot cakes were OUT OF THIS WORLD. If you're going to try anything here, it has to be the hot cakes. I saw a foodie TikTok recommend those to me which is why this place ended up on my foodie list in the first place, and now I can see why. They were SO tasty!! Not your typical pancake - they were deliciously buttery, not too sweet, and cake-like in consistency, especially with the syrup (which also gives honey vibes). They melt in your mouth!! Definitely a foodie experience worth having.\n\nOverall, the food was great, the service was excellent, and the vibes were on point! One of my favorite brunch experiences in Atlanta, hands-down.",

        "text": "Superica is SUPER!!!\n \nI have come to the Krog Street Market area for quite some time and have seen this restaurant but have never dined there.  I'm glad I did because they are really delicious!  I ordered the Camarones Brochetas and loved every bite.  The Chile spiced gulf shrimp was stuffed with Monterey Jack cheese and wrapped with bacon was really tasty.  My only complaint is that the bacon was too salty, which overpowered the dish.  To break up that salty taste a nice maple bacon would really help blend the flavors of this dish nicely.  You already have the spice/savory flavor with the Chile spice so a little sweet would take this dish to the next level.  \n\nAs for my drink, I ordered the Matador margarita.  It's a very refreshing drink with pineapple, lime, and a cilantro which adds a nice kick.   I enjoyed it so much that I ordered a couple.  \n\nAs for my dining experience, I appreciated the observance of social distancing and they gave us the option to dine outside.  It was still warm outside so we chose to sit on the patio.  The staff all wore masks, were super friendly, and made sure to handle our food and drinks with extra care.  This is a place that I can see myself frequenting because it's in a bustling location with delicious cuisine!",

We sat at the table on side of the bar and it still felt like we were at the bar because the service was just as attentive! \n\nThe food:\nI came here for the food since they have Tex mex nachos, meaning they bake the ingredients on the tortilla chips! This is literally the only place I could find in Atlanta that does this. Just a note, the beef fajita nachos come medium rare, so if that not your preference ask for your temperature when you order.The chicken and shrimp fajitas... soooooooooooooo goood! lol even the Mexican butter that comes with the chicken :) I cannotwait to come back! Definitely sitting in the bar area for my guys!",

I came here on a Sunday with some friends to celebrate finishing part of my dissertation. There was a 45 minute wait to be seated but that's not bad because we were able to use the time to go get a beer in the market. I ordered the O.G. Which is their house margarita as well as the enchiladas de pollo con mole. I love the food here so you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. We also had some queso with chips as an appetizer. Their queso is better quality than most Mexican restaurants so I definitely recommend it! The Dos Equis on draft is also a must try. \n\nParking: it can be a bit tricky to park depending on the day you want to eat there. Weekdays are probably easier than weekends as far as parking goes. There is a free lot for Krog Street customers that you can use as long as you don't leave the Krog Street area. This fills up pretty quick but there are some paid spots nearby as an alternative.\n\nI would definitely recommend you try this spot and the rest of Krog Street market if you are visiting Atlanta!",

There was a green creamora sauce that added some heat and a side of pivot and lettuce filled in the taco. Great hot sauce too.

        "text": "I would say this business model of a wait list is okay but not having a phone number to call and find out if they are open or not is terrible.  Our experience -- our daughter had picked the Krog St location to go out to dinner with her friends with her parents for her birthday.   Parents land there early to put the group of 7 on the wait list while the young ones come closer to seating time.   Got to the restaurant and there was no one seated or waiting post 5pm.  Finally someone comes and tell us the whole place was closed to outsiders that evening for a private party.  Can you please learn how to post a message to that effect on your social media and web channels!!! It was already 5:15pm when that happened and we had to scramble to find another restaurant that could either give us a reservation for 7 on a Saturday evening in downtown or midtown Atlanta (like that is going to happen) or pray for a miracle... a miracle did happen and that will be in my review for Atrium at Ponce Market,, because they went above and beyond to accommodate us! \n\nMy recommendation to those wanting to visit Superica for a special event -- please don't!",

Everyone ordered at the table and the waitress thought my daughter and I would eat off the same plate. Everyone's food came out. I had to wait another 20 minutes for my food. We had to place plates inside of our booth because she didn't come get the dirty plates.So I didn't get a chance to even eat because everyone was down with their food. We had to repeatedly remind the waitress and ask for things. This was a very disappointing experience from one of my favorite. Also, the waitress got everyone's card but but the bill on one card!",

I usually get the queso with chorizo and while I wait for that to come out I'm chowing down on the chips and green salsa. That green salsa is Bae and will have you visiting this place twice in once week. Lol! \nNow, I tried the barbacoa tacos. And the meat was real good but honestly, Superica, y'all need to cook them taco shells a bit. Like they taste fresh out the pack. Them tortillas are still tortilla-ing if you know what I mean,!I'm just being honest. Y'all would have some bomb tacos if y'all just tweaked that little detail. I heard next time I should get the chicken Quesadillas, that they were very good. That was actually from a bartender that works here. This place is perfect for a casual date day or night. And in my opinion you should sit at the bar. The layout of the rest of the restaurant is very family oriented in my opinion. Overall good food, good drinks, good ambiance and friendly and accommodating staff. You should go!",

I came here on a Sunday with some friends and we were told that the wait time would be about 45 minutes to an hour. This wasn't a problem since there's so much to do in the area. We walked right around the corner and had drinks at Hop City. Right as we were finishing up, we got a text that our table was ready. \n\nWe headed over and received great service the whole evening from everyone. I can't remember the exact menu name of what I ordered, but it was a chicken and steak fajita with bacon wrapped shrimp. The meal was soooo delicious and seasoned well. We also shared the queso appetizer which was also good! In addition to the great food, we received wonderful service from our waitress. Overall the atmosphere was nice, the food was great, and the service was excellent. I'd definitely recommend checking out this location!",
