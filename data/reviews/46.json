        "text": "Dinner with the wife and mother in law a couple of days before Christmas. For a chain Thai restaurant, this was damn good. \n\nStarted with the coconut milk soup with chicken and love it. This soup was excellent - a bit spicy but far from overwhelming and chock full of flavor. \n\nFor my entree, I went with the minced chicken chef speciality. While the dish was great, there was entirely too much soy. If we were out west, we'd be in trouble because there isn't enough water left in the Colorado river to hydrate me after this dinner. Still, it was very good. \n\nMy biggest complaint and I almost took another star away for it is the 20% auto grat for 3 people. How obnoxious can you get?  I understand auto gratuities for large parties or maybe busy nights  was unbelievably obnoxious. Service was great but for 3 people?  And 20% is obnoxious. When did we get to a point that 20% ceased to be for outstanding service and is now somehow a minimum?  It is your responsibility as a business owner to pay your employees a decent wage, but if their pay is based on gratuities than the tip is going to match the level of service. I have no problem tipping but hitting me with an automatic 20% instead of simply paying your employees more is robbery. \n\nAn auto-gratuity should be a minimum that I can add to if I want.  It should never be at the level for excellent service and not on a party of 3 people. As much as I enjoyed this meal, that policy will keep me from coming back.",

They have always loved it! \n\nThe drink list does differ from their other location. I learned this the hard way.

The appetizers sampler is a must, I believe you can select 3 apps! The Sweet Chili Wings and The Crab & Cheese rolls are my fave. Also, if you see the 5hour braised short rib on the menu....ORDER IT! You can get it in a noodle dish but my fave is served with  yellow curry and eggplant with a side of steamed rice! I've been to all of the locations but the one on Juniper is my new fave!

I need to start off with parking - finding somewhere to park is a pain here. Maybe it was just because it was mother's day (I'm not from Atlanta) but it was difficult. I eventually found a spot in the lot near the restaurant and it can get expensive especially if you are at the restaurant for a while. \n\nOn to the service - the hostess was kind and immediately sat my boyfriend and I at a table outside where my pup just laid on the floor. Our waitress was sub-par. She would take a while to get back to us yet was more attentive to the 2 men sitting near us. We did not want to keep paying for more parking time due to her lack of attention as we had already been there for a while and the restaurant wasn't very busy since we having a fairly early dinner. \n\nThe food was delicious though. It was a mothers day menu and I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp and Chicken Pad See Ew and the boyfriend got the Beef Drunken Noodles. They were great portions and I had leftovers to take with me. The calamari was hot and yummy! My photo for calamari was taken after I ate half of it so there's quite a good bit that they give. They were decently priced for what you get and the ingredients seemed to be great quality. Overall, I would come back and hopefully get someone else as a waiter who would be more attentive.",

        "text": "Cozy place and very friendly staffs. We have about an hour to dine before heading to the symphony. Not super hungry but needed something good . We got 4 appetizers, 1 main , 2 old fashioned and 2 soft drinks. For appetizers- chicken satay, Thai dumplings, Roti Curry and street style grilled pork. For the main my hub and I split surf and turf panang. All in all everything taste good but nothing blew our mind.  Fried Lobster in panang wasn't that great very hard and chewy...way too cooked. Our waiter was awesome though . He took note that we have time limit , so the food and drinks  came out very quickly. Our bill  has 18% gratuity already added which I was surprised since we are a small group of 2 adults and 2 kids. So with tax and gratuity the total is $300 ish. Yup..",

        "text": "My first time at 26 Thai Kitchen & Bar will likely be my last. My experience was a complete letdown from beginning to end. My husband and I were invited to a birthday dinner and when I tell you our experience was subpar from beginning to end, it is NOT an understatement.\n\nMy gripe begins with parking. When we pulled up to the restaurant, we saw that there was a lot next door. It seemed full. I called the host to inquire about parking and she couldn't provide much insight other than, \"there's a lot next door.\" There is no valet (which there should be for more sufficient parking) and there were several spots that could have been used for parking if the restaurant had a functioning valet system, but I digress. We found parking a couple of blocks away.\n\nWhen we arrived, there were two hosts. Instead of one of them showing us to our party, the host informed us of where the dinner was. Nice. We sat down and our waiter, Joe walked in, realized the entire party still wasn't seated, and walked back out. I would have liked to order a drink at 8 months pregnant, but he left before we could even beckon for him to come over.\n\nOn to the food...we ordered the Exclusive 26 Thai Platter deluxe, which included the Soft-shell Crab with sweet Thai chili sauce, Sai Oua which was pork sausage with red onion, fresh ginger, sticky rice, and peanuts, and Street- Style (grilled) Pork. Out of the three, the Street-Style Pork was THE BEST, followed by the Sai Oua. The Soft-shell Crab rendition was not good. It tasted like it hadn't been properly cleaned, to be quite honest. Try at your own discretion.\n\nSince I'm 8 months pregnant, I inquired about the mocktails. While our waiter didn't have any suggestions, I requested something \"fruity.\" I'm not sure what was in it. It was good but it was better when I poured my sparkling water into it. The drink was very syrupy, however, it seemed like all the drinks were mainly syrup infused. The drinks are not made with fresh ingredients, so if you don't like sugary cocktails, I would stick to wine or a neat drink.\n\nFor mains, we ordered the Sea Scallops and See Klong Moo (BBQ pork spare ribs). The Sea Scallops were battered, which was a new take on scallops for me and had the 26 Thai sweet chili signature sauce with battered eggplant and green beans and sticky rice. To me, this dish seemed more like an appetizer. The sweet chili sauce becomes a bit overwhelming after the third scallop. Also, if I had known that the entire meal would be battered, I wouldn't have ordered it. The See Klong Moo however, was delicious. The ribs were cooked to perfection and were fall off the bone GOOD!\n\nThe evening proceeded with Joe acting seemingly annoyed with our party, for whatever reason. People were already seated when we arrived, so I'm not sure if he was annoyed that everyone wasn't there all at once or if he was taking his bad day out on us, but he did everything from disgruntledly removing dishes from our table to not putting the cake back in the box for us (even though he wrapped everything else for us.) Dear Joe, I apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused you on Saturday night. In the future, please let guests know if you're having a bad day. We know restaurants are understaffed and employees feel overworked, I promise compassion goes a long way and we would have understood.\n\nI wish I'd had a better experience, but between the food and the service, I just have to say the experience was not good and I wouldn't recommend it to friends or family.",

My favorite was the Exclusive 26 Thai Platter Deluxe appetizer that came with 3 dishes to share -- all 3 of them were so delicious. The 5 Hour Short Rib was my boyfriend's favorite, he was impressed that it was so tender and flavorful! \nThe desserts also really blew us away. Both the 26 Spring Roll and Thai Tea Creme Brulee were so unique and amazing.

        "text": "Food was great! However, it did come out pretty quick though. (As if pre-made) The only disappointment was the actual service from bartender coming over to service tables as well. The gratuity of 18% for a party of one was epic and undeserved. At arrival it seemed like she was attempting to pressure some of the higher priced entree's and drinks on me. As whatever she could do to up the gratuity. Me being completely unaware of, I still noticed her mediocre service and lack of care to help. Obviously she knew the tip was already included so it seemed no need to bother and provide great service. Noticing her be so busy doing nothing at the bar was unthoughtful. As many times I was assisted by other waitresses (in the seating area) to get help with things I needed. I honestly left there feeling very glad I didn't order any add-ons.",

        "text": "So this is a place I can absolutely see myself becoming a regular at. The food, the drinks, the vibe, give it all to me. \n\nLet's get into it!\n\nLocation and Parking\n\nThey have multiple locations throughout the city. I have been to the midtown location as well as the Brookhaven location. The Brookhaven location is located in the Town Brookhaven Plaza, a super convenient plaza that boasts a Costco, Publix, LA Fitness, and a few other really good retail shops and eateries. There is free parking all around, it can get crowded so make sure you grab a spot as soon as you see one. \n\nAt the midtown location there is a lot a few doors down that is paid valet on Friday and Saturday, but it is also shared with a few of the other restaurants that are on the same strip, Babs and Sivas.  There is also a paid lot located behind the restaurant on Peachtree Street. It can easily get crowded in either of these lots so Uber might be a good option to consider.\n\nReservations, Venue, and Atmosphere\n\nI did not have a reservation at either location I went to, but they do take reservations so depending on when you plan on coming I would suggest calling ahead. Even though they are the same restaurant the venues gave completely different styles and vibes, which I absolutely loved. The Brookhaven location had a bohemian style vibe, the decor was vibrant but still very true to the Thai style. There is booth, and table seating as well as seating at the sushi and regular bar. They also have a nice sized patio that I will definitely be sitting on this summer. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable.\n\nThe Midtown location is located on Juniper street, a few doors away from Sivas lounge. The decor here is a stark contrast from Brookhaven, but it is still absolutely beautiful. It is more dimly lit, giving a nice date and city vibe. The walls are painted in dark greens as well as whites, and they also have table and booth seating. There is also an upstairs area, and they have patio seating in front which gives you a great street view. \n\nFood and drinks\n\nI had the old fashioned at the Brookhaven location, and it was so good I also tried it at the Midtown location. Both times a clear win. \n\nFor appetizers we I tried something different each time. At the Brookhaven location I had the roti massaman, which comes with roti bread, massaman curry, potato, and carrot. The curry was so flavorful, and the bread was warm and soft. For dinner I had the basil fried rice. It was flavorful with just the right amount of spice. \n\nAt midtown I had the 26 Thai Platter, where you select four appetizers to share. My partner and I got the chicken satay, the street style pork, shrimp rolls, and the crispy dumpling. They each came with their own sauce, but my partner and I dipped them in everything and they were all amazing. The appetizers were filling enough that we didn't even need to order mains. \n\nService\n\nThe service at both location was absolutely amazing. My servers were knowledgeable as well as personable, checked on us often and made great conversation with us. Both our food and drinks came out quickly, I have absolutely no complaints.\n\nVerdict\nI have absolutely enjoyed myself both times that I've come here and I can't wait to go back with friends, or my partner. If you love Thai food and a great atmosphere you should absolutely drop in to either location. You'll be so glad you did. \n\nUntil next time!",

One highlight was the Rama Chicken - chicken was juicy and curry was rich and flavorful, albeit a bit on the sweeter end. My friend commented that the 5 Hour Short Rib was incredible.\n\nWe also tried the Yin Yang dessert - the cake was moist and the coconut ice cream paired well with it.\n\nAlthough most of the dishes were priced on the higher end, our entire party really enjoyed our experience here.",

        "text": "Amazing, amazing, amazing!!! This place has been on my list for a while and I finally got the chance to visit. Me and three of my friends went here for lunch 11/12/2021. There's a parking lot located a few feet past the building on Juniper St for $2.60 for 2-3 hours. Inside and outside seating available. We decide to sit outside since it was a beautiful day. The waiter was super sweet and very helpful, I think her name was Mrs. Emma. \n\nNow on to the food...we took advantage of the 4 small plate for $30. We ordered the crab cheese rolls, dumplings, shrimp in a blanket, and signature wings sweet chili. All were amazing but I have to say that my favorites were the dumplings and crab cheese rolls. \n\nFor our entrees we're ordered vegetable potstickers off the small plate menu, chicken Kao soi, whole red snapper, and the pineapple boat. I personally had the Kao Soi and it was delicious. The snapper had a really fishy smell but tasted good. My friend that had the pineapple boat said that the chicken was hard and had them remake it with shrimp only, but also stated that it was good. \n\nTo be honest, you can go here and eat off the small plate menu and be in heaven or you can order an entree. Either way, you won't be disappointed. \n\nNow one thing I would not recommend is the drinks. They were not strong.",

I've never gotten anything I disliked except maybe this one sausage special Thai dish (see my pics)... that was quite interesting. Would not recommend if you're not used to more ethnic Thai cuisine. \n\nMy favorite was definitely the Kao Soi which is under their \"Thai Favorites\". The crispy noodles soak into the curry sauce and then you can add a fried chicken cutlet on top. The portions are also great for sharing or if you're just getting for yourself, it can feed a small Asian girl for two meals. \n\nThe service has never been a problem for me, parking is a hit or miss along the street, and the inside is quite modern and sleek. There's sometimes a wait here but if you're okay with bar seating, that's much quicker! Otherwise there are always reservations.",

The food was delicous!! I had curry and it was very good. The portion sizing was pretty good, the plates are just big enough to fill you up without being uncomfortable. I will say that this is a little on the expensive side but I think it's worth it.",

I eat here about 2-3x a week. So imagine being in the restaurant and the General Manager turns lights on and begins to kick people out at 10 pm! This is ridiculous! I'm only giving it 2 stars cause the food is consistent. I will never go back here! Check my video below.",
