I'm not a huge coconut fan but you barely taste it in it. I ordered the chicken & waffles which proved to be a solid choice. My friend went for the shrimp & grits and enjoyed it.\n\nHowever, the true star was the French toast - an absolute favorite that I'd recommend without hesitation. 10/10 experience and would definitely go back.",

Each person in our party got something different and everyone enjoyed! We had a reservation and were seated quickly, but there were also other tables available! All of the staff was very attentive. Our server Michael told us jokes while we waited for our food, and it came fast! We had:\n\n* Tiki Salmon\n* Island vegetarian plate \n* sunny vegan place\n* jerk chicken wings\n* virgin + regular rum punch\n* Caribbean ouay\n\nEverything was good, well seasoned, large portions and great prices. Definitely will be back soon, as a Jamaican -- I approve, the music was great, we wanted to dance!",

                "text": "We came to Wylie and Rum to celebrate my husband being done with a 12-day stretch of working at the hospital pharmacy, and we weren't disappointed! It was very easy to get a table - the place was pretty sparsely populated - so we got sat right away. There is a big screen with a projector in the back, so it seems like it would be a fun place to watch a game (or, if you're me, perhaps the Bachelor?) There is indoor and outdoor seating with fun wall art inside and nice potted plants and outdoor heaters outside.\n\nOur server Ruth was fantastic and checked on us often. I love to get spicy margaritas everywhere I go, so tonight I got the spicy guava margarita, and let me tell you, this isn't just spicy - it is SPICY!! Definitely not for the faint of heart, but this is one of my favorite drinks I've ever had.\n\nMy husband got the rum punch, which came in a very cute tiki head glass. I tried a sip of it, and it was deliciously tropical without being overly sweet. For his second drink, he got the Key West lemonade, which he described as \"fine... just okay - but easy to drink.\"\n\nFor an appetizer, we got the queso with plantain chips, which went surprisingly well together. The chips were crispy and the queso was hot, and we got plenty of each for the price.\n\nMy husband got the big ass burrito, which he'd gotten before, and was just as huge and delicious as he remembered. \n\nI got the island burger with a slice of grilled pineapple, and a side of fries. They didn't add my pineapple at first, but as soon as I pointed this out, our server was quick to grab me some juicy pineapple fresh off the grill. Though delicious, this jerk burger may have been even spicier than my drink, so I had to go slow and drink water. The fries are battered and crazy delicious. I can't wait to come back and try even more wonderful Cuban dishes here!",

It was one of the best I've had. \n\nBecause the server thought I had waited longer than I should have on my sandwich and they had run out of the plantain chips he offered me a complementary drink. Unfortunately I was traveling so I asked if I could get an agua fresca instead so he quickly concocted a delicious combination of guava, passion fruit and mango. He also brought me a small glass of fresh pineapple wedges that were perfectly sweet and juicy.\n\nThe black beans & rice that replaced the plantain chips were good but paled in comparison to the Cuban and fruit juice.\n\nService was top notch and he joked that the Caribbean inspired menu stole dishes from pretty much every island.\n\nIf the weather was warmer and you didn't look outside you could easily imagine yourself at a rum bar down in the islands.\n\nDefinitely would recommend this place and be willing to come back on another trip through the area!",

Seated promptly, attentive wait staff, manager stopped by to check on us, clean enough for a sunday night. \n\nThe food was not bad but as someone who really enjoys Cuban, Caribbean, island fare this missed the mark. The Big Ass Burrito was filling and huge. Ibtook about 25% home. The Cuban Sandwich was the best item...ordered it and ate it 2 days later and it was still good. The major L of the night was the Mojo Chicken Plates. Honestly the nerk chicken and mojo chicken taste like the same chicken with a splash of sauce. It's hard to explain. \n\nAll in all, it's not the worst meal I've had but I will not be beating down the door to go again. \n\nThe manager was very receptive to the feedback. This place would be great for a crowd or meet up after kickball, dont feel like cooking weeknight experience. but not a sexy date night vibe. Think casual dining like Fridays but cubanish",

I thought the jerk wings were ok, a bit dry/crisp for me, but the person who actually ordered the wings really  liked them. The portions are a nice size.\n\nThe drink menu will make you feel like you're on the beach... a lot of tropical, Caribbean inspired drinks. I mean, rum is in the name!\n\nAtmosphere: The bright colors, floor to ceiling windows surrounding the restaurant, Caribbean music, and bench seating gives beach vibes. For a second you might forget you're in ATL... until you see all the traffic on Moreland! There's also patio seating. \n\nService: Great\n\nParking: Free parking lot\n\nOverall: Definitely check them out!",

I can remember 5 cent Krystal's in Jacksonville, FL.  \n\nSo watch the extras, a plain burger or cheeseburger, with...mustard for me, grilled onions, mayo, the bun lightly toasted.  \nFries are good, don't recall if they come wit da burger.  \n\nSo stop by this mid sized Jamaican Joint , y'all, specially if you live in R-Town or, yeah Cabbagetown, Edgewood...",

Also tried the jerk chicken sandwich- must try. I only had a bite, but delicious. Great vibe and very cool decor. Plenty of outdoor seating and indoor. \nHighly recommend. I didn't get any food pics but did get a few of the restaurant. I'll try the pineapple upside down bread pudding next time.",

                "text": "My fam & I recently went to Wylie & Rum. They are a Caribbean kitchen and rum bar that serves Cuban Caribbean inspired dishes. Their dishes are definitely flavorful and the drinks are STRONG!\n\nWhat we ordered: \n Chicken & beef empanada (big enough to share w/ a few ppl)\n\nJerk chicken bowl\n\nTiki Salmon\n\n Jerk chicken plate (chicken is huge!)\n\n Mojo chicken plate \n\nRumosa pitcher (had us feeling real good )\n\nAll plates come with yellow rice, plantains, black beans, and street corn so definitely generous with their portion sizes. They actually ran out of rice that day so we got fries which were really good by the way. My meal actually came out after everyone else's and I somehow happened to get rice (forgot to take a pic). I ain't gon lie, I was full by then and we went the day before my trip so I froze it and when I came back 2 weeks later and ate it, it tasted just as fresh as when I ordered it! \n\nAs far as service it was lacking a bit and why I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars. They were actually short staffed and the manager was helping out. In the process of being there our waitress left and another person from the bar picked our table up. We were forgotten about a couple times as we waited for our pitcher for a long time because they forgot to put it in. Once I got my drink though I was fine because I was feeling good lol. It's a pretty chill place and has a relaxing environment. \n\nThe food was really great though and we did enjoy it. Definitely give them a try if you're looking for some flavorful food and good drinks made right!!",

Although the greeting was very energetic and the staff are friendly, and the ambiance was welcoming as well...however the service wasn't the greatest. \n\nWe sat waiting for an appetizer for well over 25 minutes with a moderate crowd. We were completely understanding of the \"new restaurant\" hiccups. But at some point the staff has to realize how long a consumer is sitting without being attended to. I'll update the review once the food is served...but for now they aren't doing the best! \n\nSo update, \n\nThe food was delivered after quite sometime. It was good a few dishes weren't hot, but the manager and other staff took over and tried to make a rebound. I have to be honest and say this will most likely be our last trip, just because of the amount of time it took to get our order compared to other guest who arrived at least 30 minutes after our party sat.",

(I hate to order using an app. If it's that serious have us order at a counter when we come in and be done with it.) \n\nSomeone saw me struggling though and brought me a menu. I ordered a cocktail and the chicken bowl. The cocktail was fine - bit too heavy on the juice and tart. A lot of traditional tiki drinks are tart but this was unbalanced so it really didn't taste that good. The chicken bowl tasted fine but it wasn't flavorful enough to be worth returning for, and the portion size was smaller than expected. \n\nThis review is 3 stars for the good service and the free parking. I would rate the food as 2 stars. \n\nYelp #21 2022",

I've never had \"jerk chicken\" taste this way before.... I feel like they need to stop by Negril village or Tastee Spoon to see how it's supposed to taste. Also, the yellow rice had zero flavor.

The Cuban sandwich is delicious and it comes with a side of rice and beans.  Can't beat the price for this meal. A def must try if you like pork.  \n\nParking: limited but in the parking lot.

                "text": "SO excited to have a great new restaurant in the neighborhood. Cool Caribbean vibe decor, tasty food and rum drinks that match up to the \"real thing\" at many vacation destinations, and such friendly service. \n\nThis is a brand new restaurant on the corner of Wylie and Moreland in Reynoldstown that is sure to be a great anchor in a new-ish strip of businesses walkable from homes in the area. Ample parking if coming from further away. \nWe visited on a Friday night about 1 week into their soft opening and just a day into holding a liquor license. Some of the food and drink options are still pending, but we're looking forward to going back soon. The place was pretty full but not uncomfortably so. Menus and ordering are contactless, and service is pretty quick (I don't recommend ordering entrees until you're close to done with apps). \n\nWe had the rum punch, rum old fashioned, and rum daiquiri - all really tasty, not too too sweet, and the right amount of boozy. The tostones topped with picadillo were really perfect - nice spice and the plantains perfectly crisp but not sliced too thin. The jerk wings are grilled and served with a raspberry sauce. I really enjoyed my Baja chicken bowl, which came on a bed of yellow rice and black beans; the hubs had a 1/2 slab of ribs - very meaty and tasty too. \n\nAll in all - excellent!",

This tasted like someone auntie or uncle was in the back cooking it up the jerk Cesar with plantains was an unexpected delight. I was stuffed and didn't have room for dessert but I will definitely be back to try.",

So hats off to the bartender. \n\nOrdered the Mojo Chicken. I liked the taste of the chicken, Black beans and rice. I was disappointed that the onion and bell pepper medley were overcooked so they didn't compliment the meal. \n\nMy only concern about the restaurant is that I saw three staff members petting dogs, while outside talking to patrons but not coming back into the restaurant and washing their hands. One staff member did have on gloves and when she came back into the restaurant, she took them off. Another server handed me napkins after petting a dog. I discarded them.",

A friend and I stopped by for a weeknight dinner to finally check it out and we were not disappointed. The inside is spacious with plenty of seating and a full bar, with a large patio outside as well. I was pleasantly surprised by the vegetarian options available, and the jackfruit bowls were delicious. We also ordered the loaded tostones, and although the toppings were very similar to what came in the bowl (rice, beans, and protein), the tostones themselves were solid. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the owners stopped by to say hi and were seeking honest feedback. I'm excited to come back and try their cuban sandwich and empanadas, and check out the rum drinks at the bar.",

They worked hard to create a nice, secluded from the street outdoor patio situation. However, Friday night can be interesting as far as the \"locals\" in the area go. Just do a take-out order!\n-Now the service is why it only gets 4's\nWord to the wise...ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE. I think the kitchen gets a bit overwhelmed with the crowds and forgets things. Lol! However, the staff is always nice and super accommodating if something like that happens. Overall, it's a must visit recommendation from me to you! \nYou're welcome",

She happened upon Wylie & Rum and remembered she had been wanting to check it out. The restaurant has an island vibe and puts me in the mind of rolling up on a small roadside cafe when on vacation. The menu is a mix of Caribbean and Cuban cuisine. We landed on the rum punch which was highly recommended but was just ok. As a Jamaican, I was expecting the Appleton rum punch that I'm more familiar with but this wasn't that. The food was much better. We ordered the jerk chicken wings as an appetizer and the mojo chicken bowl and Big Ass burrito as entrees. We really enjoyed the wings and burrito. The burrito is HUGE so the name was appropriate! The staff is very friendly and the restaurant to include the restrooms are clean (clean restrooms are always a plus for me). It's definitely a cute spot on Moreland for Caribbean/Cuban inspired food.",
