        "text": "Forget everything you thought you knew about fried chicken. Mukja isn't just serving up clucking good food; they're orchestrating a symphony of flavor that will have your taste buds in another world.\n\nThe real stars of the show are the chickens, each piece a crispy, golden masterpiece. Gone are the days of greasy, soggy mediocrity. Their double-frying technique creates a shatteringly perfect crust that yields to reveal juicy, tender meat inside. But the magic doesn't stop there. Their selection of sauces is like a flavor explosion in your mouth. The classic soy garlic is a sweet and savory dream, while the spicy marinade sends your taste buds on a thrilling rollercoaster ride.\n\nBut Mukja isn't just about the chicken (although, let's be honest, it could be). Their sides are an ode to Korean culinary delights. Kimchi mac and cheese, is the ideal counterpoint to the richness of the chicken. \n\nAnd let's not forget the service! The staff is as friendly and welcoming. They're happy to answer your questions, guide you through the menu, and ensure your experience is nothing short of delightful.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned Korean food aficionado or a curious newbie, Mukja is a must-try. It's the perfect spot for a casual weeknight dinner, a fun gathering with friends, or even a date night. Just be warned: one bite, and you'll be hooked!",

If it was solely base on their technique and gave a different type of flavors compared to many fried chicken spots. I would've been okay with that, sadly it wasn't. \n\nThe chicken was sadly dry and the mini sides were easily forgettable. \n\nHopefully if we choose this next time around with our company.

It was different yet tasty and a bit on the spicy side. \n\nIf I were a spice girl, this place would definitely be at the top of my list! However, I'm not but I still forged through. The flavors are yummy and a, I would have never thought of this but surprisingly, it works!\n\nThe space coming in was cool too, very modern chic. Unfortunately, on the day that I went the staff there wasn't as helpful. In a place so unique like this,  it is imperative that someone greets you and when you tell them that you've never been here before, give you insight on what's in store and maybe offer suggestions. That didn't happen at all,  it was more so, please know what you want before ordering because I don't have the patience or willingness to assist.\n\nOutside of that (which is a big thing because if anyone has read my reviews we all know that friendly staff is major on my list of feeling like me and my money is appreciated and for whether or not I'll return, share and invite others since I always have family and friends coming into town. \n\nNow although I live about 20 plus minutes away, I still wouldn't mind giving them another try with someone who has a palette for their food combinations. Meaning I'm willing to refer and bring someone else there to give them a chance to\n experience it.\n\nUntil next time, enjoy the food pics below.",

My husband had the bird on a bun and he said it was just ok. I didn't try it. We had the cheesy corn and it wasn't very good. Also the Korean slaw was good but a bit too spicy for my taste but if you like spicy you'll probably love it. The inside is pretty cool with the murals. The soda machine was basically out of all of the drinks my husband and I would have preferred. And just a heads up it's a cashless business. Overall it was just an OK dining experience.",

        "text": "This is a hidden gem in Midtown, let's discuss! \n\nLocation and Parking \nMukja is located in the Metropolis building in Midtown, next to Sweet Hut. They validate parking for 2 hours in the Metropolis deck. \n\nVenue and Atmosphere \nThe decor is sleek, simple, and clean. You order at the counter and wait for your food. They have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine (win!) as well as canned alcoholic beverages. \n\nService \nThe employees were kind, professional, and helpful. Food was served promptly. \n\nFood and Beverages \nMy date and I shared the wings, mac and cheese, tofu rice bowl, and Korean Slaw. I will say the mac and cheese was very creamy and flavorful; it was mixed with kimchi. Restaurant mac and cheese can be hit or miss and this was surprisingly good. The wings were well seasoned and crispy. The Korean slaw is plain and requires sauce; the soy garlic and sweet heat mixed well. The tofu rice ball was also delish; I don't usually eat tofu so I don't have a comparison point for the flavor, but I did enjoy it. My only complaint is that the Freestyle drink machine was missing several flavors... I was craving an Arnold Palmer with peach lemonade lol. \n\nVerdict \nI will certainly be back to try their signature bird on a bun fried chicken sandwich!",

The chicken tenders were very juicy, hot, and crunchy, but the breading lacked flavor. The sweet and spicy sauce was pretty good, but it was a little too sweet in my opinion. I absolutely loved the korean slaw - this was the star of the meal for me. The dressing was like a gochujang mixed with sesame oil, and it was so flavorful. The corn cheese was very disappointing. Pieces of corn were floating in this super salty liquid that did not taste very cheesy at all.",

        "text": "Ah KFC - and I'm not referring to the imposter Colonel Sanders KFC. I'm talking about KFC near and dear to my heart: Korean Fried Chicken. Fun fact: fried chicken was first introduced to Korea when the American military set foot and stationed on Korean soil during the Korean War in the late 1940s. The US troops that were stationed in Korea during Thanksgiving only had chicken instead of turkey to celebrate - and the rest, as they say, is history\n\nIn the case of Mukja (which means \"Let's Eat\" in Korean), two entrepreneurial friends (Peter and Sean) wanted to create a business that stood out while also drawing upon their vast restaurant experience. They decided to put their talents together, one thing led to the next, and ultimately Mukja KFC was born.\n\nThere's something about every KFC joint that hits you slightly different. Maybe its the fact that the chicken is double fried that leads to a delightful crunch- or maybe it's how the chicken is usually tossed in sauces with sweet/spicy/savory notes along with a proprietary secret batter.\n\nBrining the chicken, in my humble opinion, is the missing step at most KFC joints. Thankfully, Mukja, actually leverages the power of a brine for all their chicken before the entire cooking process starts. The result is a wonderful, flavorful, and MOIST piece of chicken for every crunchy bite. \n\nWhile KFC is not the healthiest food choice, make sure you get some exercise in that day to eat everything relatively guilt-free e.g., hit the gym, run around your neighborhood, or twerk upside down (my personal favorite).\n\nMy party ordered the whole bird which had dark/white meat and comes with 4 sides, 2 large specialty sauces, and pickled Korean radish. We decided on the Soy Garlic and Sweet Heat sauces along with the Korean Loaded Fries, the Korean Slaw, Cheese Corn, and the Mac & Chz. Everything was great but my favorite side was definitely the Mac - which used a smoked gouda sauce topped with roasted Kimchi. \n\nIf you're looking for KFC in Atlanta, look no further than Mukja. Kudos to the owners for introducing something different and exciting in the ever-growing Atlanta food scene!",

        "text": "Just tried Mukja . Have to say honestly it's over priced fast food. I got a half bird and it come with 3 sides and one sauce. \nMy chicken must have been a very small bird. Maybe a Quail haha. A lot of the chicken was very dry. My sides were max n cheese, fries and the slaw. The slaw was good. Max n cheese was pretty flavorless and mushy. \nI'm giving it 3 stars because the soy- garlic sauce was great and helped with the dry pieces. They should really toss the chicken in your desired sauce instead of giving it to you on side. $30 for a small chicken and sides for one person is ridiculous.",

Maybe that person was great with camera angles because my food did not come out looking like that and I was underwhelmed by the experience. \n\nI ordered the cheesy corn, which was more like a creamed corn ( and yes I have had Korean cheesy corn several times in different places), the corn was overcooked, and wasn't really that flavorful or tasty. The wings were tiny! I usually go to Yumbii for Korean style wings and I'm so mad at myself that I tried this place out because I finished my food feeling very unsatisfied. They had a nice crunch to them, but they were a little too chewy for my taste.\n\nThe best part was the comeback sauce to be honest. I likely won't be back.",

First off, it was hard picking sides for me. My fault.  Not theres.  I don't like raw onion \n So I decided on the fries and Mac and cheese. The Mac is sold with kimchi on it. I like kimchi but don't love it yet. So I decided against having it put on. I know I could have asked for it on the side, but I didn't think of that. I don't believe it would have helped this Mac and cheese.  Second, the seasoning on the fried chicken was delicious.  So crispy and delicious.  The thing is, you need to cook chicken.  The leg was good until the end and the meat was pink. No way. I pulled the thigh apart.  Same. Pink. That is not a good look for chicken.  Third, the fries were really good. My takeaway,  cook the chicken longer.  I won't get the Mac. I will try this place again though. I want to try the wings. I believe they're whole wings and you get 10. Not bad.",

And I'm not a super picky person (I'd like to think lol).\n\nI went again today after not having been in awhile and was pleasantly surprised. I think they must have revamped their food. There was a huge improvement/change in the main dishes and sides. They weren't just no longer strange tasting - they were delicious.\n\nThe inside is really fun, and outside of the issue I had in the past with the food itself, it's always been a good spot imo.\n\nThey validate parking (you have to park in the garage that is attached to the building that Sweet Hut also uses). If you park in the deck to the left they can't validate that.\n\nWill be back! It's not too busy during the lunch rush",

I didn't understand what was Korean about the fried chicken, the only thing they added was kimchi on top and two buns. The chicken was burnt. The fries were well salted and cooked. The Mac and cheese was creamy, but the flavor tasted like there was bacon in it. It looked like there were some pieces of bacon in the Mac and cheese, I asked the guy several times he said no, this what Gouda cheese looks like. I don't eat bacon so I had to make sure, because it tasted like there was pork flavoring used. I looked at Yelp reviews and they have asked for bacon to be removed before ordering it. I went back to the cashier to ask him again and showed him the pieces of it, he's like that what Gouda cheese rinds. I didn't feel comfortable eating it, so I switched it out for fries. \n\nNot sure if I ordered something wrong but it was avg. I had better places",

        "text": "I'd never heard about Mukja Korean Fried chicken until the YES! event earlier this year.  When I visited to pick up my yes meal, I also decided since I was there that I should pick up dinner, so I ordered myself a 10 piece of their KFC wings to go (14).\n\nThe 10 piece also comes with pickled radish, French fries and sauce of your choice.  So how did I like the food?  Well it's a bit mixed for me.  I'm trying to not bring my experience with the YES meal in this review, but the fried chicken dark were breaded nicely, were crispy and man they hit it out of the park for me.\n\nHere's the thing...the KFC wings were not the best wings i've had.  I think they were over breaded and while they were crispy, it was really hard to eat them without pulling some of the skin off from the grease factor (and that's the main reason for KFC wings is the skin!).  \n\nThe sauces were hit or miss for me as well.  The honey butter was very sweet and tasted exactly like honey and, well, butter.  I didn't have much of this sauce.  The spicy sauce was much less sweet but also not spicy.  To their credit, staff did say they were working on a habanero sauce because they'd heard comments about customers wanting something a bit more spicy.  Kudos to them for that...i'll have to try it the next time I visit.\n\nFrench fries were good.  Crispy, well salted and went well with the dipping sauces.\n\nThe interior of Mukja is really nice, clean and bright.  and there's a good amount of seating/tables for dine in.  Located at the corner of Peachtree st and peachtree pl, you can find Mukja just behind the Taco mac.  Parking was not an issue for me.  I parked at my old apt off of 5th street and just walked there.  But there's several street parking spots that are local to the restaurant as well.\n\nI do want Mukja to succeed so even though I think this experience is a 3.5 I'll round them up to 4 stars. I am certain that i'll go back again just to give them another shot, because like I mentioned earlier, I ordered two separate dishes at the same time (both fried chicken of some sort), and while one was amazing, the other was just heavily breaded and hard to finish.  I hope the next time I visit everything I try will be amazing and I can bump them up a star or two.  I hope you give them a shot if you're nearby!",

        "text": "The real \"KFC\" lives, forget Kentucky, Korean Fried Chicken is the real move. If you've never had Korean fried chicken, you're absolutely missing out and I'm so sad for you. But luckily, there are awesome restaurants like Mukja that are a great option for your first crunchy bite of chicken magic right here in the A.\n\nDespite loving any reason to dress up and enjoy a meal outside of my home, I'm a big delivery-ordering kinda girl since I'm lazy, lol. So when I saw Mukja being featured on an app and highlighting their great reviews, I decided to check them out. What a fabulous choice because, wow. My first couple of orders, I went with their wings, fries and Mac & Cheese (like, same order x 3 lol) and became hooked! The Mac and Cheese topped with Kimchi? FIRE. It's sooo difficult for me to find Mac and Cheese that I like if it isn't made at somebody's aunties house. But Mukja's Mac is so good! The Kimchi topping is a perfect match, *chefs kiss*\n\nAnd the wings? Babyyy. The crunchy skin offers up a crispy first bite before you enjoy the juicy wing as a whole and lose your damn mind. I mean, there's love in that marinade and batter!! And I know that there's been a chicken shortage in the world and some restaurants' wings really show that. Not at Mukja. Each wing has been well-sized and juicy, like they were prepped on a farm just for me *insert teary-eyed emoji here*. Ugh, see, there goes that vegetarian diet I'll never actually make happen. Oh well, more chicken for me!",

        "text": "Overall, interesting experience. The service was great, food came out quickly but the food itself felt overpriced and underwhelming. The menu is very small and options are very limited, so be prepared. We got half of the bird with the side of Korean slaw, Mac and cheese, pickled radish and fries. The bird was good and the Korean slaw was pretty spicy. Fries and Mac and cheese were fine. It felt like the sauce wasn't evenly distributed but rather clumped to the center of the slaw, making an awkward texture. The place has a fast-food style seating and felt very KFC. I wish they had kimchi or something else more traditional but that's my personal preference!",

From my time in Atlanta, this was one, if not is, my favorite Korean Fried Chicken place. \n\nOrdered\n- Whole Bird with Sides (5/5). So tasty! I love the crispiness of the chicken and how big and succulent it is. The sides are on-point too, from the kimchi-infused coleslaw to the southern style mac n' cheese, this is a great value meal for the family \n\nNote: only giving a 4/5 since there was one stance when the chicken was very undercooked and we had to air fry it again\n\nI would go back to this place and try the other dishes like the chicken sandwich. So many good options!",

        "text": "On a quiet street near Sweet Hut is a cute little shop, clean and inviting looking from outside. Mukja Korean Fried Chicken is an amazing add to the ATL area. My husband and I were so excited to try it - and the chicken is halal! \n(Note: Sean, one of the owners at the front counter, clarified that it's the fried chicken pieces right now that are halal - the chicken for the wings and the bird on a bun are not, so best be sure to ask when you come in. There is also bacon in the bowl as well as the Mac and cheese, though you can request for that to be removed in the Mac). \n\n-ambience: the interior is really cute - even though it's a fast casual place, it was really clean and the interior decorations added a nice touch - clearly, enthusiastic about Korean culture and good food. They have some high tops and a few tables with benches for those who would like to dine in, all clean. Even the bathroom was spotless! 5/5\n\n-service: Sean, one of the owners, was our main POC while there and was really awesome and welcoming! He took the time to explain to us all the halal options, the different sauce flavor profiles, and he brought the food to our table and checked in on us to see how everything was. It was amazing service, he really made us feel at home! 5/5\n\n-food: OMG, I am just glad it's a bit of a drive, or else I'd be here daily for dinner! The fried chicken is super fresh, perfectly crispy, and goes really well with the sauces. We got both dark and white meat, and both hit the spot! The fries were really good too, nice and crispy. There were several sauces that we tried - the comeback (thousand island like), the A-T hell (habanero with a hint of sweet) and soy garlic (similar to standard Chinese style sauce). My favorite was the A-T hell! \nThey also provide sides with the meal - the pickled radish and the Korean slaw were delicious, and the Mac and cheese was solid too. 5/5\nThe chicken orders are a little on the small side - my husband and I ordered a half bird, and then we went back to order another quarter, because we were fighting over the last chicken piece and still had room for more. \n\nBest be sure, we will be back. A solid KFC in ATL!! And it's halal - what not to like??",

        "text": "Mukja is dank. Solid addition to Midtown, although a little hidden on a side street next to Taco Mac. Came for a late lunch and had no wait around 3pm; menu is short and straightforward, and we got our food quickly after ordering.\n\nMyself and my two friends ate indoors as it wasn't very busy, and it's a fairly open space in terms of seating. We all got chicken sandwiches; I got it with mac n cheese and my friends got theirs with fries and slaw.\n\nThe chicken is super crispy on the outside and juicy inside; not spicy or anything (I like some heat myself) but very flavorful with the sauce, which is like an upgraded Zaxby's sauce. I like that the sandwich wasn't super heavy, but still filling! The mac n cheese was VERY gouda forward, but that is gouda for me (ha ha). My friend loved her slaw - not the creamy kind, but it was super fresh. Fries were what you would expect; note they are steak cut.\n\nAll in all, good meal for $12 - glad I was able to stop by while back in ATL, and would revisit next time I return!",

        "text": "My husband and I were downtown for an concert and we needed something quick to grab Mukja popped up and we love Korean Fried Chicken. Parking is free around this area for 1 hour or so I believe. This was the most friendly experience ever . We needed help with the menu our first time, the gentleman HELPED SO SO MUCH . His nice attitude was everything! \nWe had 10 wings combo & Half Bird with Beer. I had to try all of their sauces. My favorite Comeback Sauce, my husbands favorite was Korean Sweet one. Food so fresh and crispy loved it. Every time I pass by MidTown I plan on stopping there. \nThank you for giving us a memorable experience and it was an amazing atmosphere. Songs they play to decorations on the wall.\n10/10",

        "text": "Stopped by here for a quick lunch and ordered the 2 pieces of dark meat chicken and I got the Mac n cheese and the coleslaw. The chicken itself was just okay in my opinion and the sauces didn't really add anything other then some saltiness from soy sauce. One of the pieces of chicken actually wasn't fully cooked in the middle which made me not able to finish the whole chicken. Honestly the best thing about this place was the coleslaw. It was so unique and the sauce had gochujang in it I believe which have it a very complex flavor. The Mac n cheese itself was good but want a big fan of the kimchi on top of it. Not really a big kimchi fan so not the best judge of it. I would literally just come back here for the coleslaw that it was that good. Little pricey too for only getting two pieces of fried chicken.",
