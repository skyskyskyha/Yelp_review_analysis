For $13-$15 dollars, I was expecting a pretty hefty sandwich but that wasn't the case. \n\nOverall, I think it's worth coming here for the cafe items as they are different and really good! It also looked like they had unique seasonal drinks which is always a plus. Would I recommend coming here for food? Nah, especially since there's other great options nearby.\n\nCheers!",

The croissant was a bit bready but had delicious topping and cream filling. the sandwich was a bit dry and underfull, and i would probably not purchase again. however, i would certainly go back for the noodles and cafe space.",

I should've known what to expect, but the taste did throw me off. The lemonade was tart, and even when I mixed the matcha and lemonade, it took me quite a bit to get used to. Still good, just took me off guard. They also have coffee menu items, bakery items, and non matcha or coffee items as well. Some menu items allow you to add alcohol in it, which was interesting to me. Service was amazing as well, and staff was super nice about suggesting drinks and informing us on where to sit. \nThe downsides is that there is limited seating. Seeing that it's by multiple college campuses, seating is limited, especially with there being a restaurant as well. But that's pretty much the only downside, so don't let that stop you from trying here even if it's to get a drink and leave!!",

The brown sugar latte was not too sweet but I did expect something much sweeter given how other stores' versions taste. For appetizer, I got the takoyaki which were the perfect size. For my entree I got the Tsukemen, and this was more proof that I am NOT a Tsukemen girly. Finally, I got the cream puff with matcha custard for the dessert. I was dumb and thought it was a matcha-flavored puff that you could add strawberry custard to, but it's really just a regular ol' puff that you add either matcha or strawberry to.\n\nAs always, I love the seating options and that the store is divided into the cafe and restaurant. The servers were so attentive and kept checking on me because I was there for so long. I overheard the manager rally the team to prepare them for potential DragonCon customer rush, which was super awesome as a customer to know that they truly care about their service and wanting to go above and beyond.",

It's a QR ordering system - pretty seamless, but we had a great server that got water and answered our questions. My husband got the Peach Sumo Smash. He loved it (I am not a peach fan)! I was driving so I stuck with water. \n\nWe had just missed brunch (it ends at 2 PM). For our entree, we both got a brothless ramen option. There were quite a few options we were choosing between. I settled on the Stir Fried Mentaiko Noodle which was utter perfection! The poached egg is very lightly poached, mixed with the sauce, this dish was super creamy. I also added some pork which paired wonderfully. My husband got the Sichuan Beef Mazemen. It has a little kick to it but not too spicy. It was good, but I thought mine was better. \n\nOn our way out, we couldn't resist a croissant. We got the Yuzu and cream. A croissant with a creamy/yuzu center - what more can you ask for?! It was AMAZING! I would come back just for that, let alone a delicious meal. They also had a lot of really good coffee options, so I have sooooo many reasons to return. This is my new favorite cafe/ramen spot in ATL!",

                "text": "With the seemingly infinite stream of new casual restaurants popping up in Atlanta and serving quality cuisine, it can be a bit of a challenge to try them all, especially for someone who loves cooking at home and being on the road traveling.\n\nMomonoki comes from the owners of Brush Sushi in Decatur, created by a husband and wife. Momonoki translates as \"Peachtree\" from Japanese, so it's undoubtedly paying tribute to the everything is peachy culture of the town and the street that seemingly connects everything. With a fully digital ordering system enabled with Apple Pay, payment is pretty easy, but there is certainly an argument to be made for and against the concept. I stand firmly within the \"against it\" crowd, preferring human interaction, attention and time away from a cell phone as much as possible during a meal. This forces you to be on the phone. While technology is great, there is a place for such concepts and Mononoki did not feel like that place.\n\nThe crowd here is largely dominated by Georgia Tech students coming in to study or grab a bite to eat. The space is somewhat industrial and there is a patio, which unfortunately is just too close to the interstate and major road to make it pleasant. The edamame here is out of this world, with a wonderful sauce and a perfect level of spice. The chicken katsu sandwich is also pleasant with good bread. Mushroom katsu is good as well. To finish off, a matcha soft serve ice cream is a must. All around, very solid food. I cannot personally say that with exception of Edamame I fell in love anything that would make me go out of my way to return, but I think liking even a couple things on the menu is a great thing as is.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the prices here will undoubtedly add up. Establishment's casual nature is not indicative of a low cost. I just did not feel that anything here was worth coming here to eat again, did not like the digital ordering method forcing you to pick up the phone everytime you want a beer and lastly just the general lack of ambiance. I did not hate it, I did not love it.",

                "text": "When invited by our friends to come out of OTP, we jumped at the chance considering Momonoki had an interesting menu and we needed some outside time. Parking is kind of confusing so of course that's probably the first thing I have to go through.\n\n**PARKING: There is a garage right next to the spot, make sure you don't get it mixed up with one that is further away, the garage is literally right next to the cafe. Momonoki will validate and that will be that.\n\nNow, getting parking out of the way (because going downtown is crazy like that)... When we came in it seemed pretty cramped, but I liked that it was open seating and that they had outdoor heated seating. With the outdoor seating we had plenty of space and there were a lot more tables. \n\nOnto the food: Of course the thing to get here were the sandos. These are Japanese sandwiches, but the bread is fluffier because it's not your normal sliced bread. It's milk bread (well, it should be). The sandwich itself you have the option of what you want as far as protein. The Pork Katsu Curry was great, and I would definitely recommend it. The Cheese Pork Katsu was okay, but if I had to choose I would go with the curry version.\n\nAs my first time and going into the foray of croffles, they were great. It wasn't super sweet, but then I loved that there were all this fresh fruit. The croffle itself was great and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wanted to try out croffles.\n\nOverall, Momonoki isn't bad! I probably won't come here all the time, but for sure it's a place that I can mark off my list as a place I want to try. Come here if you're in the area, not afraid of dealing with traffic, or just want to try something different in your cafe experience.",

The interior is really nice and refreshing and has a lot of space to sit on the first floor.]\n_________________________________________________________\n\nIS IT CLEAN? |\n\n[They do stay pretty clean the majority of the time which is absolutely great! ]\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nFOOD & DRINKS |\n\n[The place was great and easy to order because you had to just order on your phone. I got the Oyster sandwich was delicious and great. And their sweet potato chips were amazing! Probably my favorite. The food was great and fresh to the point, you fill relaxed at the end of your service.]\n_________________________________________________________\n\nSERVICE |\n\n[The staff was very nice and helpful to help you get what you want, and work very efficiently to get all orders done with full care.]\n_________________________________________________________\n\nOVERALL |\n\n[For the quality of the food was great, but the price is a little expensive for a sandwich that was $17 + tip. But the location is in downtown Atlanta, and some places can be expensive there. All in all, though, the food is well worth it if the cost was not an issue!]",

Food was really good. I was skeptical about the dino egg, so I tried some of my friend's. Whatever to the actual egg, but that pork crispy outside I could eat as a standalone! It was so good. I wasn't crazy about the coffee soda, but it's because the fruit flavor clashed with the soda itself. If it was a cream soda it probably would've been amazing. My ramen was great. I added chicken and removed the pork belly, but the other pork was missing. The waiter was quick to give me the side of pork to add. \nIt's also interesting because you order on their site almost as if you're ordering through Doordash. It's somewhat impersonal, but I honestly thought it was great because the service was on it. I think it's a tad pricey, but would still come back!",

The second floor is meant for the cafe, and it has some seating for studying but the wifi cuts in and out. \n\nCost & service:\nTruthfully, the meals are expensive, and the taste is around a 6-7/10. Service is on the slower side as well. It is a great place to go to have dinner with friends if you don't care about the cost, but meals will cost around $20-30. The cafe is worth it if you're a big fan of iced strawberry matcha lattes, but overall Momonoki is just okay.\n\nRatings:\nIced strawberry matcha latte: 9.5/10\nMatcha swirled ice cream: 10/10 (a must try)\nHot matcha latte: 5/10 (grainy, overly strong) \nChicken kara-age bowl: 7.5/10 (very filling, probably my favorite ive had here)\nSeared pork belly bowl: 7/10 (very saucy, also filling)\nRamens: 6.5/10 (mediocre, on the saltier side)\nSalmon bowl: 5.5 (every salty and soupy)",

Ordering is easy and online via table QR codes, so you can add anything or check out at any time during your visit. The servers are friendly and efficient. I've tried almost all the appetizers, but my favorites are the dinosaur egg and shiitake nuggets. The katsu sandwiches are really good, well-portioned lunch. But I almost always get the ramen. I imagine all are great, but you definitely can't go wrong with the Momonoki Tonkotsu or Kakuni Spicy Miso Tonkotsu. \n\nFor coffee, the Okinawa Brown Sugar Latte is great if you have a little bit of a sweet tooth. They also have baked goods which always look so good.",

We liked everything, and the portion sizes were generous. The ramen broths didn't particularly stand out, but were still enjoyable overall. Also, I have to say that our favorite was the taiwanese beers, especially the lychee beer.

                "text": "PARKING: they validate parking for the parking lot immediately adjacent to the restaurant. If you check out their instagram, it shows you pictures of the particular parking garage. (If you turn into 8th Street, it is NOT the yellow parking garage.) parking validation is for two hours. \n\nMomo Cafe: There are two sets of doors. The one to the left is to Momo Cafe, the one to the right is to Momonoki. I think you can use either one. Momo Cafe is tight. There's limited seating upstairs. There's water and cups upstairs as well. \n\nRESTAURANT: \nYou choose a table you want to sit at and on the table, there is a QR code. Scan the QR code, it'll take you to ToastTab. You order your food there. If you want to ask for recommendations or anything (I didn't), I assume you'll have to waive someone down.  I recall seeing six people there (including the guy behind working at the cafe). And you have to tip before you get to see the actual service you'll get. \n\nWe ordered the Steak (Filet Mignon) Sando and Sichuan Beef Mazemen with ramen egg. \n\nI cannot say I'm impressed by the service. I watched our food sit on a table behind the counter as people walked by, I guess, to let our food cool down or because they prefer more to serve the stuffed croissants. However, I prefer my hot food to be served hot.  \n\nThe food finally arrived and I take pictures. That's when I noticed there was something shiny on the sandwich. A piece of plastic. We didn't say anything. Not worth the effort, to be honest, because I was already irritated that our food was just sitting there and the noodles were cool to touch when they were brought to the table. \n\nAnother thing that annoyed me. The menu tells you what's in the Sichuan Beef Mazemen: \"Stir fry beef, sesame peanut sauce, house chili oil, Sichuan pepper, chives, cilantro.\" Pictures showed bean sprouts but since it wasn't on the menu, we assumed bean sprouts are added on. Nope. It's already included. It's probably one-fifth of the dish.  Maybe it's just my misunderstanding of what the menu is telling me, but I wouldn't know that because waiters aren't there to communicate anything to you (ordering system). \n\nI am sure other people can speak to having great experiences and I am sure that this doesn't happen often, so if it's on your bucket list, don't let my experience stop you. Do I recommend this place for the food? Not really. It wasn't amazing or anything. Maybe if the food was warmer, it would've been better, but I wouldn't know and I'm not going to spend another $50 (including tip) to find out. (Recall, I had to tip before I received service.)

I thought this was just a regular restaurant but it's also a cafe. \nI did not realize that Momo Cafe & Momonoki were the same. They are connected and you order your food and drinks through the QR code at the table. It's super convenient. There is a second floor which has very little seating. It was full of students studying. There is also a covered and heated outside area. A lot of college students were here studying or just eating. The overall decor and ambiance were really cute and relaxing. The food is a little expensive, but I think it's worth it if you'll be sitting there for hours studying or socializing. It takes some time to come out, and it did taste very fresh. We ordered the Curry Dip Pork Katsu Sando with a side of sweet potato chips and the Pork Yuzu Shoyu Ramen with extra pork and a boiled egg. We loved the sandwich. It was so light and the curry dip was creamy and delicious. I did not like the sweet potato chips though. The ramen was also really good. It's not the best ever but the pork was very soft and had a nice overall flavor. The matcha cookie and matcha latte were OK.",

                "text": "So...this was a very surprising (shocking?) experience for me.\n\nI've been itching to try this place for a LONG time. I mean, just look at the juicy pics of their foods...and did I mention that I'm a huge fan of Japanese foods??\n\nWELL. For starters...I came in after a trying time in traffic, as well as perplexed with their parking situation. I actually called prior to arriving at the restaurant, to ask about parking. Well, I was told that the parking garage was called \"Modera\" (?). Well, after nearly an hour-long traffic jam to get to this Midtown location (this area is basically a Cluster***k during rush hours), I finally get to this place...only to find a garage right next to the \"Modera\" sign, yet one that's NOT for Momonoki. In fact, this garage required a pre-paid parking ticket. I had to pay 6 bucks for 2 hours (but only after doing so online...their machine wasn't working!). Anyway, turned out that there were TWO parking garages, nearly next to each other...and again, the one located RIGHT next to the \"Modera\" sign was NOT the one. Thanks to the girl on the phone who did NOT specify-clarify this possible confusion, I ended up paying the parking fee (if I parked in the right garage, it would have been free-validated). So that's the initial bummer.\n\nThen once I entered the restaurant, I was told to order electronically via their QR code...through their annoying ordering system. Basically I had to enter every information possible, including typing in my credit card numbers. WHAT a pain...not to mention a possible security risk (public internet area)! \nIt was either this or the alternative of ordering in line...which they seemed somewhat reluctant to do initially (??). I was already in a mood when I entered the restaurant... then THIS?!? \n\nAlso, must mention that this table I initially came upon was so dirty, I was basically cleaning it myself when one of their staff members noticed...and took over. BTW, the whole place just looked rather unkempt and dirty. \n\nAnyway, I couldn't decide, so ordered more foods than I should have. I ordered their Chicken Katsu Sando w/ Veggies, then this \"Dry\" curry dish that intrigued me. I also ordered their Black Sesame Latte. I actually felt somewhat hopeful at this point...having ordered some of what I thought would be \"heavenly\" eats. \n\nSadly, more frustrations and disappointments. First of all, the Black Sesame Latte didn't even look like \"Black Sesame\" Latte...Rather, just a typical Latte w/ a few sprinkles of Sesame...which basically ruined their efforts at cafe art! OMGLOL?? While I liked the presentation of the Dry Curry, the beef had this funky taste...and I just did NOT like it at all. I had maybe had 3 spoonfuls? Good thing I ordered 2 entrees? Well, not that lucky! Not sure if they delivered the wrong order or what, but my Chicken Katsu Sando did NOT look or taste like Chicken Katsu (I ordered Chicken Katsu, but they delivered something else???). If it was Chicken, it sure had a weird taste to it...not the typical Japanese Katsu taste AT ALL. Even the Milk Bread was disappointing ...as it was so thin!! Again, I took maybe 3 few bites, and just gave up. I simply did NOT like ANYTHING I ordered...and that's a true rarity for me.\n\nSo yep, I paid about 42 bucks, including tip (for what, I don't know?)...for foods and drinks that I barely ate. Good thing the items weren't too pricey...but still, what a waste of my time (including traffic time!) and money (including parking!). *SIGH*\n\nI thought this was an authentic Japanese bistro, but the foods just did not taste authentic to me. More than anything, the foods were very oddly flavored...which just tasted \"funky\" (wet, bitter/odd, and just all BLAAAH)! Was this an off day...or are they really this bad?? \n\nI REALLY thought I'd love this place...as I perused over their menu beforehand...but obviously for me, it was ALL a miss. Bad location, confusing parking, convoluted ordering system, dirty tables...and funky foods. \n\nNever again!",

                "text": "Momonoki is a restaurant that sells Japanese inspired dishes. I really like the modern interior design and minimalistic aesthetic. The inside features natural colors such as whites, greens and light wooden browns. There are also a lot of plant decorations, which is a nice touch and adds to the natural aesthetic of the space. The restaurant has its own mini cafe, outdoor seating, as well as a second floor. The second floor makes for a great study spot. A waiter can take your order, or you can scan a QR code and place your order online. Service is great. The waiter was very attentive and always came by to refill my glass when I was running low on water. \n\nI always order the same thing when I come to Momonoki because I finally found something that tastes good and isn't disappointing. I've had a lot of bland items off the menu, one of them being the Momonoki Tonkotsu Ramen. I will never order ramen from Momonoki again because of how lackluster the broth and toppings were. It's definitely not worth the price (minimum $16). Below are my reviews for the items I had: \n\n*Chicken Kara-Age Bowl ($13.00) - The chicken karaage has definitely improved since the last time I visited. Sometimes the chicken is dry, but this time it was flavorful and tender. The karaage is seasoned with some type of spicy powder, which isn't something I remember it having, but I like it and it gives the dish some personality. What hasn't changed is the ratio of rice to toppings. When my friends and I order rice bowls, we are always left with so much rice. I'm not saying that the solution is to give less rice because I love rice, but I wish there were more toppings to go with it instead of eating it by itself. For $13, I'm not expecting 10 pieces of chicken karaage, but at least one more piece would be nice, or at the very least more of the wasabi mayo sauce to coat the rice at the end and make it more tasty. You can add more sauce for $1, but I don't think it's worth it. I think the bowl should come with slightly more sauce to begin with to coat the rice at the end. This bowl feels like it's doing the bare minimum, yet this is also the only thing I enjoy eating when I come here, which I think says a lot about the menu options.\n*Matcha Soft Serve Cup ($6) - Very smooth soft serve. Great matcha flavor; it has a subtle earthy bitterness. I personally wouldn't get this flavor again because it was a bit more bitter than I would've liked, but it was delicious and I recommend it.\n*Strawberry & Cream Soft Serve Cup ($6) - Also very soft and smooth texture. I enjoyed this flavor more than the matcha. It tastes just as you'd expect a strawberry soft serve to taste, sweet and tastes like yummy strawberries. It is also a beautiful pink color, which made me enjoy it even more.\n(I really wanted to try the Yuzu Sorbet or Black Sesame Soft Serve, but unfortunately, both were out of stock.)\n\nTL;DR: The inside of Momonoki is a beautiful space, but the food isn't as impressive (especially for the price) and the flavor is lacking.",
