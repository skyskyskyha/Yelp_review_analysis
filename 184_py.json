                "text": "What an incredible dining experience. We loved the interesting twist on elevated Mediterranean food here. We brought my parents when they were in town visiting, and they can be picky eaters, but they also loved everything we ordered. The service was great, and they were able to get us in an out in a reasonable amount of time since we had a show to attend that night. \n\nMy mom and I split the cauliflower salad, which I was surprised to find was a cold salad. It was tasty and had surprise ingredients in it, like almonds. Not something I would have thought to put together, but it worked! The shrimp bucatini was divine, and my husband's gnocchi (he let me try a bite) was the perfect winter comfort food. They helped us pick wine, and it was such a nice, intimate atmosphere that really sets you at ease. Definitely a good place for a special occasion!",

                "text": "Enjoyed what could have been a great food experience save a terrible -- and repeatable hiccup at the end of dessert. \n\nAfter ordering an appetizer (Lamb and Beef Kabobs) and a salad, we were brought out a decent set of main dishes: salmon and the shrimp. Both were fairly good. \n\nHowever, we had to wait 30-40 minutes with no contact from any server after ordering cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. According to the manager on duty, the two chefs rotate between salads and desserts and, at the end of the evening, give preference to the salads. As a result, people have often waited for desserts as the two chefs are making entrees or salads. \n\nSo at a fairly expensive meal, there are literally no servers to be found to say 'hey, given the time frame, let me get the bill' we are held hostage waiting for our dessert to come. \n\n(While we waited another couple parked, came inside the restaurant. ordered dessert and port, finished the meal and packed up to leave all during the time we waited on a dessert we had ordered before they parked to enter.)\n\nThat's terribly disappointing for what could be a nice night. And there is a fix that is as common as what happens at Chick Fil-a or any other much less elevated dining experience: 'our cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and desserts may take a while, perhaps order something else or not at all.' But to sit in an intimate restaurant for 30 minutes without a sever -- any server -- in sight as they gather listlessly on their phones is not the experience you'd expect for an elevated and pricey dining experience. \n\nGiven this is a known issue, where management or ownership glibly just says, 'sorry thanks for the feedback', I'd have to recommend avoiding Kitty Dare, as my experience could be yours and they seem indifferent to your night out. \n\nThe food generally is a decent, competent if underwhelming value wise, Italian take on Persian food. That said, there are places that do better of both, close by that are much more interested in your dining experience.",

Great ambiance . \nMy husband loves gin n tonic but this was too much for him with strong rosemary flavor\nI had the fig forward drink but couldn't taste the fig but it was good. We ordered burrata which was okay not so great and loved the eggplant dip. For dinner we had the veggie gnocchi covered with harissa 6/10 , salmon with risotto7/10 , lamb burger  6/10 and I had the shrimp pasta with crushed pistachio which was an 8/10 \nWe all felt we could make this at home. The cheesecake for dessert with  pistachio was underwhelming \nThe service was excellent\nHaving so many excellent middle eastern restos now in atlanta, this one stands out because of its more Italian menu. I am not sure I would return with having so many choices elsewhere.",

It is unrecognizable form the prior restaurant. Gorgeous black and white tile line the inside with a splash of bright blue to liven up the inside. \n\nEli's G+T is the way to go - just look how big the drink is! I loved the splash of apricot that made it a bit different than your average G+T. It was light and refreshing, perfect to wash down our appetizers.\n\nThe orange and fennel salad was so unique with the fennel flavor in the background - not overwhelming. It had the lightest vinaigrette dressing too which was delightful. The Tunisi Eggplant is another sharable plate, in fact it was big, we barely made a dent in our entrees. I'd recommend visiting KD with at least four people if you plant to try a bunch of dishes.\n\nMy Gnocchi with lamb was delicious and reminded me a bit of Moussaka. The Teres Major is basically steak frites and so plentiful. It comes with a gremolata too for dipping. \n\nWe ordered 2 desserts: the white chocolate Pistachio cheesecake and the Saffron and Dates panna cotta. The first was the better of the two but if you love panna cotta you can't go wrong with that choice either. \n\nOh and our server was wonderful at making recommendations and helping navigate the menu. Highly recommend visiting.",

The food, service, ambience, free and easy street parking (which is so rare in ATL!) - really everything about Kitty Dare makes it my #1 pick for a large variety of occasions - a dinner for a large group, or an intimate group.\n\nI had a reservation for about 8 people - it was very easy to book online. I had to call to ask some questions. Someone answered immediately, and was extremely helpful and accommodating of my needs.\n\nWe were seated immediately for our reservation - a long very comfortable table. Restaurant is gorgeous - love the tiles, great ambiance for a lovely long dinner to catch up with friends. The music is the perfect volume, great jazz music that's the perfect backdrop.\n\nWe had a round of drinks (the G&T is so refreshing and aromatic!) and had some appetizers to share. The charcuterie board is huge, and amazing - someone said they could order a whole board for dinner instead of getting a entr\u00e9e and would be very happy. The fried olives on the board is a standout -  crispy tempura-ish coating - so good. We also got the labneh (sumac, pomegranates, olives) with the house made barbari bread (the bread is AMAZING) as well as the dip trio (all the dips were delicious). \n\nEveryone was happy with their entrees - my catch of the day salmon and lemon zest risotto was AMAZING. The best piece of salmon I've ever had. We also had the bebere chicken, the bucatini and shrimp, the cavatelli alla genovese. All the dishes really highlighted the Mediterranean Italian fusion Kitty Dare does.\n\nWe were pretty full, but had an eye on desserts. The white chocolate and pistachio cheesecake is SO good - very rich and sweet, but perfect for those who want a traditional dessert. We also got the cardamom orange creme brulee (very aromatic, loved the orange flavor really came through) and the saffron and dates panna cotta (I LOVED this one, the texture was amazing and it comes with crunchy chocolate and cookie crumbles).\n\nWhen we finally wrapped up, we were surprised at how easy it was to split the check (a lot of places give you a hard time but Kitty Dare made it really easy and didn't pressure us to do one check). The waiter had a card reader and everyone paid quickly.\n\nAll in all, we spent 2.5 hours at dinner - this is the perfect place to really enjoy a long meal with friends. I will be back!! The rest of the dessert menu is calling to me, and they update the menu seasonally.",

The restaurant is a Mediterranean cuisine with some Italian influences. \n\nWe ordered the lebnah appetizer, lamb burger, and the bucatini and shrimp dish. Everything we ordered was so. Lebnah had pomegranate pieces in it which I thought was a good addition. However, my favorite ingredient was the pistachios in the shrimp dish. Oh! The lamb meat was halal (although our server was unfamiliar with it despite it being a Mediterranean restaurant) - but I appreciated the fact they had this kind of meat very much. \n\nThe next time we order the burger, we will eat it with a fork and knife since it can get a little messy due to the delicious sauces. In the end, we are for sure coming back.",

Our service was excellent, and the food was unique and delicious. Most surprising was the incredible paella. Highly recommend the Shrimp Bucatini, dates, paella, and Citrus Salmon, though everything was very good. We enjoyed all the deserts as well, but if you have to pick one, get the cheesecake- it's incredible. Can't wait to go back here!",

The owner is inviting and has a great story to tell. The bread is made in home and goes well with the Dips Trio, loved the Mirza Ghasemi! Not sure if the pasta is made in house but I'm convinced it is, so let's just say that. Really great place to try out, you won't be disappointed and I can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu\u203c Loved it! #mediterranean #atlantaeats #atlantafoodie #kittydareatl #foodreview #foodstagram",

Try the eggplant appetizer with the bacon wrapped dates then on to the meat and seafood paella. Really Good bartender!",

We appreciated the owner, Jaamy, coming to check on us too!\n\nHere's what I tried:\n- Dips Trio ($16): Really tasty dips! My only complaint was that it came with 4 slices of (super delicious) bread and the ratio of bread to dip was wayyyy off. And they charged for more bread. It should come with at least double that.\n- Melanzane a Funghetto ($28): Super good!! The burrata, eggplant, and sauce were great! Between the appetizer and this dish, I was pretty full! I was able to take half home for lunch the next day.\n- Lamb Shell Pasta Special: The lamb was perfect. Beautiful presentation!\n- White Chocolate Pistachio Cheesecake ($9): OMGGGGG. Heavenly.\n\nI was between 4 and 5 stars, mostly because of the lack of bread in the dip trio. I decided to round up, but I really hope they're more generous with the bread in the future!",

The portions were generous, and there were enough leftovers for a third meal. The service was attentive without being overly so, which I appreciate.

The food runners were also impeccable as they knew our correct seat numbers and presented all the charcuterie items. Now for the food! I decided to get the french toast last minute and it was delectable! The charcuterie was also a great selection. Every single thing was great. Love that they use Thomasville Tomme cheese from my hometown. I also really liked the lamb. There was also a gin drink that my friend got that was super refreshing but I forgot what it was called. And the establishment is very pretty indeed. Thank you Kitty Dare for making our friend's birthday celebration so special!",

The apps and drinks were our favorite part of the meal and both those apps are a must try. \nDinner I had the shrimp pasta and my boyfriend had the lamb burger. My pasta was really good and the portion was not slacking. Looking at pictures on here, I was expecting small portions, but the plates are just massive. The lamb burger was good, but wasn't your typical lamb burger and tasted more like a gyro, so if that's what you want from it, you'll get it.\nOnly thing I have to complain about is the dessert. We ordered the eggplant chocolate cake. Just don't do it unless you want to be eating eggplant for dessert. Wasn't expecting the flavor and texture to be so prominent. \nService was decent and the back portion of the restaurant was a nice place to sit. Quieter and more personal. \nThis place is really worth the try and we plan on being back!",

I'm not sure but they may have recently started serving brunch because of the fact that I couldn't find their brunch menu anywhere. \n\nWell, I decided to go and I'm so glad to have found this place! It's a Mediterranean inspired restaurant. They serve the typical Shakshuka to pancakes to scramble. I got the Sunday scramble with asparagus and chives, side of big pieces of potatoes and fruit. Loved the seasoning on the potatoes though I wish they were cut smaller because I like them crispy. The scramble itself was ok, it was missing salt in my opinion but it had a good amount of asparagus. My friend ordered the ricotta pancakes, which I tried and it was delicious. The pancake itself was fluffy and moist but tasted too egg-y for me. However, the lemon cream on top really put the dish together.\n\nTheir service was great as well! I'd come back here to try their normal menu fares. There's tons of street parking and conveniently located across the street from Inman Park marta.",

It's easy to make a reservation, beautiful inside and well laid out so you don't feel like the next patron is sitting on top of you, and the service and food were both amazing. We had labneh, koobideh kebab, some yummy summer drinks, Caesar salad, zucchini, feta fries, shrimp garlic bucatini, lamb gnocchi, orange cardamom creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and a phyllo dough orange and cheese dessert. I would recommend all of it. The server was very knowledgeable and let us know that the menu was Mediterranean fusion, drawing inspiration from several different countries and cultures. I feel that they performed on that very well. It was fun to try new things and to enjoy them!",

Both were insanely good. The fries were fresh, seasoned properly with salt which I always appreciate, and had plenty of feta on them. They were addictive & I loved the pairing of the feta & herbs with the potatoes. The dip trio was also insanely good. The bread was fresh & moist & I loved how it was crunchy, yet still soft & drizzled with olive oil. I really enjoyed 2 of the dips (salmon & the darker green which I forgot the name of), but the pea & pistachio one wasn't my favorite. It didn't have much flavor but it was refreshing & different than anything I've ever had before, so it was fun to try. I also got a drink, I believe it was called a 'Paige' but it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. It was a fig or currant(?) vodka with orange bitters & soda. It was super refreshing & finally a drink I actually enjoyed because it was so balanced. \n\nThe ambiance is great, it's a very eclectic and cute restaurant. Its laid back but also very nice, it would be perfect for date nights or special occasions but I also could go there on a random weeknight & treat myself to dinner & not feel out of place. The service was great & all of the staff was very nice. They were attentive & the place was staffed well so I didn't wait long for anything or feel like I had been neglected by the waitress. \n\nOverall, I loved this place & would now consider it one of my favorite restaurants! I can't wait to come back & try more",

Perfectly prepared cocktails and Spanish style mussels with trio dip started our evening. Cannot recommend the mussels enough!! The Dips Trio each have different flavors that simply complement each other. All delicious. Next a Caesar with white anchovies (the better ones) and added shrimp. Again, more deliciousness. And a perfectly crisped piece of bacon accompanied for a very nice, fresh flavor combo. Yum. And so unusually here we opted to head straight to dessert, simply knowing we'd never be able to finish and enjoy it already being a bit full. Eggplant Chocolate cake is the most unique cake I've enjoyed simply because well, it has eggplant. Not sweet at all and simply divine. The Cardamom orange creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is another great choice that has a very nice thick hard shell and super creamy inside with flavor that's subtle in exactly the right way. Kitty Dare is a great choice for a very satisfying evening out!",

It was probably my favorite burrata salad I have ever had. I didn't notice until my husband said it that this salad had no bread, and I loved that. Absolutely no carbs since it was burrata cheese, prosciutto, and butter lettuce. After that appetizer, I had the shrimp with Buka teeny. It was outstanding! The garlic combined with some interesting spices was a nice change, and the topping of crushed pistachio was the bomb . My husband ordered the pasta Bolognese, and I had a bite, but liked it slightly less. A little bit too much sweetness in the sauce. I prefer a Bolognese that is more on the savory side.",

The restaurant is named after owner Jamshad Jaamy Zarnegars' late friend Kitty Dare Ethridge, who talked of opening a restaurant together before she died from ovarian cancer. Executive Chef Giuseppe Esposito delivers an explorable menu inspired by dishes found in the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, and the Middle East. The extensive wine list curated by Zarnegar richly enhances the total dining experience.\n\nFor a deliciously vibrant flavorful meal, I recommend the burrata salad, koobideh kabab, and the lamb ragu gnocci. The flower presentation of the burrata salad was absolutely beautiful!\n\nI love that Kitty Dare celebrates not only the diverse cuisines found throughout the Mediterranean, but also the life of the owner's dear friend!",

                "text": "I was so excited to try this place. Atmosphere was lovely but we don't go to eat the walls. The service was okay but our server seemed lifeless almost. He wasn't bad at his job but he seems sad, idk, totally not something anyone can control. On to the real deal...The Food. It was mid at best. We tried the Aracini, mussels and a Caesar salad for apps. For entree i had the Risotto with market catch and my husband had the bolognese.\nThe aracini was arguably the best dish. Crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside. The mussels were not memorable, the red sauce had no real flavor, so odd. The salad... tasted like nothing. Just crunchy, wet leaves. The dressing tasted like absolutely nothing... how? Bagged Caesar kits from Kroger are 10x  better. This was actually surprising, how is a Caesar salad bad?! \nOn to the meals... tragedy struck. Typically I order Risotto any time it's on the menu at a restaurant and I also make it at home. It should be creamy, thick and Al dente. This risotto was weird, pieces of my were hard, even crunchy. There was no consistency in the texture. Also the flavor was off...the risotto was tomato based... the catch of the day was cod. The garlicky tomato risotto completely overpowered the delicates mild white fish. Also if you know cod, the cut matters. I just feel restaurants should serves the center cut/cod loin, otherwise due to its delicate nature it just falls apart. Welp yelp you guessed it. It was not a center cut... so looked like grilled soggy toilet paper. The bolognese was greasy and salty af, nothing else to report. My pregnant feet were swollen after this meal, which rarely happens. Oh speaking of pregnant, i ordered a mocktail, the server said the could make anything without alcohol. And maybe it my fault for ordering a mocktail margarita at a Mediterranean place but I'm positive it was just lime juice and water.... My husband like his champagne cocktail, it was the only thing he liked. Sighhhh maybe brunch is better.",
