It has many freshly baked pre-wrapped goods - both sweet and savory. They also have a menu of hot food to order and an extensive drink menu. I only bought the baked goods so cannot comment on the quality of their hot food or drinks.\n\nI ordered a mango bun, chocolate chip cookie, mozzarella bun and a chocolate filled roll. Everything tasted really fresh and the cookie was soft inside. My 4 items cost about $12. \n\nThere are many tables inside to sit and enjoy your food or do work. I think there was also a sign for free wifi but I was only here briefly. It's located right on Peachtree street so not sure what the parking is like. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area!",

If you feel comfortable to do so, you're more than welcome to email your thoughts to me at kavi@sweethut.com and I'll make sure to pass that right on to our management + kitchen so they're made aware and can act accordingly!\n\nThank you so much again for stopping by and we hope to see you again soon, Elisa!\n\nBest,\n\nKavi",

It is quite sweet though. Even the actual creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e here is sooooo good. I love that you get two free toppings with the milk tea here. Also almost all the milk teas have customizable sugar and ice which is great! I don't enjoy boba that is too chewy, so the brown sugar crystal here is my absolute favorite boba topping I've ever tried. It's texture is the perfect blend between boba and jelly and the flavor is so yummy. I also love the custard pudding! Some of my food favs are the salt and pepper chicken nuggets (so spicy, have paprika not just salt and pepper), curry chicken bun (melt in your mouth sweet bun with super flavorful chicken inside), garlic cheese bun (so buttery, so cheesy, slight garlic, MELTS IN MOUTH). Taro and Thai tea are also pretty good here! The place is quite nice, good to work at! The teas are always made SO quick.",

You can grab a little basket and glove and fill it to your hearts desires. everything is Malaysian or American inspired and baked fresh daily.\n\nNext you've got the cafe which offers both hot and cold snacks to meals.\n\nSweet Hut also offers Trivia on Tuesdays and is PERFECT for studying and working as they do offer free wifi. I personally enjoyed working here because the music and the volume from others was minimal. They also had TONS of space both indoors and outdoors so you didn't have have to feel cramped in or fight for outlets. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend giving Sweet Hut a try if you're ever looking for fresh baked goods and a comfy place to work!",

Personally, it is my favorite place to get one, and my whole family agrees! \n\nI've tried a few other buns here, but personally find them too sweet or bland - but my go to's keep me coming back! \n\nThe drinks are also very delish & I'm a huge fan that you can personalize sweetness and ice levels! Here are a couple of my fav drinks:\n- Vietnamese Iced Coffee\n- Lychee Green Tea + double lychee jelly\n\nTotally check this place out for some great buns & drinks!",

                "text": "I was visiting Atlanta on a girls trip and wanted Taiwanese food. I researched what's around my hotel, and stumbled across sweet hut bakery on Yelp. I called and ordered ahead, so glad I did because it was quite busy. I got the Taiwanese popcorn chicken and milk tea with boba. The popcorn chicken is delicious and the milk tea was pretty good. I wish the boba is a bit softer, but can't complain, still pretty tasty. I was happy to find out they do customized drinks. I cannot stand the taste of creamer or dairy free creamer powder, so they were able to make it with fresh milk for me. The bread selection there was awesome, i bought a taro mochi bun and a taro almond bun, both taste phenomenal. 10/10 I highly recommended this place.",

If you're looking for something new, I recommend the Royal Milk Tea (75% sugar) with boba, he he.\n\nAnd we appreciate your feedback regarding the upkeep of our space. Being in the heart of Midtown, we definitely have a lot of foot traffic, but it's no excuse to have an untidy space. I'll send your review over to our management so they're made aware of this and can kindly remind our staff to conduct more frequent cleaning checks.\n\nThank you so much again, Haley, and we look forward to serving you again soon!\n\nBest,\n\nKavi",

So many fun pastries and treats to try. Also, my favorite boba tea. I had to purchase a few treats for later. \n\nI love the variety of things they have. The pastries and not overly sweet which was a plus. The sweet breads were pill soft and a joy to eat. I wish I had one now. \n\nThe only thing that may be a draw back was a weird guy hanging around and kind of harassing my co-worker. He made us feel uneasy, so we left after getting our snacks. It wasn't the fault of the establishment, but it was just something that took away from my overall experience.",

The pastries are delicious (my go to is the chocolate buttercream bun), the food is solid (salt & pepper nuggets and lemongrass bbq pork sandwich ), and all of their boba flavors are delicious. Although, I usually get 50-75% sugar level since their drinks are fairly sweet. \n\nWill continue to come here once every few weeks when I'm craving some sugar!",

I don't know why they included other than it's red, I threw them away) also had coconut flakes that were sweeter and a more subtle flavor than normal coconut flakes. If you look closely you can probably see they look like sugar flakes. I don't even like coconut flavor, but this was mild enough and worked with all the flavors. The ONLY thing I didn't like on here were the dried cranberries. Random and weird that they included on this. \n\n$2.50 CUSTARD BUN (3/5): \nBread was sweet and filled with a small amount of custard inside as filling. I wish it had more custard! I threw away the ends/outside of the bun since it was just plain bread and was slightly harder towards the outer ends. Still delicious!\n\n$2.75 BLUEBERRY CREAM CHEESE BUN (2/5): \nBarely ANY filling (see photo). Would not get this one again. Unless you want a plain\n\n$3.50 VIOLET TARO (4/5): I loved the texture of this one! If you like taro, get this! Taro flavored and filled with mochi. Yum\n\n$2.95 BBQ PORK BUN: LOVED THIS TOO! I don't even eat a lot of pork, but it had so much meat filling and the flavor was on point. It's not as good as the puff pastry one, but if you want the same flavor for cheaper, get this one! Delicious! I would get this every time I come. \n\n$4.50 BBQ PORK PUFF PASTRY: The absolute BEST one of the 6 I got! Flaky and buttery puff pastry filled with a TON of delicious flavored pork. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. Get it!",

I love a bubble tea spot that allows you to adjust sweetness and ice as well. The violet bun (taro filled bun) was pretty good and very unique. My husband especially loved that it wasn't too sweet but the texture was something new for us. I was disappointed in the lack of vegetarian savory options (lots of pork and chicken options). Pastry and a small milk tea was $9.20 so pretty middle of the road pricing. \n\nThe inside is kind of fast-food vibe to me, though there were lots of young people on computers or just chatting with each other. Interior could use some revamping ie new chairs and tables but overall a nice stop for a sweet treat or cold drink!",

You walk in and can grab a tray and parchment paper plus tongs. You grab all your pastries that you would like, they usually are all individually wrapped (post-COVID). End at the register and order your drinks and pay for your food.\n\nI would recommend their spicy nuggets, bacon cheese fries, or if you are feeling hungrier, the bulgogi cheesesteak.",

Luckily the lady who actually rang my up was right there and was able to quickly rectify this. But they literally were standing by each other when I placed my order.  \n\nNext time check with your other teammates and staff before telling a guest something like that. Because In my eyes I was called a liar right to my face right after spending 45 dollars in this establishment. I have the right mind to put the ladies name in this review. But I understand people are human and make mistakes and it was the holiday season so I will just take an additional star.",

They taste even better warmed up with a glass of milk! The Macarons are amazing. Each one has a distinctive taste that corresponds to their flavor but you can literally devour them in 2 bites so savor that taste or buy more lol. My favorite were the Chocolate Ganache & Mocha. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the Red Velvet slices, but I'm a big fan of nuts in my red velvet and these didn't have them. However, that doesn't take away from how moist the cake is and how sweet the cream cheese filling is as well.\n\nAll in all if you're a fan of sweets this is definitely a place I recommend you go to. They not only have sweets but they also offer sandwiches, dessert buns and breads, tons of teas, frappes and so much more.",

The original, Duluth, location has a wider variety. \nThings you should know:\nI. LOCATION \nIn the heart of Midtown. Shockingly, there aren't too many restaurants in the heart of the city, unlike New York. So, I'm happy to see some cultured food flourishing so well. \nII. QUALITY\nI'm assuming everything is made fresh daily, but I've had pastries from other local joints that just, I don't know, taste better. It's good for a quick fix though. \nIII. SERVICE\nNo complaints \nIV. CAPACITY\nThis place is always poppin'. Traffic flow at all times of the day is pretty consistent. I'm very happy for the business owners..! Sometimes finding seating can be difficult because it gets so busy, but that's great and not something to complain about.",

There are cakes and puddings and tarts and buns and cheesecakes, you name it! They also serve bubble tea. The staff here are super friendly and accommodating. They are open to giving recommendations and were very kind. There is a microwave in the seating area so you can microwave a bun that you purchase to eat in the store. I think they also have some hot food that they make in their kitchen that you can order.\n\nIf you are in the area and have a sweet tooth or are interested in exploring some asian sweet and savory food - I definitely recommend stopping in to Sweet Hut (& taking several boxes of food home with you!)",

And they were the only place I could find those nuggets and since I no longer work on that side of town , it is now too far for me to drive. I saw these on the menu and said I hope that they were similar. They were almost the exact same chicken nuggets. You can get them spicy and adjust your spice level. \n\nThey Have a lot of other selections for bubble tea and I will try those next",

Also some good sandwiches and salads though I haven't tried as many of those. Also they have a wide selection of both hot and cold teas, with or without Boba, as well as smoothies and coffee drinks. Great lunch spot! Highly recommended!",

I ordered a couple of different things, and they were all good. The wifi connection was strong, there are plenty of power outlets, and the music wasn't too loud. I'd definitely come back here again and try one of their tons of desserts!",
