Bruschetta board is amazing and if you sign up for their emails you get one for free! And they validate parking for two hours! \n\nLoved customizing the board, my dad doesn't like tomatoes and he loved the options we chose. We also got the prosciutto panini and soup of the day (white bean italian sausage). Amazing!! \n\nOur bill in the end was $60 (we each got two glasses of wine!) including a nice tip for our amazing server Lauren. Everyone here made it a point to say hi to us :-) \n\nAmbiance: incredible. Vibes. Check out the pics. \n\nLiterally coming back next week! LOVE postino!!!",

While my visit was part of a larger gathering, I am already planning to return on my own to explore more of the menu.\n\nThe standout feature of Postino's is undoubtedly the delicious food. Every appetizer we tasted during our wine-tasting event was a delightful culinary journey. The chefs at Postino's seem to have mastered the art of creating flavorful and satisfying dishes.\n\nOur group, consisting of 60 women, was treated with kindness and accommodation by the attentive staff. They facilitated a seamless wine tasting and appetizer event, ensuring everyone felt welcome and had an enjoyable experience. The waitresses were not only friendly but also made sure the food kept flowing, maintaining a high level of service throughout the evening.\n\nSpeaking of the wine tasting, while I personally lean towards sweeter wines, I found that I only liked 1 of the options at that night (pre-selected) as the 4 other options were primarily dry or very dry. However, this is a subjective matter, as my companions appreciated the diverse wine selection. The restaurant provided a range of flavors to cater to different preferences, showcasing its commitment to offering a well-rounded experience.\n\nThe atmosphere at Postino's is a perfect blend of mid-volume, calm, and peaceful, making it an ideal setting for both group events and solo excursions. The restaurant's location in a plaza ensures ample parking, though it is worth noting that parking is paid.\n\nAs I plan to revisit Postino's on my own, I'm excited to delve into the main menu and explore a broader selection of dishes. Additionally, I look forward to discovering more wines that align with my personal taste preferences. With its combination of delectable cuisine, welcoming atmosphere, and attentive service, Postino's has certainly earned a spot on my list of go-to dining destinations in West Midtown.",

My favorite was the mexican corn and the apple and fig. \n\nFor dinner I had the select two which was half of a Westcoaster panini and the soup of the moment, Chicken Noodle pesto and lemon soup. Both were okay, nothing special. I felt like the sandwich needed more of the garlic aioli which would of gave it more flavor. I also had a glass of sparkling rose which was good.\n\nOverall, the best way to describe this place is a bougie Corner Bakery. Prices are standard and ambience is nice. I would like to try their brunch as I heard it's really good.",

We ordered a little bit of everything. \n\nWe had the bruschetta spread- each were less than mediocre. Each piece of bread was cold & under toasted, there was zero crunch in each bite. \n\nThe Hannah's salad was a hard pass, I couldn't even  eat it. \n\nThe chicken mozzarella panini was ok. Nothing special. \n\nAnd finally the snack skewers were the highlight of the meal. The chicken one particular had flavor & the yogurt sauce was worth a try. \n\nNeedless to say, we wouldn't recommend this place. There's just too many great option nearby.

The Italiano was amazing and part of the battle of the bruschetta they are doing, also reasonably priced, and I appreciate they are pre cut!\nFor a happy hour or tapas style place, it's a perfect fit.

With its great selection of wine, delicious snacks, and fun decor, what's not to love? \n\nYou walk inside and the first thing you see is an awesome wall made entirely out of different hot wheel cars, funky hanging light fixtures, and lots of bright colored furniture. They also have a great outside patio if you're looking for outdoor seating.\n\nEvery single food item I've gotten here has been delicious, and my favorite option is always the bruschetta board because you can pick 4 different flavors and try a little bit of everything. Right now Postino is doing a \"Battle of the Bruschetta\" to decide which new flavor they'll be adding to the menu and it's such a fun concept to get to try new flavors every two weeks and vote for your favorite. So far the Mexican Street Corn has been on the top for me. \n\nPostino also has a wine box subscription service which is amazing! You get 4 bottles of wine every quarter and perks like a free glass of wine every month.\n\nThis location has a great amount of parking because they have a paid lot right behind the restaurant. Highly recommend for a fun little night out!",

Well worth the wait! \n\nThere is street parking and a nice size lot behind the restaurant in the Brick Works plaza. I attended on a Monday and as far as i know parking is not free. There is a pay machine or you may scan the QR code to access ParkEaz app for better convenience to register your vehicle and pay - which is what did. The first 30 mins of parking is free, however the bartender provided me their internal QR code for additional savings. Sorry I can't remember the actual amount. Moving onto the establishment. The entire restaurant is very lively and full of different pops of color. The ambiance naturally puts you in that spring/summer mood.  My friend and I opted to sit at the bar which had plenty of space for us to dine. Jaylynn (bartender) was very accommodating and was able to give great recommendations. \n\nMy selections were as follows..\n\nSnacky Thing of choice:\n* Scrimp Scampi\n\nBruschetta Board of choice: \n* Sweet N' Spicy Pepper Jam & Goat cheese\n* Mushroom & Mascarpone \n* Fresh Mozzarella Tomato & Basil\n* Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato \n\nThe scrimp scampi was very good. I enjoyed all of my bruschetta choices, however, the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato was my favorite. \n\nDrink of choice: \n* 2 glasses of Ros\u00e9 champagne with strawberry garnish (YUM) \n\nBoth Jaylynn and restaurant owner Luciano were a pleasure! Luciano even went out of his way to accommodate my friend with replacing one of her items that she'd received that was not favorable unsolicited. Customer service was top notch! Postino is a great place for date night, girls night, family/ friends gathering or just a solo stop to grab a bite at the bar. The music selections were upbeat, a whole vibe! The open patio is nice and is nicely lite up for a relaxed, cozy evening. \n\nShouts out and many Thank You's to the Postino crew for the stellar hospitality! A totally WIN! I'll definitely be returning. Until next time, SYOY!",

I got to try every option they have and I'd definitely go for the fig, smoked salmon, and bacon one. The best snacky thing is hands down the crispy cauliflower. It's so well cooked and flavorful, the sauce is amazing. I think people usually avoid paying for vegetables but this is THE dish to get. I'm actually trying to make a knock off version at home. The smoked salmon is also a fun board and very good, would recommend. Skewers are ok.\n\nI think the downsides to this place is that you have to pay for parking, and they only serve beer or wine. They do have mock tails though! Otherwise the ambiance is lovely, there's outdoor and indoor seating, and it's a very nice date or hang out spot with friends and coworkers.",

Our waitress got us seated quickly and gave us some amazing recommendations for drinks!! We ordered our wine and then got some appetizers. \n\nWe got the meatballs and the shrimp scampi to start along with some bread for the meatballs. They were both delicious and the shrimp was great and lemony! We also got the bruschetta boards and it was all amazing and such a great deal! The brushetta boards are definitely the main attraction and you can't come here without getting one\n\nFor my main, I did the 1/2 nine iron and half Caesar salad and the sandwich and salad was amazing. Overall, the prices are amazing and the food is just amazing. The staff was excellent and it is a gorgeous restaurant. It honestly cannot be recommended enough!",

This is a plus! \n\nThe space is inviting. We learned that each location pays hommage to their location.  This westside location used to be a Ford Motor Cars dealership so hence the use of cars on the wall. \n\nAlthough there was a DJ (really nice) inside, we opted to sit on the patio because the weather was great! I love the outdoor fireplace. Def a vibe.  \n\nWe had the bruschetta boards which cans with four options.  I believe we had the Burrata, Brie, and prosciutto. I can't recall the fourth one. Aye!  Also ordered the Shakshouka. It was good but I'm used to having this dish with over easy baked eggs. The eggs were instead boiled but still not cooked through which I love.  It was served with meatballs so it was filling.  Delish. \n\nParking: plentiful this time of day but it's paid parking. Resto is located in Brickworks.  \n\nI had the Bellini at brunch which was perfect.  Will return to try their wine. I suspect this will be one of my go to spots this spring and summer.",

In the evening, it's intimate and such a vibe. \n\nThe crispy cauliflower was really delicious. It was tender paired with a lovely sauce. The bruschetta was so delicious! I love that you can pick 4 - the mushroom one and the burrata bacon one was a 10/10! The OMG Grilled Cheese was soooo good! We asked the bacon to be on the side. I would definitely get that again. The smoked salmon was great as well, I really enjoyed the dip.\n\nI really enjoyed my experience here. The vibes and the food were wonderful. I can't wait to come back. \n\nIt is paid parking but lots of parking spaces.",

Your mouth literally drops as soon as you walk in, and even though it was quite beautiful on the inside, I decided to sit on the patio, which was still just as pleasant. The atmosphere was so peaceful at this time! \n\n* Drinks\nI greatly appreciate the variety in wines and the education of the menu. There is nothing better than  looking on a menu that is detailed and informative.\n\n* Service\nI absolutely loved our kind and patient server. She was so attentive and patient with us, and did a great job with recommendations. \n\n* Food\nThis place is definitely meant for lunch. The dishes were very light and almost gave me a small plate vibe. The skewers were definitely a must have, there were so juicy and the sauce it laid on was paired so well. \n\n* Price\nThe lunch wine menu was so price so well at $6 a cup, keep in mind it was enough for two glasses. It also carried almost half of the full menu wines on the lunch menu, and who wouldn't enjoy options and variety. The food was already very inexpensive, with a most expensive dish ranging at under $25",

The avocado toast did not have much avocado and it was brown by the time it came out. Portions were small. Not much variety in the options. However, the fritters were a hit (pic attached). All in all was kind of disappointed but I still have hope so will return.",

I highly recommend the shrimp scampi and brussels sprouts salad. There's a large selection of wine. We tried a few different wines, but the Riesling was my favorite.",

And today was a special day as they had all employees in training for the upcoming opening on Monday so everything was comped for all visitors. \n\nI was glad to assist in their training!\n\nUpon arrival, I parked in the parking lot which is quite spacious behind the facility. But you will have to pay unless you are only there for 20 minutes which is highly unlikely for any restaurant. \n\nWhen I walked in, I noticed the place was bustling with people but not overcrowded. Everyone had enough room to sit and enjoy their wine and/or food. And I loved how the restaurant looked. \n\nAs part of this day, you could pick different items off of the menu to try, an appetizer, entree, dessert and one drink. I started with the sweet potato wedges recommended from the waitress that assisted me the most (note on this day any of the wait staff could stop by to help but Victoria was my main contact). The sweet potato wedges were ok. I wouldn't recommend them unless you enjoy very salty food. \n\nNow for the entree, I didn't want a huge meal. So I asked for another recommendation she pointed out they half and half meals. So instead of getting a full panini I could get half with half salad/soup. I went with that option and was quite please. The Nine Iron panini was delicious! Flavorful! And omg I have never been so impressed with a salad before! The mixed greens salad was delicious! It had a sprinkle of feta cheese, some grapes and pecans to top off the greens!\n\nAnd by the way, I had a glass of Malbec which was great! The brand was Espiritu. The right amount of dryness. \n\nLastly, I had the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e for a dessert which was great and recommended by my waitress. It came with a side of strawberries and it was delicious! I devoured the dessert lol. \n\nOverall I was quite pleased and will return! And Victoria was a great waitress. She was very personable and knowledgeable. I hope she has a great experience working there.",

However, I have to admit that it didn't quite live up to the hype for me. The reviews were stellar, but my experience left something to be desired.\n\nLet's talk about the food first. We ordered four types of bruschetta: Smoked Salmon & Pesto,  Ricotta, Dates & Pistachio, Brie, Apple & Fig Spread, and Fresh Mozzarella, Tomato & Basil. I also got the OMG Grilled Cheese, and I can't deny that they were tasty. Each bite was satisfying, and I have no complaints about the flavors. However, what bothered me a bit was that everything felt a bit clich\u00e9. I was hoping to find something unique and special, that kind of dish or feature that makes you think, \"Wow, you can only get this here!\" Unfortunately, that was missing for me, and it left me wanting a bit more excitement in my dining experience.\n\nOn the positive side, their wine and beer selection was decent, offering a variety of options to choose from. The staff was friendly and provided good service, which is always a plus. I also appreciated the fact that they have both indoor and outdoor seating, and the place is quite spacious.\n\nWhile I'm not bursting with enthusiasm to go back right away, I would be open to giving this place another chance. Maybe trying different dishes or visiting on a different day could make a difference. I believe there's potential for improvement, and I'm willing to explore it.\n\nIn a nutshell, my experience at this place was not mind-blowing, but the food was good, the staff was friendly, and the indoor/outdoor seating options were nice. I'll keep it on my radar for a possible revisit, hoping to discover that extra spark that will truly make it stand out.",

I also like that the bar has garage door-style windows on the back side that can be opened up to the patio on days where the weather is beautiful.\n     I sat at the bar and ordered the Crispy Cauliflower, Skewers Snack, Shrimp Scampi, Vegetarian Panini, a Bruschetta Board (with Burrata Bacon Arugula, Mushroom & Mascarpone, Pepper Jam Goat Cheese, and Brie Apple Fig), and another Bruschetta Board (with Pepper Jam Goat Cheese, Burrata Bacon Arugula, Mozzarella Tomato Basil, and Mushroom & Mascarpone).\n     I really enjoyed the grilled petite filet skewer but not so much the chicken skewer so I replaced it with another steak skewer instead. I must say that the sicilian garlic yogurt that came with the skewers was so good! I also fully enjoyed the choices I made for my Bruschetta Board and would get them all again. I also had a glass of the Pinot Bianco-Sauvignon and a glass of the Cava to drink. Both wines were tasty.\n     Overall, this was a great visit with a very relaxed vibe and I will definitely be returning.",

Both wines were great! We also ordered the sweet potato wedges, chefs charcuterie board, nine iron panini w salad, and west coaster panini with potato leek soup. The sweet potato wedges were just okay, but everything else was phenomenal!! All of the ingredients were very high quality and flavorful. The prices were also extremely reasonable.

My boyfriend started with a glass of red wine and ordered the smoked salmon dip as an appetizer. My only description is don't think about it, just order it. I was truly amazed at how delicious the dip and smoked salmon was. Since we weren't too hungry, we ordered a charcuterie board to share. This was my first time trying a board, and this definitely exceeded my expectations. The vast variety of meat, cheese, dip, and bread all paired well together. Overall, this restaurant is a 10/10, and I can't wait to return again.",

The vibe is so cute inside and outside but the patio is to die for. The yellow umbrellas and layout remind me a bit of Miami. They have lights out on the patio as well so I'm sure the night time vibe is super cute as well.\n\nI had the grilled cheese with tomato soup and the bruschetta with apple and goat cheese and the other one had a red pepper paste. All super flavorful and tasty I really enjoyed it. They also have a wine happy hour every day (unheard of!) so I'll definitely be back for a $6 glass of wine. I tried the rose and it was crisp and refreshing.\n\nThe manager Tim came by to check on me and a few other tables and he was really nice and friendly as well. Overall definitely 5 stars and I'm looking forward to coming back for lunch and dinner another time!",

We order several things for the table and everything was good. I had the wine cocktail Killer Queen and it was delicious.  The only negative was the bathroom was way too dark. I had to run the flashlight on my camera on to make sure I locked the stall properly. Other than that, it was great. Definitely planning to go back.",
