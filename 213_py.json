The broth is rich, but a bit salty. The noodles are fresh and perfectly cooked. They have different selections of ramen broth base, but at the time there was only pork broth available. Each ramen entree come with slices of pork and and a perfect cooked soft boiled egg. I like that they offered other options like rice bowl, curry and a lot of variety of appetizers. The portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable. Overall, foods was average, service staff is pretty good, restaurant atmosphere is casual.",

The restaurant was pretty empty when I went, but got busier a half hour later. \n\nAmbience: The restaurant had an industrial design with the unfinished slab floors, exposed ceilings, and Edison light bulbs. The kitchen is exposed with the glass windows. Super casual chill vibes here. \n\nFood: The menu was pretty simple and straightforward. There is a standard selection of ramen that already comes with an egg and sliced pork. Additional toppings were available at a charge if you want to customize your bowl further. I had the spicy miso ramen, which I thought was a little salty. I liked that the noodles tasted fresh. The egg was slightly undercooked as I'd prefer it to be medium-boiled instead of the yolk being a little runny. The egg was also not marinated enough, if not, at all. I think nori seaweed should be a standard topping for all ramen, which was missing from the ramen bowl. The octopus ball takoyaki tasted flavorful and pretty much equal to other takoyaki I've had at other Japanese restaurants. \n\nService:\nOur server was friendly, attentive, and professionally answered our questions about the menu. Waters were refilled and the food came out in reasonable time. \n\nOverall, I think the ramen could be slightly improved in terms of balancing the flavor in the broth. Service was excellent.",

I think goodness they were because it led me to go to Hajime for lunch.\n\nTucked right in the corner of the Briarcliff shopping center is this hidden gem. Upon entering I was greeted by my server instantly I also noticed the restaurant was much more spacious than I anticipated. I was told to sit wherever and decided to best see that the house was at the bar.\n\nInitially the QR menu was not working for me so I asked the waiter what he recommended for an appetizer and he said the kani no ebi maki... Of course I had no idea what that was but it's shrimp wrapped in cucumber topped with a crab mix and a spicy Mayo sauce on top. It was delicious! I inquired about alcohol and my waiter told me about go to fridge and pick what I thought looked good. Well I was in luck because I found a lychee seltzer that was perfect not too sweet. I wish they sold those in stores.\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I already knew based on the name that I was getting the stir fried kimchi Ramen with the spicy noodles. If you're wondering it was not really spicy at all. But the flavor was absolutely delicious and to my surprise the chicken was cooked perfectly. That dish was The perfect size and hit the spot the noodle to ingredient ratio was spot on as well. I could definitely see myself going back to try some of the other things they have on the menu since my initial experience was so great.",

                "text": "If there's a few spots off Cheshire-Bridge, there is one place you'll need to stop by and it's Hajime Ramen.\n\nIt's literally tucked in the corner of the Briarcliff shopping center literally pushed to the furthest corner of the plaza.\n\nI didn't know this but the people that own Umaido in Suwanee also own this place as well so there should be some consistency in the ramen and needless to say, it is consistent.\n\nI needed lunch as I forgot to pack and I did want to try Hajime as per a recommendation from a co-worker so I opted for it.\n\nThe place has an industrial feel to it with it's sealed/treated concrete flooring, exposed ceiling, and with it being a bit larger than it's sister restaurant made for a more relaxed dining experience, especially since Hajime has bar seating in it as well.\n\nNow the food.  I decided to order the lunch combo special.  $24 dollars for a measly bowl of rice and edamame.  I'm not big with the soy beans so I left that out but the karaage don they served was fantastic!  The chicken was plump and juicy!  The breading wasn't overwhelming.  The flavor was grand.\n\nAlong with the lunch special, I had to order a bowl of ramen which was the main goal.  I opted for the ultra spicy x2 tonkatsu ramen.  The ramen definitely had a rich broth to it.  And the spice level of it was odd.  Yes it did have bite and it complimented the rich porky broth but something about it seemed off.  Perhaps the after effects of MSG which I could tell had loads of it since I had that after consumption savory burn to it.  The noodles were thin which held the broth per slurp.  The chashu pork slices were flavorful with just enough fattyness.\n\nOverall, I'm not too sold on the place because it was lunch and not a whole lot of people during the 12:30 lunch hour but the food itself was decent and definitely a good spot to hit up for a lunch if you're in the Lindbergh-Buckhead area.",

Staff is wearing masks.\n\nHere's what we got:\n- Tori Ramen ($12): The broth was super good. Loved the fried onions and soft boiled egg. There was kale instead of spinach, but I didn't mind.\n- Tonkotsu Ramen ($11): My husband really enjoyed his ramen.\n\nIt was packaged really nicely for takeout. The bowl with the ingredients was big enough to pour all the broth into when we got home.\n\nFor the price, the portion, and the taste, we would definitely order from here again!",

We got here at around 8:45 pm, and they were scheduled to close at 9:30 pm.  There were only two employees working at the time, and I was afraid that they were either going to tell us that they weren't seating anymore customers for the night, or would rush us.  However, neither was the case, since the host/server warmly greeted us immediately when we walked in and invited us to sit anywhere, and we sat at a small table against the wall.  There were two other groups of people in the restaurant with us, and they didn't look like they were in any hurry to leave.\nOur server gave us menus and left us to take care of the other tables.  He came back within a few minutes and we each ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen.  We got our food within 10 minutes, nice and hot.  The egg was perfectly cooked medium, the pork was seared perfectly and the flavor was great, and I loved how the broth tasted.  The crunchy textures of the veggies were ideal.  We both loved the quick and efficient service and the outstanding food, and we were out of there by 9:30 pm without feeling rushed!\n\nThe restaurant is light on decor on the inside, and, to me, looks like a mix of industrial meets Japanese, with more industrial than Japanese.  That didn't matter that much to me, since everything else was great",

You see the 2 Ultra had inedible Pork pieces, we have pictures, due to all fat and no meat. Same thing in the rice. \n\nIf your looking for just an average bowl it's okay but for the money we will pass.  There are just too many better bowls out there",

When I tell you it was perfect, I mean it was exactly what I had hoped for and more.\n\nAs someone who LOVES spicy foods, I'd say their spice levels are akin to Thai spiciness so I'd advise starting with Level 1 and if it's not enough, going up the next visit. I appreciate the fact that they didn't try to lower the spiciness because of my appearance as some restaurants specializing in foreign cuisines have been known to do. It was a perfect meal and I will 100% be returning.",

I have had a marathon of craving ramen lately and never tried this place before and thought I'd give it a shot since my go-to place is closed on Monday's. Really wish I went elsewhere. Looked like only one person was working in the back and there was one server on-site. He was dragging his feet to get to every customer, including a larger party. There wasn't an exorbitant amount of customers so I didn't understand the sloth-like movement. Took my ramen 30 mins to come and it was extremely lackluster and overly spicy. I ordered the kimchi ramen with fried chicken and the chicken was meh. I only ate 1 out of the 3 pieces and forced the rest of the ramen down my throat. The broth was okay, had a strange sour taste to it but that could've been with all the toppings. \n\nThis place seems to be a hit or miss based on the reviews below. Obviously a miss for me.

It can be difficult for a large family to find places we all enjoy. One of our 3 sons (age 19 college student in Boston where there are many authentic noodle restaurants) and he loved Hajime. Our daughter(age 24) lives in Denver, is extra particular and loved the food as well as the vibe.  The other two both like the ramen Bowls very much and try the higher spice levels.  The service can range from very good to a little sparse but most restaurants these days struggle with finding consistent reliable engaging employees.  The cucumber ap is always very fresh and tasty.  I don't go as spicy as level 1 or 2 and love the Tonkatsu and the Honey ramen. They also have a very nice variety of  specialty beers. I hope Hajime will gain more fans and I plan to recommend to more people.",

I was excited about this place bc of the braised pork belly however this appetizer was burnt...I didn't complain or send back. I waited until I got my noodle bowl and try to use some of the broth to add to the flavor. But that didn't help. The Ramen noodle bowl was extremely spicy, which is what I asked for. But the pork was less than stellar, and the noodles reminded me of Angel hair pasta versus ramen noodles. I do know different restaurants use different noodles. The amount of food that is given is a lot for the price. The service was stellar, but I was the only person in the restaurant at the time. The decor was interesting. With all of the ramen noodle restaurants in Alanta, I'm not sure I would return to this one.",

There's a small bar with a tv & a couple high tops on one side & then a bigger space on the other side with lots of tables. It's a very chill but still trendy place. \n\nMy food order is the ultra spicy lvl 2 (automatically comes with pork-im sure you can opt out tho) with a side of chicken katsu & a hajime mule. \n\nI'm definitely not well versed in the world of ramen so I'm not sure how common this is but  Hajime makes their noodles in house. My server told me for the spicy they actually infuse chili flakes into the dough & I thought that was pretty cool. The broth is spicy too but also very flavorful not just hot for no reason. The pork is grilled so it's not too wiggly & has a nice char which is good since it becomes submerged. Though the pork is nice, I personally think adding a side of chicken katsu is oh so necessary. The way the breading takes on the broth but still adds a little crunch, I just love it. I could honestly eat at least two bowls but I try to take it easy  \n\nI've been a moscow mule girl for a couple years so I like to think I have a really good handle on what's what in that category. Hajime has one of the absolute best I've ever tried. Turns out all the ingredients are imported & they include sake. It still has that crispy/spicy ginger taste I love but also incorporates hints of citrus. I went ahead & had two  \nThe next time you're in the mood for ramen you have to try this spot & I'm sure it will become an instant fave for you too.",

                "text": "In a very short time, i've been to Hajime on three separate occasions, and each time I left I was very satisfied!  The crazy thing is we've lived within minutes of Hajime for 7 months and only recently discovered this place!\n\nFor our latest visit, there was a group of 4 of us, and we were seated quickly.  Staff were (and always have been) super helpful, both on suggestions and with any allergies at the table regarding what to try or what to remove from the dish.  We ordered the following for the last visit:\n\nSteamed Edamame ($4)\nHoney Miso Ramen ($11)\nTonkotsu Ramen ($11)\nYaki Gyoza ($7)\nHirata Bun ($3)\nKarage Bun ($5)\n\nI also used the yelp check in deal to get a free topping for my ramen.  I ordered their Kakuni topping ($3 without a check in deal)\n\nThe Steamed edamame came out first and these are pretty standard.  Well seasoned, steamed nicely and really fresh.  If you like edamame, you know what you have in this.\n\nYaki Gyoza came out next and were shared between four of us.  Yaki Gyoza are steamed pork dumplings with mushroom, onions, scallions and their gyoza sauce.  Sadly I tried this at the end of the evening when it was cold, so this was just okay to me.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy them though.  This was my least favorite dish.\n\nBoth the Hirata and Karage buns came out after the ramen, but they were a welcome addition.  The Karage bun is fried chicken with spicy mayo and a sweet sauce.  Guys the chicken was NICE!  I was definitely a fan of this.  The Hirata bun is a pulled pork bun with onion, mayo and scallions.  This bun was also really good with a nice sauce and tender meat.  Both buns were a hit for me.\n\nFinally the ramen...I ordered this evening the Honey miso, but I have ordered their tonkotsu and spicy ramen.  I love the broth here, including the honey miso, which I thought would be off puttingly sweet.  No, it was just faint enough to take the salty edge off.  Very nice, guys!  The portion sizes are pretty good with these bowls, and they actually do listen to you if you ask to have something removed due to allergies or personal taste.\n\nThe add on Kakuni topping was nice and had nice flavor, but I really don't know that I would have paid $3 to add it on.  Still, very nice that they're yelp friendly and accept this deal.  Definitely redeem this and tell them when you're ordering that you want to use the deal!\n\nWhile I was happy with all of their sides, here's the thing...The edamame came out and less than 5 minutes later the ramen hit the table.  I'm not saying to not order any sides.  What I am saying is if you order something to hold you over until the main course shows, don't...because they get their ramen out to you FAST!\n\nLocated in the shopping center anchored by publix, Hajime has shared parking, and while the parking near hajime can be a challenge to find spots, you will never be without a parking spot.  You just may have to walk a bit.\n\nMultiple exits are here on either Cheshire bridge road or Lindberg, so you wont have a problem getting out.\n\nI've been pleasantly surprised with Hajime, love the customer service and enjoy the food.  I already know i'll be back for lunch, for dinner, and all meals in between.  If you're in the area, it may be worth your time!",

Modern looking from the inside and sort of industrial modern looking inside.  \n\nWe came on Easter Sunday for lunch. It was not crowded and we were seated immediately. Big menu featuring mostly ramen, appetizers and rice bowls. \n\nI opted for the vegetarian ramen and my partner had a rice bowl with chicken. We had water to drink. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes our food arrived. My ramen was pretty colorful, spring onion corn and spinach. The noodles were green, so I assume they were kale ramen noodles, because I saw something about kale noodles on the menu. My partner's food came in a small bowl with a sauced chicken on top. \n\nMy ramen was OK, a little bland but I ate it. Next time I will ask for some spicy noodles. My partner liked his chicken. \n\nOverall, OK food, great service.",

But recently, I was surprisingly satisfied at my experience. \n\nWe went for a late lunch so the restaurant was pretty empty and close to closing for preparation for the dinner service. We shared a combo of noodles and rice, which is a good deal for two who weren't particularly hungry. \n\nThe Tonkotsu Ramen wasn't as salty as the last time I ordered it. Rather, it was much more reserved in sodium but not lacking in flavor. The broth was rich and flavorful. The noodles were fine - we also asked for a kaedama, although we may not have needed it. The Chashu Don wasn't as insta-worthy as I hoped. The pork was pretty good, similar to the Chashu found on the ramen. A little too much sauce but easily fixed by removing maybe 1/4 of it. The scallion offset the heaviness of the aioli/sauce. \n\nWhat is most frustrating to me is the lack of consistency. I prefer not to have to re-write a review every time I eat here! Hajime has/had so much potential - I hope they will continue to take the constructive criticism, focus on the minor issues that could become big problems and stabilize the ups and downs.",

There was no wait, so we were seated right away. As we were dining some new diners trickled in as well but it was never packed.\n\nFirst thing that caught my eye was that they made noodles on site! Brownie points for them! Not a lot of places do that, even the authentic ones; most of them contract it out to a noodle maker. Since they make it on site, you can swap out regular noodles with spinach noodles or spicy noodles.\n\nFor my visit, I went with the spicy miso ramen. If you check in, you also get an extra topping so I went with spicy cod roe. Overall, my ramen was pretty tasty. The noodles definitely latched on to the broth which made it savory. Mine wasn't spicy enough so I asked for their chili oil.\n\nMy friends ordered the regular tonkotsu ramen and the spicy tonkotsu. I tasted my friend's broth and thought the spicy tonkotsu was more flavorful, so I wish I ordered that one instead.\n\n$1.50 bottled Asahi and Kirin! What more can you ask for?",

I've seen this restaurant many times when I dined at Rain Thai and Sushi Bar and have had this place bookmarked for a long time. I finally decided to check it out after a work function last night. We came in around 8:30 pm on a Thursday. From the outside, I thought Hajime would be a small, intimate type of restaurant. But I was surprised walking in. The restaurant was well-lit and unpolished. I think they were going for that rustic warehouse-type of feeling I guess? I wasn't really feeling it. \n\nThe staff was great! Super attentive and quick to get our orders. Being that it was our first time, they were really helpful giving us recommendations based on what we liked. \n\n*Seafood Ramen ($13): Has seafood broth, seaweed, squid, shrimp, scallop, white onion, sesame, shrimp oil and scallions. This was delicious! I ordered an extra egg (+$2). I don't remember seeing any squid in my soup however, I got around 6 whole shrimps. It's very tasty! If you love seafood, I'd highly recommend this one. \n\nThis was a super quick dinner so I didn't get to try much. I hear the beer here is only $1.50 for those interested. Make sure to check in on Yelp for your free topping!\n\nWould I come back? Maybe if I was craving for Japanese ramen. It was good, but not great.",
