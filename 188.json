The only problem is that their event hall is really small and long\n\n2) Service 5/5: The service was great and the staff their helped with the menu and suggestions\n\n3) Food 4/5: We ordered different courses and here is the summary of our experience\n\na) Crab Rangoon: It was crispy and tasty and we also liked the sauce with it\nb) Pad Thai with chicken: I liked the taste and the quantity and we had some leftovers to take home.\nc) Masaman curry: The masaman curry portion was huge but it was a little too sweet to my liking\n\n4) Value for money 4/5: It is not the cheapest place but also it is in Buckhead so if money is not a concern, this is a place to try.\n\nOverall, worth a try if you like that food and money is not a concern.",

Though a touch salty with the Noodle dish.\nNoodles offered plenty to eat while the Shrimp Curry left me wanting a bit more but we shared so it all worked out! .\nI would definitely go back as their private room looks super nice with all the decorations and huge table for a group.",

I started with the tofu pad Thai and it was a great portion. Plenty of spongy tofu and noodles the only thing I wanted more of was veggies. It was flavorful and the noodles were cooked well.\nI also tried the green curry with vegetables level 3 spicy and it was SPICY! Green curry has a kick anyway but I added coconut milk to it and that did the trick it was delish.I had leftover sauce and made some more veggies and had a second dinner that week.  I also ordered the roti slices and I wish they would have gave a bit more for the price. I Highly recommend nonetheless.",

When it came to ordering, we stuck to trying a bunch of their signature cocktails and appetizers.\n\nThe fried wings were our favorite. We ended up ordering them three times, we also had the spring rolls as well as the crab Rangoon. Everything was really good, but there's no bearing those fried wings! An added bonus is that they already came all flat !!\n\nWe sat at the bar and service was relatively quick on everything that we had, the bartender was pretty busy being that it was Friday night, but he did check in with us a ton of times to make sure that we were OK and was really good when it came to recommendations on the drinks. We had the Pattaya punch, Bangkok mule, and lychee martini, which Yum to say the least. \n\nDefinitely a space for a Instagram of all photos and my personal favorite a great view of the playoff game :))))))",

        "text": "Bangkok Stations was amazing. The experience was very pleasant and the food was amazing. A friend and I went to catch up and almost ended up sampling the whole menu. Each items we ordered had so much flavor. This is now one of my favorite Thai restaurants. I ordered the shrimp basil rice and added chicken. It was so delicious. My friend ordered the crab Rangoon appetizers and those little gems were so creamy and the dipping sauce paired really nice with it as well. We ended up getting the coconut cake for the table and my oh my. The cake had a vanilla base with a hint of coconut. It wasn't overwhelming at all. They made me a believer because I normally despise coconut cake because it always has a funny taste to me but they did a great job with everything. I will definitely be going back ! Also, parking is in the lower deck and is free so that's another added bonus.",

From what I've tried I think I enjoy the pad thai the most. I normally love a whole fried fish but they serve theirs by taking the fish off the bone and serving it in nugget pieces. I know a lot of people are afraid of the bones when eating a whole fish but served this way I got less fish and more breading. Regardless, I think this is a nice option for Thai in the area at a decent price but I wouldn't order the fish again.",

Bangkok station is close to the Buckhead, Village and Atlanta. I had no idea this restaurant was here, and I think I will be returning! my sisters, and I wanted to make the most of canceled flights and came here for our dinner, and we were not disappointed. We ordered a variety of things. We shared a soup, which was so well presented with a burning flame in the middle and was kept hot throughout the time we enjoyed it. We also ordered softshell, crab salad, two hole squares, the land and ocean, which is a chef inspired dish that you cannot make changes to, which we didn't mind because it was delicious as well. Everything was so flavorful, and, they hit the mark on every single dish. There wasn't anything that we wanted to return, our service was lovely, and we ordered drinks. I believe my sister ordered a hot toddy, one of my other sisters, ordered a frozen, piña colada, drink, and I ordered a Hot sake. Lovely service, lovely people, great ambience of the restaurant and I can't wait to come back!\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this restaurant four stars and not five is because it is super drafty in here. The nicer tables in my opinion are close to the windows, and there is a breeze that whistles through the walls and had us freezing LOL they did have space heaters around the restaurant, but they were not pumping enough to ignore the cold coming off of the walls unfortunately. There were some pillows for you to place at your back, but it was just so cold. Our feet were frozen throughout the whole night.",

I also tried the three flavor fried red snapper and boy do they make a flavorful fried red snapper. I can't wait to comeback for it again. I also enjoyed the heat  from the green curry with salmon dish. \n\nI recommend you come directly after work for a good relaxing experience.",

My boyfriend ordered the cashew pri pok with chicken. We never had this dish before so we don't know whether it was good or bad, only complaint is that it was kind of cold. I had the\nPad thai moo thod, which is pad thai with fried fatty pork. It was good, but it wasnt really great. The peanut chunks were a bit too powdery and i almost choked on it though. The calamari appetizer was also alright and it came with a yummy sweet pineapple sauce, which also paired well with my fried pork. I think it would be a nice addition to have the dipping sauce with the pork.",

Eating at this restaurant made me feel I was back in Thailand.  Give them a try. You can't go wrong!  I had the fried snapper. If you order that, ask for a side of their yellow curry to pour over the fish.  So so good!",

I don't know if the kitchen staff has changed or management has, but my orders are usually made wrong, missing the specified spice level or very small portions clumped together.

I'm not asking for a boat load of food, but the amount of food received does not match the price. I will not order from here again. You get way less than what you pay for. I ordered the chicken coconut soup, chicken larb and the papaya salad.  You barely get any soup. Imagine the smallest container possible with barely anything in it but broth. The chicken larb was super salty! The papaya salad might as well have been non-existent because the tray contained half a cabbage in it and a cup of papaya salad. Very disappointed in how a business would operate this way. On Uber eats, they are under this business name and listed as \"Eat Thai\", so diners beware.",

We ordered 3 items - BKK Seafood Hotpot, Thai Papaya Salad, and Muk Yang (char-grilled whole octopus, which is a Thai Seafood festival special this year) - and loved every single dish.\n\nWhere to start, I believe the devil is in the detail when it comes to a good dinning experience, and they have nailed the detail. The Seafood hotpot was FILLED with seafood, and the papaya salad was FRESH down to the garnishing carrots (yes, I ate that too, b/c it was THAT good). The Muk Yang was tender and just the right chewy-ness, which is hard to say when you take a gamble and order octopus at many restaurants. But what surprised and delighted me was the side fried rice that came with the octopus, it was THE BEST FRIED rice I had since I came to the State; it had WOK HAY.\n\n10/10 food and atmosphere, they are a bit short-staffed but still tries their best to take care of customers. I am definitely coming back again.",

Our first experience was so excellent and our server Pei (I hope I'm spelling that right) was so lovely and helpful. And made some mean cocktails! \n\nIt was enough for us to choose Bangkok Station for our wedding dinner celebration. We had a small court ceremony with family, and wanted to keep the dinner similar - private, joyful, and peaceful. And the private dining room here is just that - big enough for maybe 15 people or more, we were only 5, but the manager (who is always super nice) arranged it so beautifully. I wish I could share more pictures but my family's in all of them! \n\nThe food was just delicious. No two ways about it. We ordered a LOT of food. Leftovers lasted for two more meals. The red snapper special was awesome, as you can see in the picture. I had the crying tiger steak special myself, and fully intend to order that again the next time I visit. \n\nThe appetizers are awesome. And there's a good balance between authentic Thai, and some slightly American-friendly versions too. \n\nThe fact that they offer \"Thai-hot\" as a spice level was very welcome for my Indian family and their over-stimulated taste buds. \n\nAnother star of the experience was our server Tony. He was just great. There when we needed him, gone when we didn't. Polite, helpful, I've got no notes for him. \n\nHighly recommended to anyone in the mood for some damn good Thai food.",

Ridiculous!!\nI ordered spice level 3 out of 5 and it was over the spicy.\nAlso ordered basil roll that totally unraveled, when I opened it, it looked like  a salad with absolutely no flavor.\nOverpriced and poor execution.\nSave you time and miney.",

The food came out so quick and hot and Jesus everything was so so good. We had a picky eater in the group and she liked everything that was brought out. I will say one thing is that for it to be slow; service could be better. Our server was talking on the side with a coworker oat of our visit. He was super nice and sweet though. I would recommend be a little more attentive. Other than that everything was great even valet. Until next time!!! Peace",
