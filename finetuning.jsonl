If you go  go for the fried chicken.    Cool atmosphere with two floor converted home.  Loved the look and feel.    The meal was fantastic thanks to the star of the show  the fried chicken.  So good.  My meal with the waffle was tasty.  However  I tasted the collard greens  and wow  so good.  That was the better meal  for sure.  If you go  go for that!  Loved it.  Give them a try."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

I wish I could recall our servers name bc he was absolutely outstanding. He was very helpful  prompt and completely came through with the best recommendations.  We ordered the fried green tomatoes for an appy along with our cocktails. My husband got an old fashioned and I got a pink daisy. Both were chefs kiss.  For our entree  I ordered the pork chop that had a side of the brussel sprouts. 9/10. The Brussels themselves were a 10/10.  My husband got the fried chicken and he voted it a 9/10.  Then the sweet waiter brought us a complimentary dessert banana pudding trifle. How nice!   The ambiance was nice. Lively  but also romantic.   Def recommend"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

Our server talked up the great service he was going to provide but it turned out to be not all that great.  Forgotten items   very late deliveries of condiments   confusion of the interuptive food runner  etc.   We ordered lots of appetizers and some were good   some were blah.    I got the Chicken Fried Chicken which was told to be one of the best items on the menu.   It was a huge disappointment.   My guess is that the white gravy sat on the chicken for a long time before being brought to me and made the coating soggy.  My side of collard greens and side of sweet potato souflee were the highlight of my entire experience.    Nobody raved over their meals which tells me that everyone was probably underwhelmed.   We got a laugh at the cinnamon rolls dessert.  Don't do it.   The part that sucked the most was going back to the cars afterwards   in their parking lot   and finding that 3 or 4 cars had their windows smashed.  Not our cars luckily but that sure sucks for those other people.   The next day   half of our group had lunch at Cracker Barrel and they alled seemed to agree that the Cracker Barrel meal was superior to the Mary Mac's Tea Room meal.  That's sad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

When coming to a city I throughly believe in heading to the spot that have survived the test of time. The mood here is old school atlanta and a home feel. All the dining rooms feel like you are being greeted by Southern hospitality. The ultimate welcome is the warm biscuits and cornbread.   We tried the fried chicken  Mac and cheese  collard greens  sweet potato  rice and gravy  cabbage and broccoli souffle. As far as soul food good this leaves much to be desired. Its a good meal but nothing left me wowed. The mark of a good home cooked meal is how flavorful your side dishes are and for me these fell a little flat.   I suggest giving it a try to form your opinion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

The entire menu is pretty much every southern comfort food you could think of - fried chicken  fried shrimp  grits  collard greens  peach cobbler etc. I got the fried chicken with 2 sides of mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. The portions were pretty large  and the chicken was cooked well. I recommend the banana pudding for dessert:)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

We were told to come for the burgers- they were okay. Drinks were basic- the server kept referring to the place as \"a dive.\" But the fried pickles were excellent. I did find it odd that my group (3 minorities) were sat upstairs along with 3 other groups of minorities. When I used the washroom there was 1 black couple in the main seating area- coincidental  perhaps?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Perhaps it's because of the holiday but..... eat snacks before you go if this is normal.  Once the food finally arrives  it's ok but not particularly memorable. Duck is tender and juicy  but put something else on the fork  like the butternut squash pur√©e  and that other thing is the only flavor that comes through.  Bland but well cooked is how I would describe the meal  including dessert.   If you want Just drinks and appetizers-- book an igloo  cozy warmth with your friends can be a good time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}
