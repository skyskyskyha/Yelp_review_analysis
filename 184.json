The highlight, of course, was the chicken - it lived up to the hype with a deliciously spicy kick that set it apart from your average fried chicken. I appreciated how accommodating they were with substitutions, allowing us to swap sides to our preference. Opted for the 2-piece dark meat plate, and it was a perfect choice. Definitely planning a return visit the next time I'm in Atlanta. Highly recommend for anyone looking for top-notch fried chicken with a unique twist!",

They make this a sit down place where you wait to be seated but the sign where you wait at and the counter they tell you where to sit at are very far away so it's doesn't really feel like a sit down place.  Some of the tables hadn't been wiped yet so we picked one that seemed clean.  They're famous for their fried chicken so that's what we got!  The fried chicken was a little spicy on the outside but the two dark meat chicken pieces I got were very tender and indeed very crunchy.  I also got a side of collared greens which were good too.  Prices are around $8 for a two piece chicken meal on top of a piece of bread (didn't really understand how to eat it with the bread so just ate it like a side piece), and around $3 for each side.  They also have platters that already come with sides.",

The service was quick and friendly - which we really appreciated as we had a few questions (and can tell the place was starting to get busy). \n\nNow that chicken was some of the best we ever had! Perfect crunch and spice to all of the pieces - my favorite was the thigh, but those wings were also top 5 with the best I've had. The fries were just OK (and would probably do a different side next time). Was also super reasonably priced too. \n\nI'd def go back to Gus's next time I find myself in Atlanta!",

I had the 3 piece dark plate with leg and thigh and for my sides I ordered baked beans and Mac and cheese. The baked beans were the best I've ever had and the Mac n cheese was top notch too.\nMy husband also had the 3 piece dark but he had the fries. He also loved the chicken (especially the crispiness and the spice). The only thing he missed was peach cobbler.\nOverall it was great food with friendly service and a clean environment.",

        "text": "This restaurant is such a gem.  We came here after the SEC Championship game, so it was very busy!  But the line moved quickly to get seated.  Plus there was an option to order takeout instead.  Our waiter was incredibly friendly.\n\nWe each ordered fried chicken platters (2 dark pieces for me, half chicken for my companion), and we were pleased to find out you could substitute the prefixed sides for others from their menu.  The meals come with baked beans, cole slaw, and a piece of white bread.  We ended up switching out one of those sides each for the potato salad.  And to share, we got the macaroni and cheese.  It was all delicious!  The fried chicken was made just the way it should be - perfect amount of batter, crispy and not soggy with grease. \n\nAfter we ate, we also got pie.  Now, we were hoping to try either their sweet potato or pecan pie, but they were sold out.  Our waiter suggested the chess pie, and we decided to give it a go!  It was so good!  It's basically a vanilla custard type flavor, and I'm so glad we tried it.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Gus' and hope to come back one day!  The food was great and so was the service.",

        "text": "For the record, I need you to understand the level of excitement that came over me at the fact that I was finally able to try Gus's!\n\nI have a girlfriend who has told me on more than one occasion that Gus's was the best fried chicken she has ever had in her life. As such, I had to go! \n\nAfter years of saying \"I'm going\" I was finally able to make my way in. I love that there is parking directly across the street from the building. Upon walking in I was drawn to the cafe style setup presented. It looks like a weekday cafe mixed with a small family restaurant. Great aesthetic for a friend lunch or personal meal. \n\nWe were seated upon entry and greeted by our waitress Nicole. Nicole walked over very upbeat and all smiles. She was super friendly and instantly connected with us as we laughed and joked as we discussed our drink choices. Note to Management, Nicole's service was above standard and worth recognition. \n\nI decided on a Sweet Tea and the 2 Piece. For the record they do NOT have cornbread. Nicole comforted me by letting me know I wasn't alone in my thoughts that cornbread would be on the menu. LoL!\n\nThe Sweet Tea was Southern Sweet Goodness and exactly what I needed on a warm Spring Day. As I sit here and write this I want some more. LoL!!\n\nThe chicken was a true experience. Crunchy on the outside. Moist and meaty on the inside. Well seasoned with a noticeable blend of flavor on the meat as well as in the batter along with being perfectly cooked. This 2 piece hit the spot in the exact way that was needed at the moment. \n\nI will admit, when it comes to GREAT Fried Chicken, Gus's has made its way to my Top 10 List!!!  \n\nIf you are near a Gus's I suggest you make it a point to stop in and grab you an order. Make sure to sit down before taking a bite as it will cause a sensation of flavor-goodness throughout your whole body. HaHa!!",

We ordered a 2 piece dark and a 2 piece white and all 4 different pieces were hot, juicy, flavorful, crispy and oh just ever so slightly spicy.  Sacrilege, I know, but sometimes I like to dip my fried chicken into ketchup/hot sauce.  This chicken does not need that.  It's so flavorful and juicy, it really doesn't need an accompaniment.  I wish Gus's were in Las Vegas, I'd get a bucket a week.\n\nThe sides were ok.  The coleslaw was good but very sweet and over-dressed.  The greens were ok but lacked any depth of flavor.  The baked beans were very good.  I have never had such a tomato heavy base baked bean with bell peppers.  Really, really good.  \n\nThe service in this place is a little lackluster.  There seemed to be a lot of servers (I counted 5 I think) but they seem to be more involved with checking their phones and gossiping than anything else.  That being said, our server did check up on us at least once so I can't really complain.  Our table was sticky and when our server put our utensils down, she grabbed a napkin, put that down first, then put our napkins and silverware on said napkin.  It's like she knew the table was dirty, which I definitely didn't like.  Instead of phones, maybe wipe down some tables?",

        "text": "Out-of-this-world fried chicken from Tennessee! \n\nI love fried chicken. So naturally, my interest was piqued when I found this place in Atlanta serving \"world famous\" fried chicken!\n\nGus's is a chain originally from Tennessee. It started out as a small family business some 60 years ago, & has since grown to multiple locations across 14 states. \n\nChicken:\n- Gus's World Famous Hot & Spicy Fried Chicken (10-piece assortment)\n- Tenders (x2)\n\nSides: \n- Slaw\n- Mac & Cheese \n- Greens\n- Potato Salad \n- Baked Beans\n\nStarters:\n- Fried Okra \n- Fried Pickle Spears\n- Fried Green Tomatoes\n\nDrinks:\n- IBC Root Beer Float \n- Diet Coke \n\nThe fried chicken was exceptional. It was so tender & juicy on the inside, while perfectly crispy on the outside. Even parts that you'd expect to be tougher usually (like the thigh) were tender & juicy too! That's because they marinate all their chicken for 24 hours beforehand! What's even more amazing is that the spiciness was so sublime, you could enjoy the spicy taste without having your entire mouth burn up! \n\nThe fried starters were surprisingly tasty too. I loved the okra & the green tomato. The ranch dips were a perfect pairing.\n\nThe sides were pretty decent, of which my faves were house-made potato salad & slaw. \n\nThe IBC Root Beer Float was so creamy & refreshing! Simply heaven. The drinks come in a cute souvenir cup you can take home too!\n\nOverall, we were very impressed with our meal at Gus's. Their fried chicken is definitely some of the best we've ever had!",

        "text": "Omg. Y'all, this is some good chicken. I want to curse so badly to get my point across but this is a family-friendly app, so let me get myself in order. But baby! Who knew?! I guess all of you giving rave reviews knew, but why didn't y'all tell me, your friend?! Smh. Well, the secrets out and I now know where to get some amazinggg fried chicken in Atlanta. \n\nSo if you've read any of my reviews, you'll see that I'm a frequent solo diner and a major fan of takeout. Sometimes getting all dolled up and going out in ATL traffic just isn't the move but a girls gotta eat! So I hop on a delivery app and order a meal with a click. And lucky me, I stumbled upon Gus's. I love myself some fried chicken and/or hot wings, always a great plan. But you can't always find exceptional fried chicken sometimes, but I have!\n\nMy go-to is the three piece dark combo. When I ordered it for the first time, I expected to need hot sauce but not at all! Omg it was so juicy! The skin was so crisp but it was all so flavorful, and it had a kick too! I'm a spicy dark kinda gal and these were fireeeee, no hot sauce needed. My first set of sides were greens and Mac & cheese, and honestly, not the move. The Mac seemed like fancy Kraft and the greens were just okay, but my mama makes the best greens so I'm bias lol. But I've tried the fries and the baked beans as well and they were delicious! The fries were nicely seasoned and the beans weren't too sweet, but flavorful. As I write this, I'm plotting on my leftovers in the kitchen lol. \n\nDefinitely my go-to fried chicken spot going forward!",

My biggest gripe were the sides -- beans were good but not great and the cole slaw was my least favorite thing I had this whole trip. Come for the chicken, but you can probably skip the sides.",

When we got done eating, I asked her to take them off of our check because they never arrived....she seemed shock but eagerly agreed to take them off. \n\nWe proceeded to leave, and I don't know who the gentleman was, but he seemed to be a manager, owner, someone...well he came after us and offered us the tomatoes stating that we must've had a taste for them since we ordered them, and our waitress just didn't realize they'd been prepared. \n\nThat was such a pleasant surprise and very nice gesture! I'm glad we tipped her well, despite the fgt's issue. This is the reason I've rated them a 5 and not 4!!! That's superb customer service! \n\nSorry no pics of our lunch, just got caught up and immediately started eating!",

        "text": "Gus' is definitely a solid restaurant if you have a hankering for fried chicken. It is seasoned very well. No one wants bland fried chicken.  Our server was kind and attentive, keeping in mind we roll deep, so that can be an issue with big parties. Not here though, no complaints regarding the service. It's a nice vibe, you can watch sports and enjoy your meal. I had the fried wings with Mac and cheese and fried okra. The fried okra was absolutely delicious, you can't go wrong with that. That Mac and cheese needs some work, not bad, but certainly not southern style, it's giving stouffer's with some shredded cheese on top. \n\nOverall, it's a decent restaurant and I would recommend if you are downtown.",

        "text": "Probably one of the better restaurants in downtown! I'm visiting for work but determined to squeeze some time in for local eats that aren't in California. Of the places (downtown) I've tried so far, Gus's easily beats the rest out.\n\nFor COVID safety measures, some staff wear masks. Inside is casual and humble, a very Southern homestyle feel. I believe this is a part of the food court in an adjacent mall, but also accessible from the side street. I walked in on a Sunday afternoon and was seated immediately. Staff are attentive and courteous-- kindly gave recommendations when I asked. I appreciate that their menu is short and simple, keeping straight to the basics.\n\n3 PIECE DARK: Expertly fried chicken-- definitely steps up from your average chicken chain. Batter is thin, light, and crispy, seasoned with a light spice to complement the tender, juicy meat. Sits on top of a piece of white bread, but not greasy at all.\n\nBAKED BEANS: Just the right balance of sweet and savory to whet your appetite. I usually don't like any type of beans, but these were a nice surprise!\n\nCOLLARD GREENS: Average. They're fine. A little bland compared to everything else, but still tasty.\n\nCOLESLAW: Also pretty standard mayo-based slaw.\n\nI think I made the error of catching up on my Yelp reviews while I was here-- around the end of my meal, my server saw that I was giving a 2 star (this was for another business) and immediately started being more cold to me LOL. Hopefully this review shows that I had a good time after all :')",

The girl who seated us and our server were really awesome and it is a huge place with lots of tables. \n\nWe were a party of 4, so 2 ordered special for the day with 4 leg pieces and 2 sides and 2 of us went a la cart with tenders and sides. Fries, okra fries, Mac n Cheese were really good. We even ordered the pecan pie - delicious..\n\nNow for the cons - the tenders were over cooked and a bit rubbery. When the bill came, we noticed that they had charged us for the regular price for the 2 specials. Thankfully we noticed it and it was rectified. They also charge for the extra sauce.\n\nOnce again, I am not as excited about fried chicken options in Atlanta and keep comparing to the humble but mighty Chick-fil-a who deliver quality fried chicken with no up-charge for sauce and have amazing service and quality every time. \n\nOne more time",

        "text": "I first had Gus' in Memphis and it was absolutely delicious. Even though it was cold cause it was an hour later as I ate it in my hotel bed. I was elated when I learned that they had two locations in the atlanta area, one of them only 20 minutes from me. I order from here maybe every other month when I get a fried chicken craving (I don't eat meat regularly) and it never disappoints. I never had ordered anything except the chicken and sweet tea - both of which are good. The chicken skin is crispy, the meat itself is well flavored, and it passed the fried chicken test of being delicious while cold. I love this place and hope they never close.",

The potato salad, and coleslaw were oversaturated with sugar to mask the poor taste. The chicken was old, poorly seasoned. The so called spice was weak and had an after taste!! The mac and cheese rate a 2 on a 10 point scale.",

        "text": "Walking distance from the Atlanta Marriott Marquis. Didn't eat in, got it to-go to take back to the hotel. I ordered wings, greens and Mac & cheese. Hubby had 2pc dark with greens and beans. Very good, cooked fresh to order, not dry or overcooked. Green were delicious and the Mac & cheese was okay, but probably wouldn't order again- I'm picky about my Mac and cheese, I'm not a cheese sauce or velvetta fan.\n\nWhile waiting for our order there were a stream of people coming in to either place an order or picking up their call in order. FYI, I don't use or like any hot sauce, because I believe anything that's cooked right you don't need a sauce to change the flavor. I appreciated the little kick the chicken had, seasoning was on point.",

The chicken was hot and juicy. Had a little spice to it. Mac and cheese was delicious. It was some of the best fried okra I've ever had. We also ordered some pie. We ordered chocolate, sweet potato and         All of the were soooo good. Service was good. If I'm ever back here I'll definitely be going back.",
