        "text": "I live close enough to walk to this shopping center, so I was really excited when Roshambo opened. The vibe inside is cozy, but also classy. My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's Day last year and it was perfectly appropriate for a nice date night. \n\nThe service is great. We usually sit at the bar and the bartenders have always been friendly, polite and knowledgeable. Definitely no complaints there! \n\nI'd say the food is *fine*. Good menu of diverse items and there's always something that I want to try, but nothing that I've eaten here really left such an impression on me that I went rushing back for more. The price point is in line with Atlanta restaurants...not exactly cheap. However, I did take off one star because on our most recent trip there, I got the Penne with Sausage and Peppers and that dish was memorable for being probably one of the worst things I've eaten in a restaurant. My boyfriend and I got a plate to share and between us, we couldn't eat the whole thing. The bartender noticed us picking at it and asked what was wrong. It had NO seasoning whatsoever. Even the sausage just tasted like unseasoned ground meat. To her credit, she kindly offered to bring us another one which we declined. We added salt but that didn't help and we ended up leaving half the dish uneaten. \n\nI'll definitely be back because I think this is a lovely spot with good cocktails and a pleasant vibe but I'm a little scared to spend another $25 on a dish that I can't even eat a quarter of.",

The restaurant had a party hat and a sweet little card on the table for her when we got there, which was such a nice touch! Dominic was our waiter and he was fabulous! \"The Diner's Diner\" was really misleading for me--without looking at pictures beforehand, I was expecting old-fashioned red booths and aluminum tables, but it was actually super upscale and nice inside.\n\nHere's what I had:\n- Cinnamon Monkey Bread ($9): OMG. I would go back just for this.\n- Disco Tots ($14): Decent.\n- Short Rib Hash ($24): This had good taste, but was missing crunch. I think it would've been better if the potatoes had been tater tots instead. I also asked for eggs over medium, but they came hard (not pictured--my friend's over easy eggs are pictured).\n\nFantastic service. Beautiful restaurant. Good food at a high price point.",

The ambience is actually quite elevated for a diner and they have a beautiful bar and fun little 2 person booths. The first time I came here was with a friend for happy hour (3-6pm) and the deals were amazing! Most of the cocktails were $10, I got an espresso martini and it was delicious. We also got oysters which were $10 per half dozen during happy hour. My friend got raw oysters and I got the charbroiled, which had all the good stuff (butter and bacon!). It's nice that the charbroiled oysters were included in the special since they usually aren't at other restaurants. \n\nI brought another friend here and we started with the crab rangoon dip ($14). As a crab rangoon enthusiast, this was everything I could have wanted! It came warm and melty with fried wonton chips. We were not super hungry, so we split the faux cheval burger ($19) and upgraded to disco tots. Our server knew we wanted to split the burger and brought it out to us cut in half on separate plates, which was very thoughtful. Everything was delicious, but I do feel like the price point is a little high if not coming for happy hour.",

        "text": "Chic upscale diner with a beautiful atmosphere. \n\nService: I came twice within 2 weeks. The first time I was blown away with the impeccable service from both my waitress & bartender. Unfortunately, I failed to get their names :(... \n\nFood: I came on a Thursday & the meal of the day was they Spicy Crab Spaghettini. This dish was AMAZING & full of flavor. I also shared the disco tots, hushpuppies, fish tacos & the regular biscuit. The 2nd time I ordered the pasta & disco tots again. We also tried the Nashville Hot Chicken Biscuit. I have to admit that the disco tots & Spicy Crab Spaghettini weren't as tasty as the first time. It was clear that the chef was different. The tots barely had the delicious pimento cheese sauce on them so they were dry. The pasta was on the drier side as well. I was very disappointed. I would not reccomend the hushpuppies at all. They had no flavor at ALL. The aoili served with them was great, so order a side to dip your tots in. The Nashville hot chicken biscuit was nothing to write home about either. I would go back to try the pasta again. \n\nDrinks: Very good. All cocktails are $10 during happy hour\n\nParking: Ample. It's in a strip plaza\n\nOverall, my experience was good. The restaurant is very aesthetic & the happy hour is very reasonable.",

        "text": "It was nice to try this newer restaurant in the Peachtree Battle area. We had reservations, and a majority of tables were full on a Friday night. The space looks pretty modern and cool. Be sure to check out the cool tape wall on the way to the bathroom!\n\nAlthough they refer to themselves as a diner's diner - it was not what we expected. Our server let us know that they're in the process of changing concepts - that was pretty obvious; they'll need to figure out what they want to be. There was one basic breakfast dish on the menu, but otherwise very little diner vibes. \n\nThe food might be 4.5 stars on flavor. Our group tried a few things including the burger, winter kale salad, chicken parm, prime rib, and redfish (market fish) - as well as some cocktails and the skillet cookie. Everything was tasty. I enjoyed the salad but thought it could use a bit of nutty crunch or other texture. The burger was good albeit heavy on mayo. The fish and prime rib got great reviews from friends, the parm a bit less on sauce flavor. \n\nService was fine but nothing to blow me away. No refills on water, etc. and rarely checked in before we were done. But very friendly when interacting with us, so perhaps busy manning a lot of tables. There was a large private party, which slowed down food service as well. \n\nAll in all, would definitely return to try a few other dishes, and see how they find their identity too!",

        "text": "My sister and I decided to check out The Diner's Diner - Roshambo for their happy hour, which runs from Monday to Friday between 3-6 pm. The place caught my eye right away with its Atlanta-themed decor, featuring a mural of the cityscape on the right wall as you walk in. This mural is pretty unique, with three layers representing different snapshots taken from the Jackson Street Bridge on Freedom Parkway. The attention to detail was impressive.\n\nNow, let's talk about the happy hour menu - it's got a nice variety of options, and the best part is that everything is priced at $10 or under. They've got cocktails, wine, and beer on offer, so there's something for everyone. I decided to go with the jalapeño margarita, and they made it nice and spicy just the way I like it. It hit the spot.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the Nashville hot chicken biscuit, which came with pepper jack cheese, bourbon peach jam, chicken, house pickles, and shredded lettuce. It was really good. And the jalapeño cheddar hushpuppies with chili lime aioli were a tasty side.\n\nMy sister opted for the oysters and gave them a thumbs up.\n\nThey also have a free parking lot on site. \n\nThe restaurant had a cute and cozy vibe with some thoughtful touches, and the service was solid.\n\nAll in all, The Diner's Diner - Roshambo is a winner in my book. It combines a bit of Atlanta charm, a well-priced happy hour menu, and good service. Definitely worth a visit!",

        "text": "SO excited for this restaurant. Local Three is a favorite and when I saw this menu I knew this restaurant was going to be a new go to.  Stopped by for brunch and the atmosphere is great. They have a long bar, several \"high top\" booths next to the bar and then the regular seating.  MAKE A RESERVATION. It wasn't hard to book a reservation a day out, but we had previously tried to call day of and they were on a 3 hour wait. \n\nI love the menu, which is why it pains me to say I didn't LOVE my meal. We had the pigs in a blanket to start (good, but we were both not crazy about the pairing of the sauce & opted to eat plain) Husband had the shrimp and grits which he enjoyed and I had the eggs benedict. Unfortunately the hollandaise had so much lemon in it and was too bitter to enjoy. I did try to rescue the ham underneath but left feeling pretty hungry. \n\nI know hollandaise is hard to nail, so i'll probably head back for another meal to try something else.  Granted, I think there are only ~4 brunch entrees so I may have to come back for dinner instead.",

I had made one just in case.\n\nWe went here for brunch and were seated immediately. The decor in here is very quirky and well thought out. I will say the room we were seated in had a lot of sound being trapped in so it was kind of hard to hear. \n\nI ordered a coffee which was pretty decent and the grilled cheese with tomato soup. I enjoyed it but might have preferred a different bread. It's really nice that you can order from the breakfast lunch and dinner menu at any time. \n\nThe service is decent too, it took a little bit longer to get our check, but that was ok. I would come back to try some other things on the menu.",

        "text": "This is a new spot, been open since thanksgiving 2022. It's a chic diner that serves all day all menu (bfast, lunch and dinner) I needed something for Valentine's Day brunch without a pre fix menu and this place delivered! The ambience is super nice, with art reflecting ATL skyline. I love the theme and they also have a decor wall\nWith old cassette. The server was very enthusiastic and captured all the specials. The fish tacos and chicken pot pie were fantastic. Tuna poke crudo was a great appetizer. The lobster enchilada not so much and was steep at 50$ for the quality. It also could work on the presentation. The mimosa was served in a wine glass??? But the poncietta was great. \n3 stars as 2 out of our 5 dishes were subpar and not good at all.",

Met us with a lovely smile and made sure all our food came out on time \n\nWe were a party of five and had the bucket of chicken and bubbles and lots of apps. My recommendation  is to get one bucket. And eat the apps. It was worth it for a big party. It's a whole bird cut and and deep fried. Was more than enough! \n\nIt's only been open a couple of weeks. So go check it out!!",

        "text": "Came here for brunch with another Atlanta Yelp Elite as this place just recently opened. It's located in the Peachtree Battle shopping center with plenty of free parking. Beware, pulling up I was looking for a \"Roshambo\" sign, but it's rather signed \"Diner's Diner\". \n\nThe interior and aesthetic is stunning. Amazing vibes and so meticulously curated. It really doesn't fit the location and walking inside is a true surprise. We had a reservation and were seated quickly.\n\nI ordered the Double Stack Burger ($19) and my friend ordered the Four Cheese Grilled Cheese ($18). I really enjoyed my burger and it was juicy and delectable. The tots were plentiful and nice as they weren't your normal mass produced tater tots you get in the frozen section at Kroger, but still normal tots haha. My friend enjoyed her grilled cheese and soup as well.\n\nMaybe it was the location we were sitting in here that echoes or the company close by, but this place gets LOUD in the worst way possible. I don't fault the restaurant as pretty sure it was the table next by yelling. This could have been better handled by staff as I could barely hear my friend beside me. \n\nService was really good until we finished our meal and then it seemed like we could never flag down our waiter or see him? I guess this wasn't an issue, but we were ready to get our checks and head on out. BUT, we never felt rushed at all! Once we flagged him down, all was back on track.",

        "text": "We had a group reservation for 4 on a Sunday evening and as soon as we checked in l, we were seated.  The atmosphere of the new restaurant is very nice, it's well lit with a causal yet fine dining vibe.  There's plenty of booths and tables with dividers, as well as a bar with TVs, to not feel overcrowded.\nWe split the disco tots which were a fun twist with the melted pimento cheese.\nAll the entrees were a generous size and appropriately priced in my opinion, most of us didn't finish our plate.  I had the shrimp and grits which had a twist using hatch chiles which was delicious.\nThe wine/beer/cocktail menu reminds me of their other restaurants - they offer a wide variety of wines and handmade cocktails, with a few select beers.\nFinally, 5+ stars for service - they had ample staff to assist with refilling waters, taking away plates, and serving.  Everyone was very courteous!",

        "text": "My review is only for the bar and drinks, as that is all I had. A friend and I stopped here for a nightcap in July 2023. We picked a seat, and the friendly bar staff immediately greeted us. I absolutely loved the map on the mirror behind the bar. This place has a very elegant but comfortable feel; the barstools are super soft with backs, and there are two different height footrests. I get really annoyed when I get to a bar, and there's nothing to lean against, and there's no comfortable place to rest my feet.  \nThe restaurant is decorated with the Atlanta skyline on one wall, an honorary wall to the old Turtles record store, and many other pictures of moments in Atlanta's history. I liked everything I saw on the way to the bathroom so much that I was very tempted to walk around the whole restaurant so I wouldn't miss anything, but I decided not to since I needed to come back and try their food. \nWe enjoyed our first round so much that we had a second.  The bar has an outstanding selection of liquor, especially whiskey. My first drink was a Bee's Knees, which was perfectly balanced; if not made well, Bee's Knees are very sweet. My friend had the French 75, and she liked it so much that she had a second one. For my second drink, I had a NY sour, which is something that I've never tried before, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

The burger was well seasoned and the tots touched my soul. \n\nAlong with my entree I ordered a Bloody Mary which was properly spicy and flavorful. \n\nService was warm and attentive. The overall decor and vibe of the place is southern, yet modern with a splash of funk (you can spot random song lyrics through out the decor). Definitely a good spot for girls brunch.",

Some of the best fried chicken I've had in ATL, paired with some of amazing biscuits and sides. \n\nHow could I forget the drinks! Drinks are always pricy in Atlanta, but the Cosmo Pitcher is a solid deal. They also have a great Happy Hour selection, which is hard to find in Buckhead. \n\n10/10, no notes.

Having said that, the lady who checked on us at the end was extremely kind in giving us this notification. But seriously, someone give a heads up ahead of time.\n\nThe redfish was flavored perfectly and the accompanying sauce was nice but the grit cake fell flat. I get the containment that the grit cake provides but usually it ends up being a dense puck and underflavored. My friend had the pork which he devoured and we started with the brussels sprouts which were tasty.\n\nDrinks were good and the ambience was very nice. The menu looks great and I'll definitely be back to sample some more items, especially the fried chicken bucket.\n\nThe rest of the staff was equally hospitable which made for a pleasant evening.",

All of your favorite classics are right on the menu. (So no praying for a good Bee's Knees or Sazarac, they've got it mastered) \n\nMegan was the wonderful server that I mentioned earlier. Her energy is magnetic with a smile to match. She offered great service, recommendations and even took our picture! I'd come back just for her ! \n\nWe had the spinach and onion dip which tastes very very similar to the classic spinach and artichoke dip. Then we shared fish tacos and chicken parm.

Apparently it's pretty new and has breakfast food so I was excited to come and see what they had to offer.\n\nNot that many breakfast options so I ended up going  with the double stack burger. The portion size was good and the burger was quite juicy.\n\nThe service was pretty friendly although they weren't as informed about the menu options as I would've liked. Overall a great experience and I'd give them another try in the future.",

I told them a month before there would be at most 20 people. I was told conflicting info. \n\nThis was a gathering of parents from a school nearby, most live within 10 minutes of the restaurant and not to mention work nearby.

We always appreciate hearing from our guests, as it helps us improve our services and ensure the best possible experience for everyone.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the confusion surrounding your recent visit. We understand that large parties can be challenging to coordinate, and we sincerely apologize if there was any miscommunication about our Side Hustle minimums and needing a credit card to hold the reservation. We offered your group a much lower minimum for the night and when asked to put a credit card on file to hold the reservation were refused as well when that is a policy we have for taking the entire private dining room for an evening. Booking multiple reservations under false pretenses affects our ability to staff the restaurant accordingly as we aren't able to rotate and share reservations equally amongst our team.\n\nAt our restaurant, we have established these guidelines to ensure that we can provide the highest level of service and accommodate the needs of larger groups effectively,  including scheduling extra staff to efficiently serve larger groups. We strive to maintain a balance between catering to the unique needs of each guest and the operational requirements of our establishment. \nTo better address situations like this in the future, we will work on improving our communication with guests, especially when it comes to large party reservations. We aim to provide clear information about our policies and help guests understand the expectations to avoid any inconvenience and maintain the level of service we strive to provide to all our guests.  I would love to discuss further if you are willing. My email is Lindsay@roshamboatl.com. \n\nLindsay Ferdinand\nGeneral Manager",

        "text": "So me and Nancy decided to head to Atlanta for a nice couples trip and along our travels we decided to try Roshambo on a whim.  First we were greeted by a wonderful host by the name of James who was proudly wearing his Falcons jersey even though in Arlen, we live and breathe Dallas Cowboys.  He was probably the warmest and nicest host I have encountered in quite some time.  The last time I got greeted this nice was when Kahn and the Souphanousinphones thought I was moving out of my house.  Once we sat at our table we were then greeted with a helpful waitress and the whole time we were greeted with amazing 70s music that set the ambiance.  Also the cassette wall next to the bathroom was a great touch!  But then we start getting our food and the bread was amazing! Then I decided to get the shrimp and grits with pumpkin ( I know sounds a lil wonky)  which was different but familiar at the same time and very good.  Hank called me while I was in the restaurant and I told him he had to come, he then just kept talking my head off about Ladybird.  I always say the details of a restaurant matter and that was seen in the cleanliness of the bathroom and even their own branded plates which were amazing.  Ahhh dare I say is Roshambo one of the best restaurants in Atlanta.  Idk what restaurant could contend with them.  Between the warmth of the staff and the quality of the food it made me more satisfied than when Bobby eats a warm fruit pie.  I guess back to Arlen.....",

I'm ashamed to say that I have tried every appetizer on the menu but the spinach & artichoke dip and that's only because artichokes make the back of my throat itch.  I have the appetizers in order, starting with the most delicious, Jalapeno Cheddar Hushpuppies, Disco Tots, the broiled oyster and Brussel Sprouts.  The staple menu items that I would recommend is Chicken Parmesan, Seared Georgia Mountain Trout, That Double Stack Burger (My Goodness) and the Georgia Peach French Toast.  I must make a confession, I'm black.  Now that the jig is up let's talk about the Bucket O Chicken, it's just ok. I think it's a good appetizer for a group, the sauces they serve and the cool bucket it comes in are a bonus.  The crab & avocado toast includes a lot of crab but the lemon sauce is a distraction. \n\nBest waiter : Dominique \nAmbiance :  Amazing...every room is different.",

The decor is incredible pairing a bit of whimsy with Atlanta. The cassette tape wall is such a neat touch. And the service was just as great. BUT...\n\nThe food is just okay if not underwhelming. Fish tacos were bland and not much better than I have had at chains. The salsa was abysmal and the chips about the same. The brussels sprouts were pretty good, so I'll give them that.  For spending $30-40/person, I expected much better food. With the plethora of incredible options in Atlanta, I would pass on this one until the food matches the effort put into the decor.",

I love the bread they use.  My friend had the burger and we split our entrees. The burger is my second favorite in Atlanta.  It was perfectly cooked and the bun was great.  Next time I will order it with the toppings on the side as to enjoy the flavor of the burger more. The old fashion that I had was absolutely perfect.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  My only suggestion is in the evening to turn the lights down a bit to enjoy the relaxing environment that they have made.  Oh did I mention breakfast, lunch and dinner all day?  I am happy they are in our neighborhood.",
