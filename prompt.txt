review: My second visit to South City and it did not disappoint.  I had the fried chicken which was outstanding. Great flavor and seasoning on the chicken with a crispy outside and moist and tender inside. They also had a homemade hot sauce that they provided: now I am not typically a hot sauce person  but this is a must. My wife had the shrimp and grits and really enjoyed her meal.  The service was impeccable. Our server was very attentive and definitely went above and beyond. I'd come back for the service alone.  Note: They do take reservations and I would recommend. It can get busy at times.

review: Overall  my experience at this restaurant was a mixed bag. Upon arrival  the $20 parking fee across the street was a bit of a turnoff  although the well-lit surroundings provided a sense of security  especially for a group of ladies dining at night. The seating arrangement inside felt cramped  with tables closely packed together  and as the evening progressed  the noise level increased  making it difficult to hold conversations comfortably.  As for the drinks  I opted for a mocktail instead of their gin cocktail  and the gingerade I chose had a pleasant blend of sweetness and spiciness  accentuated by the ginger candy and cherry garnish.  Moving on to the appetizers  the fried green tomatoes were a standout  with the goat cheese stuffing providing a delightful contrast to the crunchy exterior. The pork belly  infused with a caraway vinaigrette and spicy chilies  offered a harmonious balance of sweet and spicy flavors  although the cornmeal spoonbread with smoked pulled pork and white BBQ sauce fell short of expectations.  For my main course  I selected the smoky grilled pork chop  which unfortunately arrived well-done despite my medium request. While the thick cut and grill marks were visually appealing  the brussel sprouts accompanying the dish were inconsistently cooked  resulting in a somewhat mushy texture. A taste of the Carolina trout from a friend's plate left me regretting my choice  as its delicious flavor enhanced by the pear vinaigrette overshadowed the pork chop.  Dessert proved to be another disappointment  with the vanilla bean cheesecake failing to live up to its name. Lacking any discernible hint of vanilla bean and resembling more of an apple compote than a cheesecake  its diminutive size and underwhelming flavor left much to be desired  especially considering its hefty $10 price tag.  While the restaurant's rotating menu promises variety  the inconsistency in execution and the underwhelming dessert experience leave me hesitant to return in search of authentic Southern cuisine. Despite some highlights in the appetizers  the overall dining experience fell short of expectations  and I'll likely continue my quest for exceptional Southern fare elsewhere.

review: 4.5/5  I had a 6 hour layover in Atlanta in early December and wanted to leave the airport to find a local southern cuisine. My friend who lives in Atlanta recommended this place  as it's close to MARTA that goes to/from the airport.  I booked a reservation as this place seems to be popular  and good thing I did because it indeed was popular and I wouldn't have had a seat otherwise. It's a two floor restaurant  but I sat on the first floor.  My friend who recommended me this place said I can't go wrong with any item on the menu  so upon doing some research I went with the She-Crab Soup with a fried chicken added. The soup was delicious  creamy  lots of crab in it  albeit slight bit salty. The fried chicken was amazing! I didn't think a fried chicken breast can be as juicy as a chicken thigh or drumstick  but they somehow did it perfectly here.  Ultimately however  I didn't give this place 5 stars as my server ended up charging incorrectly for what I intended to order. I asked for a she-crab soup with a $10 fried chicken added  but she ended up charging for the separate fried chicken meal for $25...so it ended up costing a bit more than I expected. However given how delicious the food was I let it slide and didn't say anything...but if I return here I'll definitely keep that in mind.

review: I went to dinner with my friend who moved to Atlanta and her childhood friends. They had made a reservation for us.  Parking is pricey at $20 in the lot across the street  and you pay in advance. I'm sure there's street parking somewhere  but this was well lit at night  which is important for 4 ladies.   We were seated at a table toward the back of the restaurant. The tables are very close together and feels cramped. As the night progressed  the restaurant got louder with people chatting.  I was going to try their gin cocktail but decided on a mocktail instead. The gingerade was a little sweet and spicy. I liked the ginger candy and cherry on top.  We started with a few appetizers - fried green tomatoes  cornmeal spoonbread  and pork belly. The fried green tomatoes were stuffed with gat cheese  then breaded and fried. It made the goat cheese melt and ooze out when you cut it. There's a good crunch to it. It normally comes with 3  but they gave us 4 since we had a party of 4. I loved the pork belly. The caraway vinaigrette and spicy chilies made it sweet and spicy. I could've ordered another and just have that with a side or fried green tomatoes. We liked the cornmeal spoonbread the least. It had smoked pulled pork and a white bbq sauce drizzled on top of the cornmeal spoonbread.   For my entree  I was torn between the fried chicken and the smoky grilled pork chop. I got the pork chop. It was a thick cut but had great grill marks. One of our friends ordered the same  and she's pregnant  at she asked for it to be well done. I asked for medium  but it was well cooked. The brussel sprouts were ok. Some of it was overcooked  so it tasted a bit mushy. I tried some of the Carolina trout  and I should've gotten that instead. The fish was delicious with the pear vinaigrette.  For dessert  we shared the vanilla bean cheesecake. We don't know what that was  but it definitely was not vanilla bean or a cheesecake. It was also the size of small coin or something. Donuts are larger than this. There was more apple compote than cheesecake. You can't even see or taste the vanilla bean. I wouldn't even call that a cheesecake. Disappointing and not worth $10. I'd rather get 2 cronuts from Five Daughters Bakery for that price.  I was trying to find good southern food here  but I'll have to keep looking. Their menu changes  and they might keep some proteins/apps  but they may switch out how it's seasoned or cooked.

review: I was passing through Atlanta and wanted an authentic Southern culinary experience. According to numerous foodie websites  South City is one of the best options in Atlanta for just such a thing. And after eating there  it most certainly did not disappoint.  The biscuits are pretty tasty  although they arrive cold which isn't my preference. The fried chicken was among the top 10 I've ever eaten  extra crispy and relatively juicy inside. But the waffles were stunningly good  probably the best I've had outside of Belgium and France! They literally make the perfect waffle! Its texture is tender yet firm  softly dissolving into flavorful goodness as you eat them. The flavor isn't bland - as most pancakes and waffles are - with a subtle essence of vanilla extract creating this absolute perfection! The fresh syrup that accompanies the dish is exquisite. My server was even kind enough to find some powdered sugar for me in the kitchen!  Downtown parking is tricky in any big city  but a lot across the street offers affordable one-hour parking and had plenty of free spots when I visited in the middle of the day. I'd highly recommend South City Midtown for a classic Southern meal!

review: Bomb!! So delicious! I met my friends for lunch and we all got the same thing  I guess it's a staple  so we had too. Our waiter even told us one time had a table of 12 and they ALL got the fried chicken!   Our waiter was great  very quick. We started with the fried green tomatoes  sooo good especially with the goat cheese. The fried chicken is huge  but quantity! I don't mind  had leftovers for dinner  the chicken was crispy but so tender and juicy on the inside. Collard greens and mashed potatoes were cooked perfectly too.   Nice spot! Check them out.

review: I had the trout along with a side of okra. The okra was subpar but the trout  the service  and the ambiance is why they get a 5 star rating.

review: Came in for lunch and it was packed on a Friday afternoon. It was a lot nicer than I expected  low-key felt underdressed. Later we found out that we should have gone to their Peachtree location for a different kind of vibe. This location felt more for business meetings and rich white folks.   Nonetheless  the service was amazing and their fried chicken was heavenly. The cornbread was a miss because it was dry and had corn pieces baked in. Most of the time  what I've learned  is that if cornbread comes in a muffin form - it's more than likely not gonna be good. Their biscuit was a lot better but tasted somewhat undercooked in some places.   Some girls started with the crab soup which was a lot more watery than we expected it to be. My friend said she thought it was gonna come out more creamy texture like a clam chowder. The crabcake and mussels were yummy. The kitchen was nice enough to split the fried chicken meal for us  instead of just giving us an extra plate. I ordered the chopped salad with the fried chicken and the waitress recommended sprinkling their homemade hot sauce which was a great tip!  We just weren't in love with the food for the price. Maybe breakfast is better.

review: I've passed South City Kitchen for years and finally stopped in for dinner. I went on a Wednesday night around 7 p.m. and was shocked at how packed it was on a Wednesday. We made a reservation so we were seated immediately. The host led us through the tight tables to our table on the balcony. Our server was really nice and quickly ran down her recommendations for entrees and drinks. She warned us that two large parties were coming in soon so it would be best if we gave her our order quickly so she could get it in before the large groups. I appreciated her letting us know.  Our server brought us a basket of corn muffins before the entrees. The muffins were okay. They were a little dense and had a corn kernel sprinkled in here and there. I don't particularly need real corn in my corn bread but I say  if you're going to do it and add them...add them. For my entr��e  I ordered the butcher steak. This was a delicious dish. The steak was cooked a perfect medium with a good char on the outside and nicely seasoned. The dish only comes with vegetables so I ordered the mashed potatoes on the side. The potatoes were really good too. They were creamy but still with a little texture and they had flavor. I enjoyed my meal and will definitely go back  maybe on a less busy night.

review: Wonderful downtown experience.  The chicken is the bomb.  If you go  go for the fried chicken.    Cool atmosphere with two floor converted home.  Loved the look and feel.    The meal was fantastic thanks to the star of the show  the fried chicken.  So good.  My meal with the waffle was tasty.  However  I tasted the collard greens  and wow  so good.  That was the better meal  for sure.  If you go  go for that!  Loved it.  Give them a try.

review: 4.75 stars to be accurate  but well round up bc the whole experience was amazing.  I wish I could recall our servers name bc he was absolutely outstanding. He was very helpful  prompt and completely came through with the best recommendations.  We ordered the fried green tomatoes for an appy along with our cocktails. My husband got an old fashioned and I got a pink daisy. Both were chefs kiss.  For our entree  I ordered the pork chop that had a side of the brussel sprouts. 9/10. The Brussels themselves were a 10/10.  My husband got the fried chicken and he voted it a 9/10.  Then the sweet waiter brought us a complimentary dessert banana pudding trifle. How nice!   The ambiance was nice. Lively  but also romantic.   Def recommend

review: We have gotten a few recommendations for this restaurant and decided to finally try it. Make sure you make a reservation. We were lucky enough to sit on one of the anti-rooms not completely inside  but not on the patio. It was perfect as it was not quite as noisy as in the main restaurant. They are very communicative with their restaurant reservations  and there was no doubt as to the time that you were supposed to be there.  We started off with cocktails  and then ordered dinner. Cocktails were great. The biscuits and cornbread were excellent to have with the cocktails. Our appetizers came quickly  which were pork belly  spoon bread with pulled pork  and she crab soup. All three of those were delicious. The spoon bread was a very generous portion.  We felt that our main dishes came too quickly because we were still enjoying our cocktails. We decided next time that we would order appetizers and wait a few minutes to order dinner. I realize it was a Saturday night and they were probably trying to turn their tables over quickly. But we would've liked to of enjoyed our cocktails with appetizers instead of with the appetizers and dinner.  For dinner  we shared fried chicken and the pork chop. Both were done perfectly  with extremely large portions. I don't think I've ever had a better pork chop. The sauce was perfection.   We were celebrating my daughters birthday  and they brought us a banana pudding for dessert with a candle. Very nice touch.   Highly recommend!

review: She-crab soup SLAPS!!!  Gingerade mocktail is sweet and refreshing.  Service is bomb!!  Ok the Carolina Fried Rice is a must have brunch item  and the fried green tomatoes are probably the best I've ever had!  Our server was the best and made sure we had everything we needed and swiftly.  The restaurant is well laid out and decorated  and the diversity and beauty of the patrons was a huge bonus!  I will definitely be back here to try more of this menu!

review: My partner and I were visiting Atlanta for a friend's wedding  and a few of the locals had recommended South City Kitchen for their cocktails  duck  and... fried chicken. So we decided to try it and has been one of the best meals we tried so far!  Food-wise: we got the pimento cheese  pan fried chicken livers (super rich  indulgent  and cooked to perfection)  the fried chicken (which was heavily and served with stewed collard greens and mashed potatoes)  and a side of the roasted corn and bacon hash (has some great pepper flavors in there as well). It was an incredible amount of food (we split the chicken and even had to ask if it was one or two orders because the portion was so large)  with our favorites being the fried chicken and chicken livers. Oh and I can't forget the biscuits and cornbread that they served as well - some of the best cornbread I've had in years!  Drink-wise: my partner got a gin cocktail with cucumber and she loved it! They had a pretty extensive (and reasonably priced) spirits list  so I ended up getting some rye to enjoy with my meal.   Service-wise:  extremely friendly  accommodating  and attentive! Every staff member that we interacted with was a joy - and had great recommendations on food!  Ambiance-wise: once we got upstairs  it felt like we were eating in someone's home. It was cozy  welcoming  and felt intimate. Great spot for a date!  Overall  I'd be back to South City Kitchen again!

review: Good dinner. Great service! Our server Andrew made this an all around enjoyable experience from start to finish. Seated and served immediately  the appetizers were the Nola BBQ shrimp and the Fried green tomatoes. The fried green tomatoes were the star of the meal by far. We're already planning our next trip back just to have them again. The shrimp and grits were complimented  as well as the springer hill chicken plate. The drinks were a little light but still a great dinner.   Pro tips: This place is busy and fills up quickly for dinner and I've heard that the lunch/brunch crowds are even crazier so make your reservations on the website or thru the OpenTable app. Arrive a little ahead of time as midtown's traffic and parking situation are a little sketchy at times. There's very little street parking and all of the parking lots within walking distance were $20 on weeknights.  ENJOY

review: This place was wonderful  from the service to the food. It has a warmth feeling as it once was a historic home. The space was cozy but still spacious. The waiter was courteous and very kind. He gave a history of the restaurant as it was my first time visiting.  I had THE best chicken and waffles ever here. That's right  THE best. When I poured their syrup on it  it just melted in my mouth. The chicken was hot well-seasoned and juicy. I was in food heaven with this menu item. As an appetizer I had the mussels and the broth was also scrumptious. Literally everything tasted great. I don't think I have given a restaurant 5 stars before but this place did it for me! When I'm back in ATL I'll be back!

review: Went for a business lunch as it's close by so can't speak to parking. This is definitely a busy lunch spot so be sure to make reservations!   The dining area can get a bit crowded and it was pretty noisy- hard to even hear who was across from me at noon on a Thursday!  The food is fantastic  as always! The fried green tomatoes are a must and the crab cakes were delicious! They are uniquely done and the sauce served with them is a great addition. The biscuits and cornbread are perfect.  My group ordered the chef's chopped salad with fried chicken (great way to feel semi healthy while still getting the must-have fried chicken!)  the brisket sandwich  shrimp and grits and cheeseburger. All were delicious with hearty portions.  We did have a mix up on a few dishes (burger medium-rare instead of medium-well and wrong sides for 2 of our meals). Other than that  good experience!

review: I found this place off the gluten free reviews online. Just to update folks with allergies  menu items are no longer listed noting dietary restrictions. When I asked the server  she pointed out what could be made gluten free. I ordered the shrimp appetizer without the crostini and she checked with the kitchen and confirmed the Worcestershire sauce was gluten free.  I was impressed with gluten free bread service offered as an appetizer. The entrees took a long time to come out (expected on a Friday evening) and I was disappointed when my shrimp had a crostini on it. I asked the sever for it to be remade  due to my gluten allergy  and the shrimp came back not two minutes later without the bread.   They removed it from the bill and offered to make me something else  but at that point I had lost trust. I assume that they no longer note gluten free on the menu due to issues like this.   The service itself was good and they truly tried to make the situation better. The folks in the group without allergies enjoyed their meals.

review: The cornbread and biscuits were the best complimentary "bread basket" I've ever had at a restaurant  they were heavenly.   We split the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer  by far best fried green tomatoes I've ever had. The restaurant even split the portion for us on separate plates which was a nice touch. They were perfectly fried & the creaminess of the goat cheese paired amazingly with the tomato without overpowering it.  I ordered the King Biscuit  it was rich but it was huge & so difficult for me to eat. I mainly ate the biscuit  ham and gravy. The gravy was definitely my favorite part of this dish!   My boyfriend ordered the egg white frittata and I swear I could eat it every single day of my life. The flavors that the mushrooms  tomato & goat cheese brought to this dish just blew me away. I didn't want to stop eating it & wished that was the dish I ordered! The Charred Corn & Bacon Hash was a great side  it had a meaty flavor and if you are a fan of corn you'll love this dish.   We ordered a lot of food & it was so hard for us not to eat everything because every single dish was so delicious! You definitely have to try South City Kitchen for your next brunch!

review: This place was highly recommended when visiting Atlanta and so I had to make reservations. My first impression  it was a little too loud. I was hesitant  but decided to give it a try nonetheless. We sat on the top floor  the place has a key west vibe which I loved  but it was buzzing and loud with customers.   The food  well the bbq appetizer shrimp was delicious  the sauce was spicy and sweet and the shrimp perfectly blackened. I also order the shrimp and grits with no sauce (stomach issues) and it was delish  I wish I could have the sauce. I did add cheese to the grits  because I pibe cheesy grits. This is not how the plate is  therefore you have to ask for the ass. Now the pork chop  ohhh man that was something else  perfectly cooked with the most flavorsome Smokey taste. The banana pudding came recommended  however I felt the flavor was a little bland  wouldn't order it on my next visit.   Because yes this place is worth a next visit.

review: My last meal in Atlanta couldn't have been better  and I saved the best for last at this fantastic restaurant. Craving biscuits and fried chicken  I was delighted to find a place that not only delivered but exceeded my expectations. They serve fresh cornbread and biscuits before your meal - a delightful touch. I started with the crab cake that was so dedicate  light  and flavorful. The fried chicken salad I ordered was absolutely dredging and incredibly delicious! A must-try for anyone visiting Atlanta!

review: This place has a very nice ambiance to it. The staff was very welcoming and respectful of our time limit. The biscuits we started with were super light and fluffy. I got the fried chicken which was nice and moist  the mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious and the greens had great flavor as well. My husband got the pork chop  it was a little dry but the flavor was great. We tried the banana  pudding trifle for dessert and the texture was super creamy and thick  we loved it. This is a really nice place to try out!

review: Rating this spot as a Californian visiting ATL. South City was recommended by the hotel receptionist  and we are glad we came!  I loved that the restaurant was in a house-like building; it's an intimate and inviting feel. The acoustics however made it a bit loud inside. We asked for seating on the second floor near the window  which was a great spot - for the views and slightly quieter space.  As for the food  we tried an array of dishes: -Fried Green Tomatoes: our first time ever eating this. I'm not a fan of goat cheese  but it wasn't too pungent which was nice. Recommend. -Caesar Salad: pretty fresh. liked the fried okra and fried grits as croutons to give it that southern touch. Recommend if you like caesar. -Fried Chicken: YES to this! The chicken is absolutely juicy  outer part crispy. Collard greens and mashed potatoes were amazing complements. Highly recommend! -Butcher Steak: It was a bit salty for my taste. I liked the carrots and onions on the dish  but wasn't a fan of the main - the steak...go for the fried chicken!! Pass.  Almost forgot to mention how delicious the complimentary cornbread and biscuits were. They were warm and fresh  and we had to take the rest home to enjoy the next day.  Our entire dinner was reasonable priced given all we ordered. I haven't had too much Southern food in my lifetime. This place was the highlight of our food adventures during our short trip to ATL.   Last but not least  the service by our server Marcus was superb. He shared his honest thoughts + recommendations on dishes before we ordered. Without us knowing  he requested to have our dishes split into two so my husband and I could easily share them. The details matter! The food AND service certainly made our experience 5-stars.

review: I have never been to South City Kitchen despite living around Atlanta for 17 years. We went to Brunch on a beautiful Saturday. Thank goodness we made reservations. Memorial Day weekend in ATL is super busy.   The place was packed but we were seated as soon as we entered to the back of the restaurant by the windows. Perfect spot to people watch.   Our server took our drink and appetizer order. We both had Fried Green Tomatoes and a Prickly Pearita drink. Both were so good. The fried green tomatoes were stuffed with goat cheese and red pepper coulis. Divine! The drink hit the spot as well.   Our entrees was the Springer Mountain Farms Fried Chicken  collard greens  mashed red bliss potatoes  honey-thyme jus. All was delicious omg! I also had a side of chicken sausage. The chicken was fried crispy seasoned just right and really juicy. I thought the chicken breast was going to be dry but it was very moist yet cooked perfectly. I couldn't beat all of my meal.   The atmosphere was very busy. I could tell this is a spot for regular locals that live in Midtown. I didn't feel out of place. The staff was super friendly and the food runners were working so very quickly. The kitchen was turning out good very fast as well. Again the place was packed but I can see why. Make reservations people. Atlanta has become that place now where it's hard to just walk in and be seated without a reservation.

review: I was invited for brunch this past Sunday. We arrived when they opened and was promptly seated outside. They have fans and covered patio.  We both ordered the chicken and waffles  I had a order of fried green tomatoes and she had a side of cheese grits.  The food was fresh and very good. Not greasy and the syrup and the waffles were light and not heavy. The waitress stated they make their syrup. The tomatoes were good and the grits were creamy and smooth. The fried chicken was not over seasoned and not dry. We enjoyed our brunch.  We did order a mimosa. Side note: you can not get a mimosa until 11am. Just in case.  Great customer service.  Parking is on the street or in the parking deck close by.

review: Can you believe I'm just now trying this notable restaurant?! Came at 130pm on a Thursday for a working lunch and parked in Mary Mac's designated free parking lot right behind the spot. We arrived and were seated very promptly.   I'm not the biggest fan of soul food or fried and this menu was extensive of that but I was happy to find that there was some grilled/blackened options in the seafood section so I opted to order the blackened catfish. My two sides were Mac & cheese and sweet potato souffl��. I did get a chance to try the broccoli souffl�� and I think I'd swap the sweet potato  out next time for that. We were also given the usual bread and cornbread basket upon arrival.   Food was pretty decent. Didn't blow my mind away or anything like that but it was good. I do think this is one of those places you go to for the history vs the food. I thoroughly enjoyed browsing through their photo wall of the tons of notable people who stopped by at Mary Mac's since it is a historical landmark here in Atlanta.  This place is normally packed to the brim so I'm glad we were able to get in and out without any issues. If you're looking for decent food  an opportunity to support a black business  or just want to say you've had a chance to try Mary Mac's  I'd recommend!

review: I've been hearing about this place for ages but never got to try it until this past Monday when eight of us went.   Our server talked up the great service he was going to provide but it turned out to be not all that great.  Forgotten items   very late deliveries of condiments   confusion of the interuptive food runner  etc.   We ordered lots of appetizers and some were good   some were blah.    I got the Chicken Fried Chicken which was told to be one of the best items on the menu.   It was a huge disappointment.   My guess is that the white gravy sat on the chicken for a long time before being brought to me and made the coating soggy.  My side of collard greens and side of sweet potato souflee were the highlight of my entire experience.    Nobody raved over their meals which tells me that everyone was probably underwhelmed.   We got a laugh at the cinnamon rolls dessert.  Don't do it.   The part that sucked the most was going back to the cars afterwards   in their parking lot   and finding that 3 or 4 cars had their windows smashed.  Not our cars luckily but that sure sucks for those other people.   The next day   half of our group had lunch at Cracker Barrel and they alled seemed to agree that the Cracker Barrel meal was superior to the Mary Mac's Tea Room meal.  That's sad.

review: A midtown Atlanta institution since 1945  everyone should make it down to Mary Mac's Tea Room at least once when hankering for some Southern comfort food in a unique and historical setting. The place is massive with multiple dining rooms  each with their own unique decor and flair. Many have visited over the years  from celebrities to politicians to chefs to musicians to heads of state  and you can find their pictures adorning the walls if you take a little time to explore the place (which I recommend that you do).  Unfortunately  my friends and I only stopped by Mary Mac's for dessert since we couldn't work out a meal with our timing with other activities planned  but we were all glad we visited. The place had a steady flow of customers on a Sunday  with quite a few people that looked like regular repeat customers  which is generally a good sign. Service was kind and friendly  with a little touch of Southern charm. We went with the Georgia peach cobbler  the banana pudding  and the bread pudding. We were going to try the coconut cake which is listed on their website menu  but it wasn't on their restaurant menu  so we assumed it had been taken off the menu at some point and had not been updated. The desserts (3.5/5) were all flavorful and above average  but really nothing stood out with regards to their recipes that we'd go out of the way for to try out again. I really wasn't a fan of their bread pudding texture or flavor compared to others I've tried  so didn't finish it  but a friend was happy to finish mine and commented that it was pretty good. Based on this experience  I wouldn't be inclined to visit Mary Mac's again as I consider it a one and done kind of place for most visitors to Atlanta  but wouldn't object to going again if someone else wanted to grab a meal there.

review: Even though Mary Mac's is temporarily closed now I'm hopeful that they'll be up and running again soon because it truly was a special place. Besides the history  the interior is so unique  the wait staff are amazing  and the food is delicious and PLENTIFUL  let me tell you  you will not leave hungry. I even enjoyed the pot likker in the beginning  it was surprisingly flavorful  and it was all uphill from there. Their homemade lemonade is truly the best lemonade I've probably ever had  they give you a free refill and if you still haven't finished  they give you a to go cup at the end! How sweet! The fried chicken was decent but the blackened catfish was really well made  and all the sides were delicious. I can't wait to go back whenever they're open again!!

review: I've never been to Atlanta before  and I'm a sucker for some soul food and this place came highly recommended so I decided to check it out.  I was expecting to have a long wait because I came on a Saturday at 12pm and they do not accept reservations  but to my surprise...I was seated immediately!   My server was named "bowtie" and he was amazing (ask for him!) Great customer service and gave a lot of recommendations. I love the fact that they serve you complimentary yeast rolls and cornbread.  The ambiance has a cozy and warm feeling which I enjoyed  they were playing old school jams and had photos and memorabilia on the walls  it made me feel like I was eating at someone's home.   There were so many yummy menu options but I decided on the 3 piece fried chicken  Mac and cheese  grits and Augusta Lemonade. I also had the banana pudding for dessert. The food literally came out within 6 minutes  which was surprising.   My fried chicken was good  I added cheese to my grits and they were delicious  and the Mac and cheese was just ok. I only took one bite and knew it wasn't for me  I prefer a rich  creamy and savory mac and I felt this one was a bit dry and lacked taste. The yeast rolls were very good  served warm and I had mine with butter. The cornbread was also good but a tad dry for my liking.  My lemonade was also good. The banana pudding came deconstructed  and it was okay. Was it the best soul food I've ever had? Definitely not  but it was cozy  food was good and the service made up for it.  Overall  I would definitely come back and try some more items on the menu.

review: We had reservations for a party for 13 at 5pm. It wasn't crowded  so I recommend going early. The walls are filled with photos of celebrities who have eaten here - even have some signed posters from Touring Broadway show casts. We were seated after a few minutes and invited to review the menu and write down our orders. That's right  each seat had a small strip of paper that each diner fills out based on what they want to eat and drink - don't forget to put your name at the bottom. They are famous for their fried chicken and it was perfect! The side dishes were delicious too. I did not order my peach cobbler a la mode because I feared I would be too full and I was right. Great place for soul food! Our server was excellent - high energy  attentive; and helpful!

review: Mary Mac's team room is an Atlanta staple. When coming to a city I throughly believe in heading to the spot that have survived the test of time. The mood here is old school atlanta and a home feel. All the dining rooms feel like you are being greeted by Southern hospitality. The ultimate welcome is the warm biscuits and cornbread.   We tried the fried chicken  Mac and cheese  collard greens  sweet potato  rice and gravy  cabbage and broccoli souffle. As far as soul food good this leaves much to be desired. Its a good meal but nothing left me wowed. The mark of a good home cooked meal is how flavorful your side dishes are and for me these fell a little flat.   I suggest giving it a try to form your opinion.

review: I walked in and asked for a table  I was told to wait. A couple walks in and asks for a table  the manager comes and seats them. The hostess had to tell the manager I had been waiting and arrived first. She looked at me and started putting menus away. Then decides she's ready to seat me. That was very unprofessional.   I will say my waiter was amazing  friendly and very professional. My food was ok  fries and Mac and cheese were cold. I'm happy that the fried shrimp were actually hot. Hushpuppies were over cooked  almost burnt. I wouldn't recommend this place. The only neat thing about it was its history.

review: This is the place to go if you want to try some southern food. It's a really big space so I was able to easily get a table.   I absolutely loved their fried green tomatoes and chicken fried chicken. Both of those dishes were probs the best I had in the area. They also have a lot of sides from sweet potato souffle to broccoli souffle. Their peach cobble is also so delicious and the perfect way to end a meal. Don't forget to also get yourself from sweetened iced tea to enjoy!

review: It was alright. The restaurant was definitely hyped up way too much. It smelled pretty bad in the restaurant  possible because it's all carpet. The food was alright.  I have to say the banana pudding was excellent.

review: Mary Mac's was the first meal my partner and I had on our visit to Atlanta  and it ended up setting a pretty high bar. We came in right after our flight around 7:30  and there was no wait; everyone must have left the city for the holidays. The inside of the restaurant is quite big with multiple dining rooms and walls covered in antique photos and newspaper clippings. Service was quite quick with how uncrowded the restaurant was  which was welcome as we were quite hungry after the flight!  We first got complimentary bread and butter  with the buttery rolls really standing out. The cornbread was pretty crumbly and not too sweet; I would have liked it moister but enjoyed how it wasn't too heavy. For my entree  I got blackened catfish  which came with not one but two sizable fillets that were perfectly seasoned. My collard greens were also full of flavor from being cooked with pork  and the fried okra was great as fried okra usually is. My partner got the chicken fried chicken with gravy that he devoured  and he ended up helping me with my fish too. Overall a really great and reasonably priced Southern meal to start our trip  and I'd love to come back on a future trip to Atlanta - still need to try the fried chicken!

review: It's one of the few restaurants with so many options! Hella real Southern food too  cause we had to google some of the food items to know what it was.  You know this place has been here for a while with the old carpeting and all the photos. It definitely can use a facelift  but it the old school-ness does add character and charm. Service is easy  you get a pencil and fill out a paper to give to your waiter/waitress. They take it and then come back with a bread basket with cinnamon rolls  cornbread  and dinner rolls.   We got the small pot likker soup and a side of cornbread with pork skin baked inside. Pot likker was hella good. The pork skin in the cornbread was barely noticeable (bummer). I ordered the fried chicken and gravy and it was instant comfort food. The fried chicken was still crispy with all the gravy on top of it. My friend ordered just appetizers because she wasn't that hungry  but the plates and portions came out like a whole meal!   The place and staff are charming and the food is like a homecooked meal. Come here hungry!

review: A staple in ATL. Beautiful story and there are known for the fried chicken. I love the dressing and gravy. Service was great. They also give every table a free basket of bread. The food was good and is consistently good. I'll be back.

review: What a fun place! Packed. Plenty of people waiting  but no one seemed to wait too long. Three of us were seated in 10 min.  Chris took great care of us. Food was solid home-cooked style. Great selection of Southern specialties.  Noisy  but in a fun way. Everyone enjoying themselves.   The fried okra was flawless. Chicken and dumplings were okay. A couple tiny bones - not an issue. Tender chicken  and the dumplings were the original  thick-noodle style  as opposed to the fluffy Bisquick version I had hoped for. So while I envisioned fluffy dumplings with tender chicken on top  drizzled with some sort of gravy  this was more like a cup of soup. Ample  but smaller portion. See the pic.  Had the wedge salad to start. A little watery  but a great deal for only $7 or so.  The fried green tomatoes were well received.  And three of us got out of there for $77 plus tip. Hard to beat that deal.  Definitely a place to check out when in Atlanta!

review: Mary Mac's is a MUST visit if in the Atlanta area. It is all of the deliciousness that you think of southern food paired with the kindest service and people that have the southern charm.   The building itself has so much history and photos all around the restaurant of wonderful people who have visited. It is also huge with plenty of seating.   The chicken fried chicken is always my go to and does not disappoint. It's tender on the inside with the perfect crisp on the outside and the gravy is so flavorful  it's my favorite I've ever had.   I switch up which sides I get but their dumplings  Mac and cheese  cornbread and dress and their green beans are my favorite.   The meal is huge and there is always enough left for me to eat it two more times which is impressive for the price.   Thank you Mary Mac's for this iconic restaurant that we always look forward to visiting!

review: I was doing some research on Southern food and found Mary Mac's. My friend lives in Midtown within walking distance  so I dined in solo at the bar. There were a lot of holiday parties/groups on a midday work week  and I didn't want to wait for a table. Besides  you meet people sitting at the bar.   The ordering process is a cool concept. You get the menu and a form to write what you want. It's very organized from drinks to desserts. I listed everything I wanted from beginning to end  and the food was served in its natural order...and when I was ready. I needed to pace myself with all the food I ordered. I actually wanted to order/try more sides  but my eyes are bigger than my stomach.  I preferred the cornbread over the yeast rolls and butter. The chicken fried chicken was a thicker cut and breaded nicely. It was tender and juicy  which I wasn't expecting. Nice crunch on the breading. It paired well with the cream sauce and whipped mashed potatoes. The fried green tomatoes  if ordered as a side with your entree  comes with two. The breading held together when I cut it in half to let it cool. The horseradish ranch sauce was surprisingly good when paired with it. The tomato was cooked well - not soggy or underdone or sour. The mac and cheese was my least favorite side. It was more macaroni and less cheese. A bit on the greasy side as if the cheese was broken like when alfredo sauce breaks. I like my mac and cheese on the cheesier side. I had to try the Georgia peach cobbler when in Georgia. It was quite disappointing. I tried to eat as much of the peaches  but it was overly coated in a heavy syrup that had too much nutmeg or some other spice. It made it taste a bit like cardboard. It also lacked crust. I should've gone with the bread pudding instead.  Terry  the bartender  was nice. He joked around with the servers that came by to pick up drink orders. He didn't speak much to the customers like me who were seated at the bar  but he was respectful and checked in periodically.  I ordered all that food for about $30. Not too shabby. The restaurant itself is a historic tea room since it's opening in 1945. A little run down  but it's got old Southern charm and friendly staff. You can tell tourists come here  but there are also locals who come back.

review: Mary Mac's has done a great job preserving its space as a history restaurant in midtown. The entire menu is pretty much every southern comfort food you could think of - fried chicken  fried shrimp  grits  collard greens  peach cobbler etc. I got the fried chicken with 2 sides of mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. The portions were pretty large  and the chicken was cooked well. I recommend the banana pudding for dessert:)

review: Southern Comfort Food...Amen!  This place has been an institution in Atlanta for decades.  I just love coming here for a taste of the south.  The place is huge with lots of various rooms for dining however because it's so popular expect to wait for a table.  No reservations accepted  it's first come first served here.    The menu has a large selection of sandwiches  salads and entrees and half a page dedicated to all the various side dishes available.  You'll get an order slip from your server and grab a pencil from the jar in the center of your table.  Complete your order form and give it back to your server.  Then you'll get a nice  fresh and warm basket of breads including yeast rolls  cornbread muffins and cinnamon rolls.     Today I enjoyed one of their specialties the Chicken Fried Chicken with white pepper gravy.  Delicious!  The food is freshly prepared and so tasty.  I added the tomato pie and sweet potato souffle.  I highly recommend the tomato pie as it's a unique specialty here at Mary Mac's.  And of course your meal wouldn't be complete without the "table wine of the South" a tall glass of sweet tea.    Service is prompt and the food is tasty and although they have an excellent dessert menu you'll likely not make it there as you'll be full from your main meal.

review: Fried chicken yesssss. This place does it well  it's not super crispy or greasy and the chicken is tasty. The service is top notch and the staff is friendly. I love the grits here  you don't need to season it like other places and it comes out ready to eat. Corn bread is corny and my kids love the rice with gravy  although the rice is a little too hard and crunchy so it's not my style. Chicken fried steak can be more tender  I think they should pound the party to soften it a bit. But overall this is a staple for southern style home cooking.

review: I was really happy that Mary Mac's was just a couple blocks away from where I was staying.  I only knew about Mary Mac's from the tv show Designing Women...LOL!  It was mentioned in one of their episodes about the "real women of Atlanta" and the ladies who lunched here.  I was seated in the original building that had a small dining room and kitchen.  And according to my server Carrie  they kept buying the adjacent properties and expanded.  Lots of history on the walls.  I started with a refreshing mint julep.  I ordered the fried catfish and shrimp  with sweet potato souffle and tomato pie...I had never heard of this and it was sooooo good!  Since it was my first time  Carrie brought me a sample of the "pot likker"...the broth from the collard greens and a small corn bread...very good!  The catfish and shrimp were perfectly fried and since I was eating my way through Atlanta today  I didn't finish my yams or pie  but they were very tasty!  Lots of tourists and regulars coming in.  Some of the servers are sassy.  Carrie was great!  For my first meal in Atlanta  it was a great way to start my day!

review: An iconic Atlanta institution! The service was great and the food was tasty. I recommend the collard greens and fried chicken  but the complimentary cinnamon bun and corn bread that come with your meal are wonderful  too!   There is off-street parking behind the building  which is a god-send  and the prices for meals are reasonable. The ordering system is fun: you just write your order on a sheet that's provided at the table.

review: I attended graduate school in Atlanta  but I had never heard of Mary Mac's Tea Room while I was there!  Well  as the saying goes  "if you don't know  now you know."    This is an AWESOME place to eat  with healthy size portions!  I highly recommend the Meatloaf!

review: Our last night in Atlanta  and we decided to follow-up on several recommendations and headed to Mary Mac's Tea Room.    We had a delightful dinner as we stepped back it time.  The building  the decor  and numerous photos on the wall represent an earlier era.  The menu and the ordering process  placing your order using pencil and paper date back to the orgin of Mary Mac's.  We started with green fried tomatoes.  They were prepared perfectly and served with a creamy horseradish sauce.  We both chose the four piece fried chicken dinner.  I paired mine with whipped potatoes  cream gravey  and fried okra.  Jan paired her's with lima bean and fried okra.  The meal was excellent.  We ordered bread pudding and peach cobbler for desert but took it to go.  Mary Mac's outstandingly represents southern tradition and comfort food.

review: I had been wanting to try this place and finally had the chance. There was a short wait to be seated.  We were given menus and paper to fill out what we would like. I love this idea because it makes it very clear so if something is wrong  it is your own fault! The portions were large and the food was very flavorful. The waitress was very friendly. I would definitely come back and try some of the other things on the menu.
