Parking wise, there's a small lot behind or you can find free street parking nearby. \n\nIt's seat yourself inside and our server was super attentive and friendly, checking in on us consistently. I just had a Tropicalia, but they had lots of interesting beers on tap which I appreciated. I loved how varied the menu was too! I got the Bantam Chicken Sandwich, and my friend got the Lamb Burger. The chicken sandwich was PHENOMENAL. I LOVED the jalapeno aioli that was on it and the chicken was super tender and juicy. The sweet potato fries I subbed in were also perfectly crunchy. I also tried a bite of the lamb burger and that was also delicious. \n\nOverall, very casual and easy spot for lunch and can't wait to go back!!",

                "text": "First time here and the service was a bit underwhelming due to them being short staffed. There's free street parking and we sat outside. At first the bar tender said she was the only one and I had to go in to place my order as she was bringing other peoples food out and checking in them. I waited for my friend and went in and out and she was busy. Luckily, a Spanish only speaking buswoman was very kind and checked  in on me periodically while I waited and again when my friend arrived and started us with water. I asked the last to take our order when she came back out to bring the other table some stuff and she did. \n\nBased on her recommendation I had the arugula salad, add salmon and it was good. My friend enjoyed her fried chicken but didn't eat the corn and only a few bites of the potatoes. Food came out hot and fresh. The fries were delicious too! Def a good spot to get some fries ($5). I asked for extra ketchup and got ketchup packets which was odd to me since it didn't come that way. I can't remember how much we spent in total but the food was good. It's a bit out of my way so can't say I'd return any time soon. \nOh, the outdoor seating area has fl idling fans which is nice. The inside was a little too packed due to legs parties.",

I got the bantam burger medium well, it was delicious!! Perfectly salted , a bit heavy if you don't eat a lot of salt but for me it was peeerfect. Super savory and a little spicy but enjoyable spicy not omg I'm dying spicy! I also asked for jalape\u00f1o aoili it was divine. You can tell who ever is cooking cares and is making the food properly. \nMy tiny little complain was there was no gluten free bun. At the end of the day it was fine because I don't mind eating a lettuce wrap, but it would be nice to have the option.",

I think it's definitely for the neighborhood though. When you first walk in there's no hostess area..it took a minute to realize it's seat yourself.  There's no sign and no one to tell you that. Now if you're a regular and already know that it's cool but it's kinda awkward and even unwelcoming if not.  \n\nOnce seated though it's all uphill.  Our server was sweet and attentive.  We ordered the frittata, the bantam burger and the breakfast plate.  I enjoyed the frittata. The veggies inside is what gave it most of its flavor.  I wish I would have asked for the potatoes to be cooked more...I like my home fries  crispy. My hubby thought the grits were good in his breakfast plate.  My son hit the jackpot with that burger.  I was looking at the brunch menu and didn't realize there was a regular burger option.  We just got all the veggies on the side and I put them on my frittata. It was a good burger.  I generally don't like battered fries but theirs were good.  \n\nCustomer service is really what bumped my star up..we had a misunderstanding with the bill (truth be told I misunderstood how they handle the buy one get one with the Passbook) but I really appreciated how it was rectified. I would go back to try those empanadas everyone on yelp is raving about!!",

They have lights outside during the evening and have a really fun dive bar decor them on the inside. The restaurant is small, but when I went around 1pm, seating was easy to find. \n\nOur waitress Olivia was incredibly pleasant and very knowledgeable about both the food and drink menu. She also had a welcoming energy; her service added to the experience in a positive way.\n\nI had the lamb burger which came with a tropical marmalade and cheese, and it was delicious! The lamb is ground and shaped into a normal patty, so I recommend this to anyone looking to stray away from a classic burger but looking for a similar vibe. I ordered a side of sweet potato fries, while my friends got regular fries, and both were crispy and delicious. Lastly for dessert, I got the red velvet cake which was surprisingly moist and soft. \n\nI recommend this pub to anyone looking for quick yet super delicious food and drink",

I walked in, never greeted. \n2. 5 minutes later my publicist walks in and we decided to sit at the bar\n3. never greeted, never provided or offered a menu, drink, etc.\n4. My publicist asks the patron sitting to her left if we could look at her menu\n5. The bartender (never received a name or hello) speaks and asks everyone but to only 2 black females at the bar if they needed anything, are you good, can i get you anything else, are you ready to order, etc.\n6. Publicist has to say \"excuse me can we get menus please\"\n\nNeedless to say there is a lot more that took place but will not be disclosed publicly yet as I have called back immediately following to file a formal complaint and have been waiting 2 days now to hear from the General Manager or above. The negative, hostile treatment from the staff made the ambiance terrible for me. Just as dark as the decor and lights in the establishment and bathroom, so is my overall outlook of this establishment. I do not feel it is a place for my kind to patronize.",

The Empanadas were HUGE and the Shrimp dish was served over cream corn. Interesting yet yummy combination.\n\nI really wanted a burger and I looovveee mushrooms so the Bantam Burger was a great choice. I removed the Poblanos ( I don't do spicy) and added bacon. So good!

Fairly small inside, but they have some outside seating when the weather permits.\n\nHave a handful of drafts, most local, but nothing very interesting. My wife and I split the Bantam Burger and the Bantam Chicken sandwich. I can only give the Bantam burger only 2 1/2 stars - the patty itself was not very big or juicy; too much bun and not enough flavor. The chicken sandwich was much more flavorful and had some nice toppings; I would rated at 3 1/2 stars. Went with the side of french fries and they were quite good. \n\nWe visited on a cold evening and the inside of the restaurant also seemed quite chilly. This seems to be a nice, neighborhood spot to grab a quick meal and a drink.",

My Loft is across from Ponce City Market, but I find 90% of the drink and dining options there contrived and overpriced.  I much prefer Krog Street Market, or something like this small neighborhood pub.   \n\nIt reminds me of Neighborhood place in The East Village and West Village that I used to go to.    The have good, non-pretentious food at affordable prices that is a step above basic bar food, but also doesn't try to over step its bounds in terms of complexity or price.    I've had Mussels, Steak Tacos, Fish and Chips and a few other things here.  I have not yet tried their Lamb Burger.   So it is still on my list as it is known for it.\n\nI love that they have an Affordable reasonably high quality Malbec on the Menu.   The Dona Paula is a good quality wine that packs a punch and I have ordered  this by the bottle many times here.   They have a decent whisky cocktail, and carry Brooklyn Lager on Draft.    People are always friendly here, and it is non-pretentious.    My kind of place to catch a game or spend a few hours on a leisurful weeknight.",

                "text": "We came to Bantam Pub because of a 25% back deal on Seated and walked away liking this place. This is a great little neighborhood pub. They call themselves the \"Cheers of Ralph McGill\" and I could see why -- when we entered the restaurant around 6:45pm on a Tuesday, the bar was full with what looked like regulars, relaxing, unwinding, and having a good time with the bartenders and each other. This intimate, easy-going atmosphere instantly hit me when we entered. It was cozy, warm, and welcoming and I think this type of environment is what draws people to this place. It was really chill and laid back.\n\nThere's plenty of free parking. They have their own lot in the back and you can park on the street.\n\nThe pub has a low-profile look and it's small. There are two rooms, one with the bar and a banquette with some dining space and another room with tables and big TVs that are great for sports viewing. I guesstimate the first room can seat about a dozen people at the bar and another 18 at tables. The second room can probably seat about 35-40 comfortably. Additionally, they have patio and sidewalk seating and it looks like there's a separate outdoor bar off to the side. The ambiance is more old-school and traditional. Lots of wood. The tables were candle-lit and ours had a real flower centerpiece. I liked the colorful Christmas lights they use for decor. During our visit, I enjoyed the music which was an eclectic remix featuring many 80s hits.\n\nThey had a decent drink menu with 10 beers on draft (half local), bottles, wine, cocktails, and whiskies. The food menu is elevated pub grub. Apps like crispy shrimp ($14) and hummus plates ($11), burgers and sandwiches ($11-15 each), salads ($7-9 each), entrees like fried chicken ($14) and hanger steak ($21), smoked wings (6 for $7 or 10 for $12), chili ($8), taco plates ($12 each), homemade soup, and sides like red pepper grits ($4) and loaded fries ($7). The homemade soups during our visit were bacon clam chowder and \"Stewnami\" (a seafood soup) for $8/cup and $12/bowl. There were also blackboard specials -- duck breast for $22 and chocolate cheesecake for $8.\n\nBrunch is served every Saturday and Sunday, 10am-2:30pm.\n\nWe got an app and two entrees:\n\n* Pub mussels ($12) - fresh garlic, basil in a beer broth\n* Bantam burger ($14) - roasted mushrooms, sauteed onions, poblanos, Brie\n* Duck breast special ($22) - Brussels sprouts, sweet potato, pickled onion\n\nThe food was good.\n\nThe mussels were delicious. Good quality. The broth was delectable. I didn't taste any beer in it. Instead, it tasted almost like a spicy Thai coconut soup broth to me. It had a creaminess and milkiness to it. I loved it. It was relatively light too, which I appreciated. Oftentimes, mussel broth can be too rich and intense. There were 15 mussels in the bowl and they came with a side of bread (four slices). We asked for more bread ($2) to eat with the soup after we had finished the mussels.\n\nThe Bantam burger was A-OK. We asked for it to be cooked medium. Not the kind of burger that will blow you away, but still tasty and satisfying. It came in a nice, manageable size and wasn't one of those gargantuan burgers that a lot of chains are serving these days. It was refreshing in that sense. The roasted mushrooms and Brie cheese were my favorite ingredients. The burger came with a side of fries and ketchup. The fries reminded me of Checkers fries in terms of taste and texture. They had that extra airy and crispy batter on the outside. Lightly seasoned too. Yum.\n\nI saw the special duck breast entree on Bantam Pub's Facebook page and then on the blackboard, so I had to get it (it looked good). A small piece of duck breast was cooked to what looked like medium rare, sliced into six pieces, and served on a plate with a generous helping of chopped Brussels sprouts and sweet potato, and topped with pickled onion. The duck was cooked perfectly. The skin was crispy and the meat was moist and tender. Overall, the duck was flavorful and gratifying. Lean, high quality, and full of umami. The Brussels, sweet potato, and pickled onion sides were ideal accompaniments.\n\nMullany was our server and she was terrific. The main bartender lady was friendly too.\n\nTL;DR - Bantam Pub is a great little pub with good food and service and a comfortable, cozy atmosphere. I enjoyed our experience here.",

On warmer days, there are relaxed seats outside.  Chill neighborhood vibe.\n\n++.   Food is scratch made gastro pub fare.  My friend and I split a lamb burger and a bantam chicken sandwich. They were both better than each of us expected!  For sides we both substituted vegetables in lieu of fries.  My friend's green beans were perfectly al dente and my Caesar salad was one of better ones in Atlanta.  \n \n+.   Price is reasonable low teens for most sandwiches.  There is a small up charge for side substitutions.  Ours were $3 each.  \n\n++.  Service is prompt, friendly and attentive! \n\n+.

It's really fitting for just a variety of occasions and they are open late. This has become my \"MacLaren's\" even though I live 10 minutes away. And free parking on the beltline? A thousand times yes. They have a huge patio which has come in handy during covid. Even if you're outside, you still get table service and they are really good about checking on you. Everyone is so nice. The food is not your average pub food, it's better. Definitely get the calamari! The burgers are also amazing. The loaded fries are listed as a side but the portions is huge and great for sharing. I have not ever had a bad thing here. And they also have brunch! Basically, if you're looking for a chill fun pub with good food then Bantam is IT!",

My boyfriend really likes the beer here so that's all I can base my drink review on since I don't enjoy drinking beer as much. I got the chicken wings here and I thought they were pretty good and a nice appetizer to compliment the evening. I really enjoy the outside seating here as there are multiple heaters to warm up the soul and string lights to brighten up the mood. Otherwise, I've seen the indoor seating get quite crowded and sometimes it's difficult to even get the bartender's attention because it's so popular.",

We also learned that they have brunch.\n\nA gentleman stopped by to ask about our experience, and he was friendly. He informed us that aside from the brunch menu, anything on the regular menu was available for ordering. He also seemed surprised at and hoped that the burger was good when he brought it out to us. I guess he hadn't tried it. :/\n\nThe angel burger was the special for the week; it was good but messy to eat though. It had mustard BBQ sauce and crispy bacon pieces. The sauce simply spilled all over and made the burger sort of soggy. :( The actual short rib, brisket, and chuck burger with crispy onions were fine if the sauce was lessened.\n\nThe side of breakfast potato sides from the brunch menu was okay, but it was quite small and a tad expensive for the portion. Aside from the brunch side selections, their regular menu didn't seem to offer any sides. :/ Why?! You're a pub...\n\nThough the restaurant may be small, there was plenty of outdoor spaces on either side of the restaurant offering various shading from the sun. \n\nThere's a large bike rack for cyclists and street parking directly in front for drivers.",

There was a nice large rack in the front for bicycle parking. \n\nThe owner? stopped by and talked to us for a min about our experience and the food. He was pretty nice. This place is pretty small. \n\nThe angel burger was special for the week; it was delicious and worth the price of $5 for burger week. I wasn't sure if it was on their main menu. I like BBQ sauce but my wife is not a huge fan. It was messy but I enjoyed it.\n\nI got a side of breakfast potatoes for $4 with our burgers. The portion was kind of small for the price. Most of the time the price is reflected in the location and not necessarily the quality of the food. I didn't try anything else on the menu except for the limited time burger but it left a good impression.\n\nWould I come here again?\nProbably not. The location is far from my place and parking is difficult in this area. I'd really have to be in the area for me to visit again.",

It airs next to some large apartment communities and right off the Beltline. \n\nI ordered, and enjoyed the Bantam chicken sandwich minus the bread:  grilled chicken with bacon, mushrooms, onions Parmesan cheese, jalape\u00f1o aioli.  It's typically served on challah bread.   It was cheesy and would make for a messy sandwich.  Be prepared with some extra napkins! The sweet potato fries side was just okay. \n\nMy daughter ordered the Bantam Burger with Poblano peppers, caramelized onions, portobello mushroom, Brie cheese on brioche. The burger was cooked perfectly juicy medium, but unfortunately was bland.  The burger needed some salt/pepper, and while my daughter loves Brie, it added nothing to this burger.  I took a bite, and I agree.  \n\nLook forward to trying other menu items on my next visit!",

Now that I have the facts out of the way, I'll begin with the review of my experience. \n\nWe visited this small establishment on a rainy day during Burger Week. We noticed they had a small herb garden growing in the back right of the parking lot, super cool. The entrance was a little confusing because we didn't know if we should just have a seat or wait to be seated. We sad at the porch side with the plastic flaps over the windows. The patron's second hand smoke kept blowing through the gaps in the plastic, which was gross to me. The burger was good & came with fries & ketchup. It had some walnuts on it, which I was saving until last, but the server took away my plate before I was finished eating. We had been hanging out a while, because it was a rainy day, just talking & drinking. But, but, there were still fries & walnuts I wanted to eat!\n\nAnyway, this place is within walking distance of the belt line so I'd probably come here for a casual drink with an interesting crowd, but I wouldn't drive here because the parking situation isn't great. The lot is very small & you'll have to find street parking if it's full.",

They have an outdoor patio and the weather was perfect. \n\nI had the fried chicken brunch entree which was recommended by my waiter. One word, phenomenal. The service was pretty good overall. \n\nI would definitely come by and check it out. I didn't appreciate the dogs on the patio (as the patio is small) and the owners didn't seem to have to keep their dogs in order and one kept coming up under my table/chair.",

Tapas style brunch i guess? Things only got worse from there when we were directed to self serve our own water.  \n\nIf your short staffed just be upfront so people can choose if they have the time and patience for that and avoid frustration getting taken out on the servers.
