We waited an hour but it went by fast with the decent craft beers on draft and $0.50 pinball games. The pinball games were so much fun and not crowded on a Saturday noon time. The service was very friendly and let us hang out and remembered that we wanted the wings so gave us the lunch menu a few minutes early. \n\nWorth the wait for the lemon pepper wings . So crispy and juicy.",

Sandwich was good. The sour cream/horseradish sauce that came with it was more or less sour cream with just a faint hint of horseradish (would have preferred more horseradish). I'm just gonna hang out here man. I'll just hang here that's fine.\n\nI don't recall ever having horrible ketchup, that is until I came here. The ketchup they offer is very vinegary and just plain nasty. Fortunately, they had one other brand that was organic, and it was fine tasting.\n\nService was good. They have a full bar with several draft offerings.",

This was my first time at the restaurant and I honestly will be back. \n\nThe venue has a neighborhood feel. The hardwood floors are great with the natural design aesthetic. The big windows provide ample natural light and allow you to experience the area as a whole while sitting inside. \n\nWe booked the back room which is a huge area. There is also a speaker connection which is great as it allows you to create your own ambiance that you desire. There is also a curtain you can close which allows for you to be off in your own world while still being present at the venue. \n\nAlong with the booking, you get your own servers for the room. This is a great addition as it makes the service and experience as a whole very personal. The service provided was amazing. The servers were friendly. They knew the food and drink menu very well and were able to keep everyone's orders in order and keep away from any confusion or mix ups. \n\nThe food at Manuel's was AMAZING! I decided on the Steak Quesadilla with a side of Tater Tots. I'll be honest, I think I'm addicted. LoL!!! \n\nThe steak in the quesadilla was tender, meaty, seasoned, and most of all a perfect portion. The quesadilla as a whole is a healthy portion and great as a personal meal or one to share. (I want another one now. LoL!)... the Tater Tots took me back to childhood. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They were a perfect pairing for the Quesadilla. Furthermore, the fixings that come with the quesadilla were fresh and good. Can you tell I enjoyed my meal?\n\nOverall this was a great experience. Manuel's is perfect for a group of friends or a personal meal. You can't go wrong with dropping in.",

I did not enjoy the sauce at all, it was kind of like a sweet and spicy peppery sauce, but the size and taste of chicken was amazing. I would order again with a different sauce. The tots with ranch were delicious. My companion ordered the chicken fried steak and really enjoyed it! I'd recommend this place",

It's truly the perfect spot for an event like this, with a big room full of large tables and a laid-back dive bar vibe. The walls are covered in memorabilia, and you can immediately tell why it's a neighborhood institution of sorts. \n\nThere was only one server handling the entire room, so service was a bit slow, but that's to be expected. He did the best he could! The draft list was pretty amazing, and you can order most drinks as either a pint or a pitcher. For the food, I had a Philly cheesesteak, which was great bar food, with a generous serving of crinkle fries. I hope to be back.",

They have free parking lots behind their place and across the street. \nWe came here to watch a World Cup match on a Sunday because they open at 9:30 am and the match began at 10 am. It is hard to find a brunch place that opens before 11 am because in Georgia places can't serve alcohol before 11 am on Sunday. We sat at the bar. Our server was very friendly. She knew lots of people that sat at the bar, so it seems like a place lots of regulars visit. \nOnce it turned 11 am I had their spicey bloody mary and then I had the mimosa. For the mimosa they pour a bit of orange juice in a glass and then give you a little bottle of prosecco to pour yourself. \nFor food I had the fried chicken biscuit and cheesy grits. The grits were so good. The fried chicken was a little tough, seemed too cooked, for my taste. I did like the biscuit so next time I come here I will try something else that comes with the grits and biscuit.",

They were to die for. \nMy lunch companions ordered the Hot Dog Plate with chilli added. The hot dog plate comes with two delicious hot dogs, they ordered the collard greens. \nMy other lunch compaion ordered the Country Fried Stake, it was huge and topped with white pepper gravy, along with collard greens, mashed potatoes and a third side came with that dish as well which was red beans and rice. I'm not sure if that was a special yesterday or it comes with three. \nEveryone enjoyed their meal.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the delicious Blueberry pie with ice cream, I was excited to see two heaping scoops. \n\nI'm happy I finally got a chance to visit the best voted neighborhood bar in Atlanta!\nI can't wait to come here again.",

I do appreciate the vibe of an old school tavern with no frills on the pub grub. I came here with a group of friends and found ample seating. No hosts, so it's a bit confusing where to sit. But if you opposite the old school pinball machines, there's a large dining room. I wanted to try the hot dogs but opted for the chicken tendies instead. The coating on the tenders was a bit thick but the chicken was moist and flavorful with the horseradish sauce. I started dipping my crinkles in the side sauce. So tasty! They had a wide variety of beers, very impressive selection. I had an Alpha Abstraction vol. 21, which can be hard to find in the city on tap, so kudos on selection! Great spot to hang with friends post game for drinks and pub grub.",

                "text": "R and I met up with two friends a couple of weeks ago on Wednesday for lunch.  This place was recommended because Manuel's Tavern has a lot of history, opening in 1956.  The owner was a strong supporter of the Democratic Party, and his business became a venue and a meeting place for decision makers and supporters of the party.\n\nFree parking is available and can easily be found in two parking lots; one behind the tavern and the other one diagonally across the street.  There are, what I consider, three separate sections in Manuel's Tavern: the bar area with a big bar and booths with tables, a nice sized meeting room (First Level - that's what it's called) and a large dining area (named Eagle's Nest).  Wood is used almost everywhere - tables, counters, walls, ceilings.  Whatever isn't mostly wood is brick.  There are so many things on the walls, many pictures of customers/patrons, plaques, and many random things.  You have to come here to see it.  I actually love the old and quirky vibe.  If this place could talk...!\n\nWhen the four of us arrived, we sat at one of the tables in the large dining area.  There were probably 5 tables total that had customers sitting at them, with two servers handling everyone.  We had a QR code at our table that brought up an online menu, but it didn't have any prices listed.  No, this is not one of those places that intentionally leave off prices on its menu.  A server came to our table and brought us menus after we pointed out that the online menus didn't provide prices.  It's a good thing that we weren't in any hurry, and were taking our time catching up with each other since we hadn't seen our two friends for a few months, because our server took her time getting to us.  Eventually, our server came to take our orders, writing them down on her order pad.  I ordered the country fried steak, fries, green bean casserole and a biscuit.  R ordered the corned beef reuben and fries.  Z ordered the lunch special tacos meal, and S ordered the pulled pork sandwich meal.\n\n45 minutes later, our food was served.  We were all really hungry by the time our meals arrived.  Unfortunately, I didn't like my meal at all.  The country fried steak, including the gravy, was barely warm.  Instead of getting the fries and green bean casserole that I ordered, cubed roasted red potatoes were on my plate, and collared greens were in a side bowl.  As I ate my very bland and mediocre country fried steak (had to add salt and pepper to have any flavor), I waited for our server to come back out on the restaurant floor, but that took about 10 minutes.  By that time, I had finished my country fried steak, and sampled a bite each of the red potatoes (cool temperature and just ok tasting), the collared greens (salty and cool temperature) and the very flavorless and cool (temp) biscuit.  Finally I got to flag the server down, explained that I didn't get what I ordered, and told her what I ordered.  She offered to get me what I had originally ordered and asked if I wanted to keep the two side dishes, to which I quickly answered that I didn't want to keep them.  Ten minutes later, she brought my hot sides.  The fries were very good.  Crisp but not hard on the outside and salted just perfectly.  The green bean casserole was just awful, though - completely mushy, and I didn't have any way to salvage the flavor.  The salty collared greens tasted a lot better than the green bean casserole, but that isn't really saying much.  The others said that their food was ok - no one raved about any of their meals, though.   R told me that the chef got chintzy with the amount of meat in his sandwich.  I was disappointed with our server because she seemed to purposely ignore our table, plus, with her writing everything down on her order pad, how did my two sides come out incorrectly and almost cold?  In hindsight, I believe that my meal was ready first, but it stayed in the kitchen and got cooled down while the other meals were completed so that all of the meals were served at the same time.\n\nI definitely won't be coming back here for mediocre food and inattentive service.",

It is still some of the best bar food you will find in Atlanta. From the perfectly crisp tots. To the flavorful wings and the incredible bar staff. When you walk in you feel like you've become a part of this great cities history. I could go on and on about the drinks. How well diverse the Beer and drinks menus are.

The insane Dogzilla with everything is a must have for anyone making their first visit.  Other great options include the Ruben, Chicken Salad Melt, House Chili, and French Dip.  I love all the pics you'll see hanging of older Politicians who visited Manuel's in it's younger days.  A bit of history hanging throughout the Dining Room and Bar worth walking around to see and read the descriptions offered with some of them.\n     Then my favourite part are the Pinball Machines.  Who doesn't love those???  I gleefully feed them my money, getting my happy levels up.  I have to always warn my friends in advance if I stray from the Table, that's where I'll be.  \n     The vibe of the place to me is a \"Working Person's\" place.  It's welcoming, warm Staff, friendly Customers who genuinely may offer to buy you a Beverage just because they can.  If I lived closer, this would most likely be my regular spot.  FYI, the place has been owned by the same Family since it's inception, so that is just another reason why this place is so special for so many Patrons.",

There really is something for everyone on their menu. We opted for mozzarella sticks, a bowl of homemade chili, country fried steak, and a McCloskey burger and it did not disappoint.\n\nService was fantastic here and although there was karaoke happening in the other area/room we were always tended to. I could hear the folks doing karaoke were having a blast as we could hear their music from our booth (near the front door). \n\nLots of sports playing overhead on the tv's and the main room audio which wasn't a distraction but a great way to indulge in some sports action as we waited for our food.\n\nI also loved looking at all the photos around the wall and lined along every nook and cranny in this place. It really shows the charm and local feel of Atlanta. Can't wait to come back and get some more grub and drinks.",

My first Brunswick Stew did not disappoint - a hearty bowl of warmth with pork and chicken with just the right balance of savory.  I was a bit disappointed with the nachos.  They were super liquidy - leaving the chips very soggy.  I see other patrons enjoy them, so maybe this plate was a bit off.  \nLots of terrific knick-knacks that have adorned the premises for about a dozen presidential administrations.  Absolutely worth dropping-in.",

If it's been here fifty years, I would not be surprised.\n\nTwo rooms, one with the bar and the other is for dining. The bar is classic with a mirrored wall behind shelves of booze. Beer taps and fridges stocked with all sorts of stuff. A few barflies hanging out as well.\n\nThey do have a full menu and at least for the moment (July 2020), they're serving dine-in.\n\nWe got a round of drinks or two and just enjoyed the atmosphere.\n\n[Review 13627 overall, 946 of 2020, number 320 in Georgia.]",

This place is legendary, as most say. Very cool vibe in here, laid back bar, and an amazing list of draft beer. We were going to an early show so it wasn't crowded (around 5:30pm on a Thursday), and we got our food very quickly. \n\nWe ordered the Greek salad to split, and it was good - nothing too special, but it didn't need to be. For main dishes, we ordered the corned beef reuben, which was perfect. One of the better ones I've had in Atlanta, for sure, and I'd get it again in a heartbeat. K ordered the country fried steak, and it was HUGE. They do not skimp on the portions here, at all - we took home a box full of leftovers. The steak was great, collard greens were decent, and the mashed potatoes and biscuit were both divine. \n\nLoved it - we will absolutely not be strangers to Manuel's again.",

My wife and I just ordered from your restaurant and she and I both agreed that we needed to let you know how delicious it was. It was our first time and we didn't know what to get so we ordered the chicken quesadilla, chicken nachos, wings and a salad. EVERYTHING was seasoned beyond perfection and great portion sizes. The only feedback/recommendation we have is for the possibility of the chips to be separated from the toppings for the nachos. They were quite soggy by the time it was delivered. But we had some extra tortilla chips here at home so we were still able to enjoy the meal. \nAnd thank you for this note in our bag. This is an amazing idea! Again, phenomenal meal! Keep it up!\"\n\n\n\nI have no photos to add because we scarfed the food DOWN!  it really was tasty as hell.",

I had the behind burger which was really good, my daughter just had a side of mac n' cheese and enjoyed that too. Plenty of parking is definitely a bonus, too!

                "text": "Hoping for a bite to eat. Manuel's Tavern was suggested and so we headed on over for dinner, surprisingly finding a parking spot in their rear lot.\n\nWhen we walked in, the place was packed!  We saw three main rooms.  The one front and center when you walk in, a main dining area to the left, which holds what seemed like 100 people, and a smaller room to the right, which was blocked off for a private function.\n\nWe seated ourselves in the larger dining area to the left, and just a fair warning, this place is PACKED on a Friday evening.  Wait staff eventually got to us and we ordered the following:\n\nMemphis BBQ sandwich - $7.95\nSide of Onion rings - $2.25 to add on\nFish basket - about $9\n\nStarting with the Memphis BBQ sandwich, it is a slow cooked sliced pork protein that's cooked in their house bbq sauce.  That's all topped with slaw and its placed in a kaiser roll.  You can also get fries or sub out the fries for something else.  I chose to sub for a side of Onion rings.\n\nThe sandwich was hit or miss.  My first bite was dry and flavorless, my second bite was sweet and tangy.  The third bite was Cole slaw intense.  There really wasn't any uniformity here and each time I took a bite it was a different flavor.  That's fine when each bite tastes great...but some of the bites missed the mark for me.\n\nThe onion rings were thick cut and crispy.  The batter wasn't really seasoned, although ketchup took care of that for me.  Probably wouldn't order the rings again but if they were sitting in front of me, sure i'd throw down a few.\n\nI didn't try the fish basket due to my allergy, but they came with two sides.  She asked for hush puppies and collard greens.  The greens were okay, and while the hush puppies had good flavor, they were little grease balls.  I was told the fish was okay.\n\nLocated off of North Highland ave, parking for Manuel's shouldn't be a problem.  Although it was packed, we did find a parking spot behind the building (you can enter from the rear or the front of the restaurant), but there's also additional parking at the lot next door.\n\nSeating is plentiful.  We counted several heads sitting at several tables, and while navigating to find our own, there was a table or two still available during this busy period.\n\nThis is my second time to Manuel's tavern and we'll probably come back at some point.  It has enough menu variety, it's close enough where it's convenient and while the food is hit or miss for me, when it's a hit, it's definitely a hit.",

Burgers aren't $4.99 anymore and now they got the Beyond Burger and that's not all, they even have a veggie patty that quite frankly sounds much more delicious than the Beyond burger. Well I normally don't eat red meat anymore but I made an exception for old times sake. I must say the Manuel Burger with Blue-cheese was a fastball down the middle! Truly delicious with a crispy exterior, juicy inside. The onion, tomato and lettuce on the burger were very good quality too.",

                "text": "My favorite neighborhood restaurant in Georgia. I have lived within walking distance of Manny's on and off for twenty years. Many of my friends live nearby and it became a routine happy hour, afterwork, pre-game meet-up destination. It is the kind of place you can take your parents when they visit from out of town, without having to make a reservation. For decades it was a hangout for Atlanta journalists, CNN employees and local Democrats. Presidents Clinton, Carter and Obama have all eaten here. Be sure to pay homage to the painting of JFK behind the bar. The names of regular patrons, living and deceased, are engraved on some of the barstools.\nAs for the menu, it is classic American bar cuisine, cooked just how you like it when you make it yourself at home. Large portions. Rich savory sauces. Fresh breads. Large chicken wings. And the menu has just about everything. My favorites are the Wings with Terry Sauce, the Chicken Philly, the Lasagna, the Rueben, and the McCloskey Burger with Blue cheese and mushrooms (always with the House Steak Fries, and add the house side salad if you're really hungry).\nTips: There is a second parking lot across the street. There is reserved parking for clergy. There are two electric charging parking spots. They do take out. They have side rooms for hosting Corporate meetings, D&D clubs or your fantasy football draft. There used to be a chicken coop on the roof where they collected fresh eggs. Not sure if it is still there since the remodel. The staff is local, professional, courteous and they treat their regulars with respect. They honor long-time employees by naming menu items after them and placing their pictures on their hallowed walls. They used to have a couple of pinball machines, not sure if they are still there. The staff write down your orders with pen and paper. There are no apps or digital menus or tech. They announce daily specials on their Facebook page.",

I've been missing out. \n\nMy guests both ordered the french toast - one with bacon and one with sausage. They loved it! The portion size was perfect and they both cleaned their plates. I ordered the special, the asiago asparagus omelet which was delicious! The plate came with a cup of fruit, a biscuit, and grits or potatoes. I was given the grits by mistake but took the opportunity to try them. They were creamy and seasoned to perfection. What else was seasoned to perfection? Those dang potatoes! Holy cow they were flavorful. *chef's kiss*\n\nIf you are on the fence about going for brunch or any other meal, GO! They are enforcing social distancing inside and have included tables outside in case you feel more comfortable.",

I then consolidated the orders and called back to order....some people just don't want to work I guess because they're too \"overwhelmed\" by regular life at a job. I work at an ER but we don't have that option to say stop...we just keep on keeping on...grow up Manuel's or get new peeps to answer the phone because I'm not EVER ordering or going to Manuel's again, which is a shame since I used to drop by after getting off a long day(s) at Grady...",
