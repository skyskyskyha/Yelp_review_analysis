                "text": "A unique menu that blends cultures in a refreshing and yummy way without being overly expensive, with good cocktails too. \n\nMy team and I ordered every dish on the menu and tried two of the three available desserts. Highlights for me: \n- lamb meatball, just really good flavor\n- apple chicken, tender and well seasoned\n- blondies and milk, damn that was good if you like sweets\n\nOther dishes:\n- apple carrot sorbet was a nice, less sweet, very refreshing way to end the meal\n- the soup we had was like a sour cabbage stew with a raw egg mixed in, I liked it but some coworkers didn't\n- chicken liver custard, the liver had a gelatinous covering and was a DIY assembly with a little crepe (my coworker refused to call it a blintz), the liver itself was good but I didn't need the fermented veggies or sauce or crepe with it to enjoy it \n- beef tartar was yummy but not like so standout above other tartar I've had \n\nThe pet semetary cocktail sounds death defying but was actually pretty good, sunspot was bright and easy to drink and the chili oil was an excellent addition to keep sips interesting. \n\nService was great! The dining area itself is not too dim (which I hate), but not a ton of dining space. There's a bar to sit at as well. A nice ambiance for taking your parents out, a date. our large table of 8 coworkers was kind of an anomaly but welcomed by the servers warmly",

In regard to the menu, it's very different and filled with character. If you're a picky eater this definitely isn't the restaurant for you. In my honest opinion the food was 3 stars for me, but the service made me go with 4 stars. In all the meals there was a lot going on, a little bit chaotic. I'll honestly probably come back just to try a few more dishes and give them another try. But it's not going to be a rush. \n\nYou're welcome!",

I'd highly recommend reservations in advance, due to availability.  Our server knew the menu well and also was a great guide for culinary ordering.   The food was great - plenty of vegan options and plant based protein. I'm not a fan of organ meat - so we played it safe with the delicious chicken.  I'd have one recommendation- to incorporate some seafood on the menu.   Perhaps that happens when the menu changes - so stayed tuned ! I think I'd recommend taking a Lyft to not have to fuss with parking.",

The aesthetic was appealing so we gotta seat at the bar to try it out. Wasn't super hungry, so we wanted to just eat light and have a delicious cocktail. \nWe parked in a lot across the way (near Publix), restaurant seating was full but there were two seats at the bar. We were greeted by a lovely young lady with great energy. She gave us the run down of the menu and it was super helpful. Opted to get the cauliflower dish, and boy did it amaze! Easily one of the BEST made vegetarian-based dish I've had all year (and I'm vegetarian lol). And watching the cook plate was like watching an artist (perks of bar seating). I also got a cocktail called \nIt was delicious and the tomato wasn't really even noticed (I was originally concerned cause I don't like tomatoes juice). It was called the Motorbike. So delicious and refreshing. \n\nI will definitely be back because the care in cooking and playing, deliciously crafted cocktails, it's bound to be a delightful experience everytime.",

We didn't make a reservation as there was limited seating on a weeknight but they did tell us we would be able to walk in and sit at the bar.  They gave us a wait time and were able to accommodate a small sitting area in the corner, although we did have to wait a while for a barstool seat.  We did the dealers choice which they were also able to accommodate any food restrictions and provide various dishes from the menu.  We also got to order mocktails which they gave us a couple of different types of flavors to choose from.  The dealers choice included the soup, salad, the main course which was a chicken dish (they substituted a vegetarian item) for vegetarians and a dessert.  Each item was so unique in its ingredients and pairings.  The flavors were truly memorable and a great experience. My parents really enjoyed it as well!",

But actually here is DELICIOUS. There's nothing pretentious about this restaurant. Even the prices. It's delicious and has thoughtful eats that push you to try new things. I've always had great service here and I've always loved the feeling that this spot has. Look for their IG and that will give you a better idea of what's on the menu and their overall personality. \n\nIt's one of my top threes in Atlanta. Make a reservation. It stays booked and it's hard to even get a bar seat without reservations. Summerhill oddly has valet now or you can search for street parking. There are a couple of lots around too but feels like the area is so busy now that spots are hard to get.",

I ended up ordering everything on this menu and I did not regret it. The portion sizes were perfect for exploration and ordering a whole menu is always my ideal situation. The fact it was achievable here was already a big win for me. \n\nLet me tell you something... let me tell you something... the atmosphere in this restaurant is absolute fire. The staff were so much fun and at one point almost everyone in the restaurant (staff and patrons) were singing a song that was playing (I think it was 'we were meant to live' by Switchfoot). \n\nThis tiny, intimate, chill spot is so good that I may plan a quick trip to ATL in 2023 just to try it again.",

I'll say the decor is more of a coffee shop than a cool restaurant, so that's a little odd, but it's a cute space regardless.\n\nService is friendly and helpful. They are quick and willing to provide great recommendations to the food and drink experience. We were suggested to order everything upfront and I did have to tell them to slow it down because the food was coming out too fast. As a party of two, we ordered 5 savory dishes, which was sufficient and maybe one dish too many. Dishes change often, but we loved everything! Dishes range from 13-18 dollars.\n\nThe cocktails are interesting but delicious. The wine menu is super fun too. Four drinks, five dishes, and one dessert later, it ran us about $150 total.\n\nWould definitely return. Well done!",

I had dinner here on 7/17/2022 with a party of 5. We made a reservation via Resy and were seated in a nice spot right next to the window. \n\nThe menu is on the smaller side so we decided we would try everything on it. \n\nOur server (Rachel) was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. \n\nFor food and drinks we had (literally everything):\n-Booze pack - made us all custom drinks with liquor of choice , wines\n-Chill'd Cucumber & Vidalia Soup - I thought it was good gazpacho cold soup  \n-Lettuce salad - it was ok, strange flavors, crunchy seeds too much \n-Chix Liver Custard - Really good, one of the groups favorites but is spicy\n-Heirloom 'Materz - average, was ok \n-Mala Raw Beef - really good, made gluten free pretzels on the side \n-Potato and peach - good not super herby like stated on the menu\n-Sweet 'n Sauer Pork - liked this a lot!\n-Nectarine chicken - was the best for flavor - corn starch slurry is used so this is gluten free\n-Meat du Jour\n-All 3 sweet dishes\n\nI would say the plates are small enough so if you want the full experience you won't have too much food to try one of everything if sharing with a group of 4 or more.\n\nGLUTEN FREE TIPS*\nThe Little Bear website states: \n\"Vegetarian/Vegan, Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Nut Free and most other standard allergies or dietary restrictions can be accommodated nightly.\"\nI found the staff to be very knowledgeable in gluten free items and I was able to enjoy almost the entire menu except for some of the sweet dishes.\n\nI would highly recommend Little Bear for a fun night out with friends and an experience where you can try lots of different dishes.\n\n*As of November 2021 my reviews are written from a celiac, gluten free perspective. I recommend researching online (like the Find Me Gluten Free app) and calling ahead for your own personal needs.",

                "text": "I'd give this place a 4.5 if I could but rounded up because three of dishes were really excellent, the cocktails were solid, and service friendly and on point. I also love the inviting chill vibe, and that even though we arrived 45 min before closing, the staff didn't rush us out. \n\nFOOD:  \n- Mala Raw Beef:  really well seasoned with pretzel chip seasonings and a touch of heat, and served on top of raw beet(?) chips, this was really innovative but a burst of flavor.  I found this very inspired. \n- Pumpkin Salad:  when it arrived we thought it was a bbq meat because it had been glazed and roasted to perfection. It transformed the pumpkin into an unctuous rich main. It was pretty incredible. \n- Pecan Pao Chicken:  very well seasoned, do wish it had dark rather than white meat, but really quite good \n- Liver Custard:  this was the only miss--served with lettuce cups and very sour pickles, these flavors didn't really go together \n\nRum Old Fashioned and Tuxedo T Shirt and Tuscaloosa are excellent cocktails. I found La Llorama disappointing though as it just tastes mainly of ginger beer. \n\nAll in all, an innovative, satisfying, and fun meal. Can't wait to come back!",

We were able to get reservations on a Saturday about three weeks out- the wait was beyond worth it. We can't get over how delicious and thoughtful each plate we ordered.\n\nThe small plates are all so unique. Our favorite was the peach & potatoes, the flavors were incredible and the ingredients were fresh. This place is top notch.\n\nWe also loved the service and ambiance. The bathrooms are super chic with funky lights, the dining area has really cool wallpaper and gorgeous plants you can take home with you for a small purchase. \n\nWe will be back a million times over. I'm already looking for when we can get in again!",

Service was extremely rushed, the server didn't even look at us or explain any of the dishes. The courses were fine except the Lettuce Salad, which was overdressed and flat. The chicken dish was excellent, and the redeeming feature of the night. All portions were small and I left still hungry. I would give it 1 star, but I'm giving it an extra for its cute mascot dog and the presentation of each dish. Will not go back though -- and our party came to a consensus that it is certainly undeserving of a spot on the Michelin Guide.",

                "text": "Finally made it to Little Bear!  Cute!!! Reminds me of a resto I would find in Park Slope, Brooklyn.  The service was great and the food was flavorful. \n\nPictured: the Heirloom tomatoes. Such a pretty plate. The Mala Raw Beef was delicious. Think beef tartare. One of my favorite tartares now.  So good!!!!Love the daikon as it provided some crunch. \n\nWe also had the meat du Jour which was a brisket.  It was perfectly cooked.  Everything was so delicious!!! \n\nOne thing about the menu, it changes often. Also, when we dined, there was maybe one carb options. Can't recall what they had.  I recall wanted some carb options. Perhaps they kept it lighter due to the season? I don't know.  I'll have to come back again during the fall/winter to see how the menu compares. \n\nParking can be tricky depending on time of day. There's limited parking in the back of the resto and there's also street parking. \n\nReservations are a must! It's a small restaurant but it has a nice huge bar.",

For someone who loves crafted cocktails, after every sip, I winced while my taste buds were kicking and screaming in dissatisfaction. Second, food should at least be served lukewarm (and thats generous). The three dishes ordered were all consistently chilled as if they had been sitting on the line for an hour with no heat lamp. The pace at which the food came out was very rushed. The table became crowded (which was shocking with how small the portions were), and the flavors did not pair well. We tried to chop it up to having the last reservation of the night, but after diving into other reviews (post the experience), we see that cold food at Little Bear is a common theme. Do not come with the expectation you will receive a hot meal. The flavors of the dishes weren't actually there. Must have been left behind with the warmth of the meal. Also, don't waste time mentioning you are there for a special occasion in your reservation because there will be ZERO acknowledgement of that special occasion. \n\nIn light of the negative review, the service was actually up to par, but became awkward as we were continuously asked how we enjoyed the meal. Ambience was great. Can't say I will tell others to go here. Sadly disappointed and extremely confused about the hype for this restaurant. Go to Woodys if you're looking for a hot meal and want to feel full afterwards.",

                "text": "We had a lovely Sunday evening at Little Bear with our group of five. Our waitress was super helpful, and suggested we could all share one of everything on the \"savory\" menu except the soup (which would be hard to split). So we ordered the 7 items that they had on the menu that day, and found something to enjoy in all of them. Including the chicken liver, which the vast majority of us would have never ordered off the menu. It wasn't my favorite item, but there wasn't a bad thing on the menu, period. The table's favorites included the chicken, beef, and pork sausage menu items, and though we also enjoyed all the veggie dishes, the ones with meat just seemed to have more flavor. We then went on to split all 3 desserts, and the chocolate torte was the favorite of most, with the blondie coming in second place. \n\nSplitting the savory menu and all 3 desserts was enough food for 5 people, and for a nice farm-to-table restaurant, the price was not prohibitive. We each had a cocktail, and it was about $40 a person before tip. I was not stuffed, but I was satisfied. I did have room to get ice cream across the street at Big Softie afterward. I have a separate dessert stomach, so sue me. The service was extremely fast, and we were finished with everything within an hour and 15 minutes. I could not believe the speed at which they brought the food after we ordered. I highly recommend you make a reservation here - it's way too small to accommodate people without them. We found street parking, but our friends parked in a nearby lot. I'd definitely recommend this place!",

I had the numbing pastrami chicken which was essentially a fried chicken with some kiss a$$ seasoning. The bok choy was very complementary although there were barely any pieces of the oyster mushroom.  Skimpy on the ingredients and I wouldn't rank this highly on my fried chicken list.  The egg drop soup was if hot and sour soup had a baby with egg drop soup.  Not bad but also not worth the price.  Also- the dealer's choice only saves you $1 which I thought was hilarious. \nDid not care for my Ayran Fizz cocktail much.\nThe bathroom is out of this world- like it took my eyes so long to adjust to the bright pink and it was unnecessary.\nOverall, pretty overpriced to still leave a bit hungry.",

                "text": "Sad to say that this was a very disappointing dining experience. I came here on a Sunday evening to celebrate my birthday after reading the incredible reviews on yelp about what this unique little spot had to offer. Upon walking in, I was so excited! I was ready to try both the four course prefix \"Dealer's Choice\" and the drink package because I had read about how great it was. We sat down, and to start, it was beyond freezing cold. Everyone in my party was shivering. We received waters and then waiting for quite sometime to ever be asked about anything more.\n  I ordered the\"Booze Pack\" which included four beverages. I received an off menu cocktail for my first beverage, which had very clearly been sitting at the bar for too long before being served because the glass was sweating and the drink was so watered down by the ice I could barely taste it until the last two sips. When we finally ordered food I asked for the four course and the rest of my party all just ordered a single plate. This seemingly confused the waitress because she tried to get them to order more but we explained that it was okay and I just wanted to try it all. My first dish came out, it was the Summery as Hell Chilled Soup, that I enjoyed the first few bites of, however after a while it started tasting more and more like an Italian salad dressing. My second dish was a salad called Lettuce (the two least expensive items on the menu at the time..), the salad had a lot of unique flavors but was highly overdressed. Both of these plates arrived at the same time which ended up crowding the table. My second drink was a glass of white wine which could not have been more than a four ounce pour. This wine also arrived while my first drink was still on the table. My third plate arrived with both my second and first dishes still unfinished on the table which was very frustrating, because again, there was no room. The third dish was the most disappointing. I was so excited to try this Pecan Pao Chicken. While the chicken was fried well, it lacked any flavor at all, the garnish and veggies on the side of the plate were bland and did not add anything to the dish. There was also supposed to be celery za'atar in this dish somewhere and myself and another guest I was dining with couldn't taste anything that resembled Za'atar. As you might have assumed by now my third drink was brought to the table during my third dish even though my second had not been finished yet. It was another very small glass of wine, this time a Pinot Nior, filled with sediment. It was truly terrible. Final dish was the Cream Custard dessert, and while quite small, it was the dish that had the most flavor and was the most unique. Same with my final drink, a single ounce pour of a nightcap, delicious but barely even a sip. \n At the end of the dinner, I was heartbroken. I had hyped up this meal and place so much to my boyfriend and family I came with and was left feeling so underwhelmed. Service felt extremely rush, and for no good reason considering they didn't have another dinner seating until 9pm (we arrived at 7pm and all of the plates had been rushed out, eaten, and cleared by 8pm). Another note on the service, we were barely ever asked if we were enjoying or needed anything, not to mention that we had included that it was my birthday in the reservation? If you're not going to even bother to say \"happy birthday\" or \"congratulations\" when someone includes that it's a special occasion in the reservation, why even ask? \n I would love to give this place another shot if there was a dish on the menu that looked exciting enough for me to try but I would never suggest getting the drink package for the prefix menu. Compared to the menu prices, it really isn't much of a deal and then you'll get to pick exactly what you like. My sister in law had the Surf 'n Turf and loved it so maybe I was just unlucky with the choices the dealer made. I felt ripped off and unsatisfied walking out. Glad everyone else had great experiences but I cannot say the same.",

But I've become a fan of those foods each time after leaving. The atmosphere is casual enough that you can pop in (if that's your fancy), and inviting enough to stay for a while (and you likely will). It's a unique & ummm... self-aware (?) menu every time, that is both fresh and surprising. Not a bad dish or drink in my experience.\n\nYou get what you pay for. This is not a Cracker Barrel m, so you likely won't leave the restaurant as stuffed as you ever have been. BUT... you will leave feeling like you experienced something different and very, very tasty.",

Since one of us is a pescatarian, we decided to do a la carte and ordered most of the things on the menu along with some cocktails and one \"booze pack\" (it was me, I ordered the booze pack).\nThe menu descriptions are amusing (\"unnecessary garnishes\"!) and the dishes are solid-the mala raw beef was particularly fun, but everything was delicious. I definitely recommend just getting everything.\nService was friendly, helpful, and accommodating to our non-carnivore. A lovely little spot for a delicious meal without tons of pretentiousness and incredibly, incredibly reasonable prices.",

My husband and I ordered 4-5 small plates and everything was delicious and fresh.

                "text": "Little Bear is a great place for those with adventurous taste buds and appreciation for culinary courage... apparently neither of which I have. The food is best described as a unique fusion between asian and Jewish cuisine. Unfortunately, most of the dishes did not sound particularly appetizing to me and were equally unappealing to my taste buds when they came out. They were certainly beautiful, well plated and the experience was quite interesting, but I can safely say I'm not a fan of this type of fusion and will be steering away from it in the future. \n\nOf note, the menu does rotate throughout the year but I can safely say I maybe enjoyed 2/7 courses. I was excited for the dessert but it ended up being a very heavy and rich chocolate mousse that I couldn't finish. Overall, I wouldn't write this restaurant off as being terrible because I can maybe see patrons with more bold taste buds enjoying this experience. It may be helpful to look at the menu beforehand and decide if anything sounds appetizing to you first though...",

It is by far some of the best food in Atlanta, and beyond. \n\nWe went for a belated Valentines dinner last night so treated ourselves to nearly one of everything to share. This was one of the best meals I've had in years. The shiitake soup was my favorite, and my partner's was the chicken. Which was funny because those were the two we almost didn't order! Every single dish we had was absolutely delicious. \n\nI will admit that the one miss for me is the cocktails. They are just too sweet. Even a basic old fashioned came out sweet. If you like sweet cocktails this will be a hit for you, but otherwise maybe stick to beer and wine. \n\nThe service is always fantastic and friendly. The ambiance is more casual than you'd expect. You'll see people dressed down and up - so come how you are and enjoy a great meal!",

I think the beet-flavored cocktail was delicious as well, I think I ordered 3 of them during the course of our meal the first time I went. \n\nOn my first visit, my party and I were not informed of the 2 hour dining time when we were seated, and were also not reminded about it at the 90 minute mark. When we tried ordering dessert, the waitstaff stated we couldn't, which kind of made it a sour ending to the dining experience. \n\nThe owner of the restaurant was so nice and responsive to our feedback, and offered us a free round of drinks and dessert the next time we came in. \n\nThe second time we came, we were again blown away with the food and drinks. And not only did we get our first round of cocktails and desserts for free, they comped our whole meal! They went above and beyond in my book, and I'll keep raving about this place. \n\nThe chicken thigh is so delicious, definitely get it.",

The space of the restaurant itself is not very big and it can almost feel a bit cramped depending on where you are sitting. I did like that there was lots of lighting though. \n    I sat at a table and ordered the Beet Egg Drop Soup, Wild Catfish Okonomiyaki, and the Chicken with explosive chile flavor to eat. The Woodear mushrooms in the soup were nice but that was about it. The soup itself was extremely bland and tasted like lightly flavored water. The Wild Catfish Okonomiyaki was just meh and I am still searching for the alleged explosive flavor in the chicken dish. I can't recall the name of the cocktail I had but it was whiskey-based and I will say that it was good. Needless to say, I was severely underwhelmed with my visit so based on my experience I would not recommend this spot.",

                "text": "I'm so happy we stumbled on this little gem! This was honestly one of the best meals I have ever had! We came here on a Saturday evening and they were all booked out for dinner, but they let us sit at the bar. I honestly preferred this as you were able to watch the bartender make drinks and the chef cooked everything right in front of you. With the open kitchen, you could watch as the chef assembled the dishes one by one and the care and precision that went into each one.\n\nThe dining experience was so much fun and full of personality as their serving plates had New Yorker comics printed on them. Our server and the bartender were also very attentive, constantly checking in and refilling our water. We shared the eggplant dish which was nice and flavorful. We also ordered the chicken thigh which was cooked beautifully and perfectly juicy inside. The peppers were roasted nicely as well and I could not get enough of the sauce that it came with. Each dish was pretty cheap but portion sizes aren't very large. For dessert, we had a black & white torte, which had a rich chocolate flavor.\n\nOverall, dinner was such a phenomenal experience from the food to the interior to the service. My only regret is that I was not able to try more dishes, I definitely want to come back and try their prix fixe.",

Each one is a unique and masterful blend of flavors, textures, and aromas that come together to create an experience that is truly one-of-a-kind.\n\nThis Atlanta gem is the result of the passion and vision of owners Jarrett Stieber and his wife Hallie, who transformed an abandoned building into a thriving eatery that stands out in the city's dining scene. The warm hospitality of Jarrett and his furry mascot and friend Fernando is a testament to the couple's commitment to creating an atmosphere of inclusiveness and community.\nThe menu's standout dish, the sweet-and-sour chicken, has the power to evoke emotions and memories, but it's the cocktails that will truly take your breath away. Each one is a work of art, carefully crafted to deliver a spectrum of flavors that you've never experienced before. \n\nWhether you're a connoisseur or simply looking for a unique and delicious drink, the bar at Little Bear will not disappoint.\nFor those in search of an epicurean adventure that will tantalize the taste buds and lift the soul, Little Bear is a must-visit.

                "text": "I can't remember where I heard about Little Bear, but I knew when my boyfriends parents came to town, we had to take them here. Flaunting a Jewish-Szechuan menu and punchy descriptions, I knew it would be a hit. And it was! \n\nAs a group of 4, we tried every item on the food menu except for the Black Rice Pudding because of an allergy. I would've liked to have a little more choice, especially since some dishes didn't excite us that much, but it was plenty to feed our group. I can't imagine this restaurant comfortably accommodates tables of more than 4, though. \n\nOur favorite items were the Beef & Congee, Broccoli, & Holishkes. The Beef & Congee had an amazing texture, and the slices of beef were thin and delicious. The chili crisp was also fantastic (didn't pick up the hint of cocoa butter, though). The Broccoli was crunchy, salty, and slightly sweet with the chocolate strange sauce. Everything about this dish was amazing! The Holishkes were an unexpected favorite -- I don't like gefilte fish, but it didn't taste like that at all? Not sure what the \"gefilte\" meant, but the flavor to me was just the crisp cabbage + herbs with a paprikash sauce and crunchy rice.\n\nWe didn't love the Egg Drop Ciora -- it was a little hard to share between the four of us, and we were thoroughly confused about what \"green apple za'atar buttermilk\" was or where it played into the dish. The Chix Liver Custard was okay, more of a pat\u00e9, and I've never been a fan of gel\u00e9e (the gelatin layer on top) but alas. If you like chicken liver custard, try it (and still try it if you've never had it !) but it won't be how you remember grandma making it. The Matzo Fritters also let us down a bit -- they weren't crispy like we were hoping. In fact, they were a little soggy. The flavors were great and the HERBS were beautiful but I really wanted the crunch reminiscent of a latke. \n\nFor drinks, I had the sherry cobbler which was so good! It was very lemon-y, not too sweet, and fantastic with all the food! The Ayran Fizz was also right up my alley. These were the \"least boozy\" drinks of the table, so take that as you will! \n\nThe menu rotates seasonally, so the dishes we tried may not be available when you visit, but hopefully the above gives you an idea for their flavor profiles! Bold and adventurous eaters will love it, others may vary!\n\nFinally, our service was great. We arrived about 15 mins late due to an Uber mixup, but made sure to let the restaurant know and they were very understanding. Our server was friendly but not super knowledgeable -- we needed help knowing how much to order, and he didn't have the best guidance. Another server came by and she was the one to take our order (not sure why the mixup?) and she was just like \"yeah, you need to order everything + the XL meat, it's the only way.\" So we did! We ended up being the last table due to arriving late, but they didn't rush us out and it was cool to chat with the staff at the end of the night as we were leaving. A really friendly group, doing really cool and creative things at this restaurant!",

What a pleasant surprise Little Bear is.\n\nWe got here around an hour before closing so I was worried they would try to rush us, but no. They were still friendly and treated us well.\n\n_ Mala Raw Beef, nardello pepper, choi, LB mayo, pretzel chip seasoning, veg planks, unnecessary garnishes 15\n\nThis isn't for everyone. I don't mind eating raw beef and Little Bear delivered here. It was really good, really fresh, and had a nice little kick. 10/10 would order again.\n\n_ Pecan Pao Chicken, chermoulah labneh sauce, eggplant, sweet pepper, cress, aj\u00ed chili, cilantro, celery za'atar 16\n\nThe flavor on the chicken was OUTSTANDING. The eggplant wasn't mushy, but still nicely served. The presentation was great and there was a nice amount of chicken for the two of us to share. We came in knowing that we were going to share everything, so we got 4 total plates of things. Don't expect to be full from just one plate. There was a complex mix of flavors and while I didn't exactly get the za'atar seasoning, it was absolutely divine overall.\n\nOkra, apple, horseradish yogurt, 'texas pet's' hot sauce, cured egg yolk, herbs out the ass 12\n\nMy partner's favorite. He LOVES okra and for good reason, this was addicting. I loved everything about it too.\n\n_ Black Rice Puddin,' peach, vanilla, benne, pretentious flowers 9\n\nWe don't normally get desserts when we go out to eat, but we were having a lovely date night so decided to do so. This was REALLY good. It was nice and warm, the sweetness of the peach and vanilla really came through beautifully. I love that this was on the menu because I feel like normally, people might go for the blondies or custard. \n\n_ Tuscaloosa bourbon, sloeberry, LB pecan amoretto, lemon, angostura 12\n\nVERY delicious cocktail. I took the first sip and fell in love. It was very refreshing, but I also do love anything with bourbon.",
