Flavorful and just the right amount of spice (but I couldn't have done any more). My husband had the lamb curry and that was good as well, although the portion was smaller than my dish. We also had an order of garlic naan which came with 4 pieces. If you were really hungry you may want your own order of naan.\n\nI would say service was adequate and the place itself is cute.\n\nParking: The validate parking for the garage attached to the building.",

Lots of seating and you can see through the window in the kitchen them making the naan! Recommend making a reservation, can get busy. \n \nFood/price: we liked that they have options on here that aren't typically seen at other places. A bit pricey for the portion size. Group of 7 shared:\n \nMasala Fries ($5): shoestring fries tossed in house spices serviced with house curry ranch and ketchup. Enjoyed the seasoning on the fries, pretty good portion size too for the price! The ranch was very tasty.\n \nJuhu Beach Bhel ($8): puffed rice, sev, onions, potatoes, cilantro, tamarind chutney. Served cold, the puffed rice reminds of the rice krispy rice but more airy. It was a refreshing and interesting.\n \nSaag Paneer ($17): spinach, cream, house spices, paneer; served with steamed basmati rice. We always order this any time we go to an Indian restaurant, can't really go wrong with this one!\n \nLamb Vindaloo ($21); braised in red wine vinegar with Kashmiri chilis, lamb; served with steamed basmati rice. Surprisingly, we didn't enjoy this as much. We asked for this spicy, wasn't as spicy as we thought it would be - the sauce tasted almost ketchup-y, maybe from the acid of the vinegar. There were quite a few chunks of potato in there, it was almost half the dish so not as many lamb pieces as expected.\n \nFish Moilee ($19): white fish in a Kerala-style fragrant coconut, coriander, and black pepper curry; served with rice. First time trying this and our group really liked it.\n \nChole Bhature ($16); Punjabi style chickpeas, corn kernels, served with fluffy fried leavened bread. Also a winner amongst the group. The fluffy bread tasted almost like the Native American fry bread which I really love and paired really well with the chole.\n \nSaffron Butter Chicken ($19): cubed chicken thighs in a creamy-saffron butter sauce. We asked for this mild because we wanted one of the kids to be able to eat it. I think this would be better at a higher spice level because it is inherently sweet.\n \nGarlic Naan ($6): garlic and cilantro, comes with 6 cut pieces. We had to order another basket to share amongst the 6 of us, it was very good though so can't complain.\n \nTLDR: recommend garlic naan, fish moilee, saag paneer, chole bhature entrees!",

Furthermore, the restaurant is gorgeous and the ambiance is amazing!\n\nIt was my little brother's birthday and I wanted to try something new. Blue India has been on my list for a while as the reviews are very positive. I can honestly say that the reviews are true. The staff, the food, the environment, the aromas, everything as a whole is amazing. \n\nAs it was a group of us we decided to get a selection of items on the menu. With this approach everyone was able to eat off of everything and get a feel for the overall selection of Blue India. \n\nIt's no secret that I am a lover of Naan bread and babeeeeeeeeeee. Even though all the food selections were amazing, the Garlic Naan bread STOLE THE SHOW for me!!! I'm talking warm, soft, buttery, crispy edges, and a garlic profile that was spot on. I want moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!\n\nAs we were engaged in the fellowship of good times, great vibes, and great food, I was unable to take my pics as I normally do. However, what I will say to you is... Try Everything. LoL!!!!",

I ate off it for about 3 days. \n\nI ordered Tiki Masala, Kochi Beef Curry, Chili Salmon Bites, cheddar Naan and a ginger beer! I was happy to see the ginger beer from Jamaica! All items were delicious, very savory and just traditional Indian spices. So far the restaurants I've tried all taste very similar however I thought this location would be a tad unique when I saw British Indian. Next I have to try Tabla in Buckhead. \n\nMy favorite was of course the Tiki Masala however the Kochi Beef was so tasty as well! I will order again from here for sure and recommend you to try as well!",

The establishment maintained impeccable cleanliness and the staff provided exceptional service. Although we arrived later than planned, the waitstaff graciously accommodated us, allowing us to savor our meal unhurriedly, which was much appreciated. I opted for the vegan aloo gobi curry, and we started with the masala fries and samosa appetizers, both of which were delicious. Having resided in Atlanta for over 18 years, I can confidently say this is one of the finest Indian restaurants I've experienced, and I eagerly anticipate my next visit. The food here reminded me of my trip to London when I ate at a restaurant called the Bengal Clipper. The establishment is no longer but I was shocked at how accurate the British Indian restaurant, Blue India retained the familiarity and authenticity of Indian and English flavours.",

Service was great, ordered pretty quickly and the food did not disappoint. The ambiance is causal vibe. The coolest part is a glass window near the clay oven so you can watch naan and paratha etc being prepared. \n\n\nWhat we ordered;\n\nPeshwari Naan 5/5 - Sweet, savory and baked to perfection.\n\nGarlic Naan - 4/5 I thought it should have a little more garlic but good.\n\nLamb Tikka Masala  5/5- Tender, juicy & well seasoned.\n\nChicken Biryani - 4/5 Tasty, next time I'll add little more spice.\n\nSamosa -4/5 Tasty but not as flaky as I like.",

When we asked an employee to take our picture, she politely declined. That was a first for me. \n\nThe food was delicious. We got the samosas and fries. The fries came with curry ranch and that was a nice surprise. If you have two people ordering the same dish, you'll get one plate of rice to share. \n\nMy friend got roti with his order and he was not a fan, so I recommend getting the garlic naan instead. I asked the server their favorite and they responded with the chicken tikka so I got that. Definitely did not disappoint. You can order the spice level you want for certain dishes. My palette isn't made for spicy anymore, but great options. \n\nI'm glad I tried this spot.",

I'm a huge fan of the tikka masala, garlic naan, and chicken 65. Very flavorful, and delicious over rice. The garlic naan is buttery and garlicky, more soft than crispy. The samosas are a little starchy and dry for me so I might not get those again, I think they only have vegetable samosas here. They validate parking for 2 hours at the parking garage nearby which is super convenient. Service was good, food came out relatively quickly, and staff was great. It has a clean and modern vibe, overall nice establishment and would probably get Indian food from here again.",

We ordered quite a few things because we like to try as many things as possible and we really liked every single dish. What I especially liked was that we had options to order different spice levels. We both ordered the lowest level, but we realized we could've gotten the second level because the food wasn't spicy at all. \n\nBtw, there is an attached garage you can park at and get 2 hours validated by the restaurant if you give then your ticket!",

We definitely got lucky both times getting a table but on my 3rd time trying to go (key word: trying) the hostess was not pleased we didn't have a reservation and quoted 45 minutes but didn't seem sure about it lol\n\nEither way, started our meal with some chicken 65 which is a classic appetizer! It tasted amazing and as expected and thoroughly enjoyed it. For my main, I got the chicken biryani with mild spice and omg. This container they gave me for the price was MASSIVE!!! Going forward, I plan to split it bc it is an absurdly huge thing of rice and tasted amazing and the spice was great and the chicken was so tender. My favorite thing. We always order a couple orders of naan, some garlic some plain and their naan is delicious! For the price, this place is high quality Indian food and they give a huge quantity. 10/10 for Indian food in midtown Atlanta",

Quantity was also perfect for five people. Prices are also like any other indian restaurants. We came an hour before closing and we were able to order everything we wanted (except dessert but that was also okay bc we were soo full from the food). The restaurant had good vibes and a great place to just sit and eat. Highly highly recommend when you're in the downtown Atlanta area!!",

DO NOT !!!!\nTried to make the best of it but the food was so oily and gross I was scared to try continue for fear of spending the rest of the night on the toilet.\nOMG -- the WORST Indian food I've ever had the displeasure of seeing.",

We ordered crispy bhindi fries, papdi chaat, malai kofta, peshavari naan and garlic naan. The flavors were to the point and exceeded our expectations for most of the items but didnt much care for the fresh lime soda and the peshavari Naan. Peshavari naan was very sweet, felt like I have having a dessert with kofta. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 since I think they can do better with the cleanliness around, the bathrooms had slippery floors and cockroaches. I was scared to eat here after seeing the condition of the bathroom. We were happy with the flavors of the food but the food didn't sit well for both me and husband, we both had an upset stomach. \nThe waitress was polite and gave us a free dessert for my bday",

The garlic naan was spot on and I like that there were crispy pieces of onion on the rice which was different! To be a greedy person, I do wish there was more chicken in the curry but I'm still very happy with my dish. I picked this place for dinner and everyone liked their food so that was a success! The customer service was so amazing! They enjoyed my 3 month old who did so good during our time there (our server mentioned that to my mom while she waited for me to pull the car around). One of the workers even opened the car door for my mom so she could put my son's car seat in the car. That generosity will be remembered. I will definitely come back again and explore more of the menu and drink menu!",

Living in Atlanta, especially OTP I think we have gotten spoiled by the plethora of excellent, authentic and regional Indian restaurants serving tasty food at reasonable prices. The only reason we tried this place was because we had friends in town attending a conference downtown. I would only go here if you are restricted to the downtown/midtown area and Tabla is closed!  Service was fine, ambiance is a bit cramped, food was good but not great and they were out of several drinks we tried to order. In a pinch, it'll do or if you've never had Indian food - otherwise, go to Decatur or other suburbs for better and less expensive options.",

Classic, thin naan w light garlic. Hard to mess up, but delicious none the less. 5/5\n\nChicken 65: This was a breaded spicy chicken that was well marinated and flavored. This chicken did have a notable spice, but nothing crazy. 4/5\n\nChicken Tikka: Really good, creamy and served w basmati rice.

When I opened the first item it was extremely hard and it had a roach in the bottom of the box. Boy was I piss!! So not trying to discourage anyone if this is your go to spot. If this is your favorite restaurant then so bit it, continue. What's a little roach however just be mindful. I threw everything away that I ordered.

The place is a bit trendy inside with dark decor, and you can see the two ovens used to make the breads which is a great feature. The breading for the samosas was firm not flaky and the filling was standard in terms of flavors. The masala fries were an interesting twist on an American classic. I was expecting to have curry filled with a plethora of spice so I was a little surprised to taste the curries and find it seemed a little flat, like it was missing a bit of coriander and/or cumin. Each was definitely mild, not spicy although I was never asked about spice level either. The curries were nicely blended and smooth. Service was okay, and they seemed to have enough servers for the customer base at the time we dined, which was Friday dinnertime. I did think the tables were too small because we had trouble with putting all the dishes on the table. It got worse when we packed up. I had to put some of the empties on the seat which is not ideal and I was lucky the table next to me was free. They also gave me a plastic bag instead of paper which they had available as I saw them give other people paper. So my items were a little unstable in my bag.",

Without question...this was the absolute most disgusting concoction of food I have ever....in all my years of global travel, ever seen much less tried to consume. It was utterly inedible, both orders of curry in their containers were under 2 solid inches of oil, the naan, if you can call it that was absolutely drenched in oil as well. Not sure what it's like dining in, but if this is what they put in the food, you may want to look elsewhere, or choose to have a VERY difficult next several hours. \nAdditionally, if a delivery order is scheduled, put some eating utensils in the order, especially if delivered to a hotel. I can only imagine if they are cutting corners on a .25 plastic utensil how much they are cutting corners on the food, cleanliness and staff. One way or another, I list this as a never, ever again.",

People dining in are a priority and after 45 minutes of waiting...you should be ashamed. The other food we actually did receive was good. But the restaurant also doesn't seem to have heating and in the cold weather our food was a little cold. We froze our butts off while eating here. Won't be back! This place was good....i see the star count slowly going down. It's likely their service because the food is ok. Not the best in Atlanta but ok.",
