        "text": "Bully Boy is tucked tightly away next to Two Urban Licks and right by the belt line (Ponce City). We made a reservation randomly and they have plenty of times/reservations to choose from.\n\nService was impeccable from start to finish. Not sure why it's called Bully when the service was nothing but nice folks. But I ain't complaining none.\n\nParking can be iffy, but they do have valet and self parking areas. I chose to do self parking and found it pretty easy to navigate.\n\nFood was great, slightly salty in some bites but overall it was enjoyable. Dishes came out in a timely manner and the online menu made it easy to both order and pay at the end. Portions are meant to be shared, and that ain't an understatement. Between my wife and I, we chose different dishes to try and were not disappointed. \n\nVibe is great, very chill or great for a dress up date spot. Plenty of drinks to choose from if that's your poison.\n\nOverall, definitely would like to come back and I can easily recommend this spot to others to try.",

        "text": "To start off, the food was amazing and worth the price you pay. I opted for the King Kong Roll and the starter or Beef Gyoza. The taste of the Gyoza's were amazing. Honestly wish I had ordered more. And the King Kong Roll was very tasty and crafted well. \n\nThe service was great. The staff was very attentive and polite. Also the decor and the space entirely was very intimate. Loved every part of this done in experience. I cannot wait to come back to try some other menu items that peaked my interest. \n\nTwo things that weren't too great was, the entrance to the restaurant was hard to find. My friends and I went back and forth trying to find the front which looked like an employee back door. And the worst part was the valet service. If I could leave them their own personal review I would. But valet was terrible!",

        "text": "Nobody would have to bully this boy to come back here.\n\nWe had a great experience here on a Friday night. After we got stuck in a little traffic, we called the restaurant to let them know we were running late for our reservation and they were more than happy to hold it for us. We're so glad they did!\n\nService was prompt and great. We ordered three appetizers and all was just fantastic. Wings were thoroughly seasoned and the sauce to accompany was sweet and delicious. The sprouts (which I feel are served at every millennial-friendly restaurant these days) were perfect. The oysters were great and served wirh two mignonettes (garlic and pomegranate) and they went down easy.\n\nGet the spicy tuna avocado bomb. It's exactly what you expect and despite my deftness with chopsticks, I recommend getting at it with a fork and knife. Sashimi was fresh and cut thick to get our money's worth. The dragon roll used real crab which was a nice touch. Drink selection was great with an impressive wine list (much like sister restaurant two urban licks).\n\nThis restaurant is styled in a very industrial manner without feeling cold. Love a big, open kitchen and the whole place smells like good food being prepared. Love paying my check by phone especially when pricing is fair. No doubt this is a pricier spot but I feel like we got a lot for the money.\n\nThis place is a winner - 5/5 we'll be back.",

The Brussel sprouts were to die for. The right amount of crispy and tasty. Not super sweet so if you like sweet Brussel sprouts don't get this. These were more Smokey/bitter but in a good way. The servers were attentive and the food came out fast. Loved this! Also great location on the belt line.",

The ambiance is nice, tables nicely positioned. I enjoyed the space between tables, it wasn't overly crowded.\n\nOur service was great. The waiter, I believe his name was Bee, was very knowledgeable of the menu. We tried many things, and loved them all. However, the rock shrimp did not stand out like the others. My absolute favorites were the brussel sprouts and both sushi rolls!\n\nOverall, great experience! I would recommend this place for small groups and dates. I would also return. I am interested to experience the menu changes, as I noticed a few photos from previous reviews were not on the menu anymore.",

On recommendation of our awesome server, after getting unfiltered (cold) sake which was refreshing but different, we got the duck spring rolls to start. These were perfectly crispy, a great size to share, and had a sweet and savory taste, 9/10. The spicy yellowtail roll with scallops and garlic aioli was amazing.. so clean tasting and flavorful with a little kick, 9/10. We finally got the rainbow roll, which was tasty as well, but pretty much a standard rainbow roll, 7/10. Our server was perfectly attentive and helpful in suggesting great items. The vibes were great, and it was beautiful inside with potted trees and hanging lights! Pro tip- there is free street parking nearby if you can snag it!",

        "text": "This place is hit and miss. We had numerous issues with our food orders. Some items came out timely and were really good (Crispy Brussels, Fried Shrimp apps and sushi). But other items came out super late (chicken skewers app), not at all, lacked flavor and any seasoning (grilled mitake) or were inedibly salty (salmon entree).\n\nTo top things off, service was poor. Or server rarely checked up on us and told us lies about why we were waiting so long for food items. At first she told us that the chicken skewers app took a long time to prepare, that's why we were still waiting for it 30 mins into our evening. Later, when we inquired again, she stated that the first one was burnt and had to be recooked. An hour later, after entrees were served they magically appeared.\n\nAt the end of service, our server inquired how was everything despite all the food mishaps. I mentioned that her service was subpar. As empty dishes and glassed piled up and cluttered the table she never offered to remove them. I had to suggest she take them away so we'd have room for the next items. She was also very unattentive. We literally had to yell to get her attention so we could get service throughout the night. She did apologize and stated that this was not her best night and that she was dealing with some personal issues but that was not an excuse. She also suggested we come on a Wednesday or Sunday, we could get better service on those, days, I found that statement quite comical. Overall, I appreciate her owning up to her shortcomings and hope she grows from this experience.\n\nWe will not be returning.",

        "text": "I wish I could give this 10 stars. It's that good.\n\nNestled in a small spot just off the Beltline, Bully Boy is hidden in the Two Urban Licks parking lot, yet when you enter it's almost like a greenhouse oasis, low lights, large tables, and a glowing 'oysters' sign. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing it is a foodies dream with everything from sushi to duck spring rolls to Miso Black Cod and even a market priced A-5 wagyu dish. On top of that, they have several different sake to choose from as well as great cocktails, a large wine list, and more. Let's find out more.\n\nStarting with the sake and cocktails, we opted to try two different Sakes, the Koji Sake - Junmani Daiginjo ATL Edition that was our favorite, it is crisp and smooth cold sake and very sippable with any of the dishes. The other one was a rose, pink sake called Mukai Shuzo - Ine Mankai, which was still very good, floral, and fruitier than the other. For our cocktail the staff recommended the Gin #5 cocktail and we couldn't have been happier. It is a floral gin that starts out tangy and then a smooth fruity end with cherry liquor and orange flower water and vermouth. It had a great balance. \n\nFor our shared plates, we tried a little bit of everything from crispy brussels sprouts to beef Negimaki, as well as Duck Spring Rolls, and their amazing King Kong Roll. Starting with the crispy brussels sprouts these were delicious with a sweetness and earthiness up front and then ended with a crunch and savory of the sauce. We'd never tried Negimaki before so we took a chance on it and we are glad we did! The wagyu beef was tender and meaty with a good rich flavor it surrounded crunchy and tangy cooked scallions that rounded out the bite with tang and crunch. \n\nSomething you have to try when you go to Bully Boy is their sushi! One of the rolls we tried was the King Kong Roll.  Cool and tender salmon and yellowtail, sweet and spicy tuna, creamy avocado, a fantastic roll to pair with a crisp sake! The flavor was so good, no wasabi was even needed! Finally, the Duck Spring Rolls were a great twist on a classic. Crunchy and flaky outside, tender pulled duck inside that had rich flavor and the typical cabbage and carrots, but they added peppers as well for more tang. Yum. \n\n On to our next course we pulled out all the stops and went for the pricey A-5 Wagyu and the Miso Black Cod! As for the beautiful and well-presented A-5 Wagyu it arrived in a smoke dome! It's like meat butter surrounded by a smoky, charred skin and topped with gold flakes. It goes perfectly with the tender marinated mushroom assortment. But we must admit that the Miso Black Cod stole the show! HOLY GOD, this must try dish is sweet and tender cod paired with a rich miso sauce and pickled vegetables on the side. Put the fish, miso sauce and veggies together for an incredible sweet, earthy, rich, tangy bite. We cannot recommend any more highly!\n\nWe enjoyed the King Kong Roll so much, we also got the Ping Pong Roll. Wait, those rhyme! This is a must try with cool and tangy pineapple atop a spicy tuna roll with a balsamic glaze. It starts out with the sweet, cool pineapple and then the spiciness of the tuna and the richness of the balsamic glaze hits you on the back. Delicious! After all of that, they do offer a mochi dessert. It's three seasonal flavors, ours turned out to be mango, matcha, and strawberry. If you are not familiar with mochi, they are chewy and fruity outside with ice cream inside and these are accompanied with fruit. We liked them all but we found you can mix and match them for best bite. I personally liked the matcha and strawberry together, almost like chocolate strawberry ice cream. \n\nOne of the best meals all year!! BRAVO!",

        "text": "Friday night bites This spot has been on my radar for a minute. But I actually ended up here by default. Not at all disappointed though and it's got a very cool, sexy but not sexual vibe, great service and tasty bites. What more could you ask for in a dining experience...\n(Side note it was a little bit complicated finding the front door. Almost gave it a prohibition-speakeasy feel but once you're in... you're in!)\n- Grilled octopus - flavorful but the texture threw me off -.5\n- Crispy Brussels - YO, if I could've licked the plate with nobody seeing me- \n-Duck spring rolls - great balance of flavors - \n- Curry Katsu Udon - deliciously savory especially on a chilly night-    \n- Seared scallops- perfectly cooked with a very nice zest to the risotto -.5\n- gnocci ice cream (vanilla/chocolate/mango) dough covered ice cream. Very interesting and tasty dessert concept - \nAmbiance - (note: look under the door handle for the bathroom door lock) \nService-  (Chris was awesome. Attentive, funny, helpful, not overbearing)\nPresentation-  (every looked like something I couldn't wait to put in my mouth) \nTaste-  - The contrast and balance of textures and flavors (some common and some unique) was expertly delivered.",

        "text": "This, with no exaggeration, may have been the best meal I've ever had. I was invited as a plus one to an influencer event, and I cannot think of a single negative thing to say.\n\nWe were served 13 courses of all the top selections, with additional beverages, an aperitif, and dessert. Notable highlights for me included the Brussels sprouts, the volcano roll, the duck paella, and the miso black cod. The flavor palate of each dish was so unique and exciting, the preparation was stunning, and if I'd had more room in my stomach I would have happily eaten there all night. \n\nThe service was incredible, the staff was so kind and attentive, and the ambiance of the space was flawless. The only slight I have is that the entrance was challenging to find, but in finding it, it gave the restaurant an almost speakeasy vibe. \n\nThe price point was high, but in my opinion it's worth every penny. I would genuinely rate this as one of the best restaurants in Atlanta. Will absolutely be coming back!",

Now I've had my fair share of Tuna Tatakis in my life and this one was the best I've ever had.  So much flavor!  We loved it so much we ordered a second one.  \n\nWe also had the tempura rock shrimp which was delicious followed by the yellowtail jalapeño which was great as well.  \n\nThe drinks were great as well!\n\nThe service was perfect.  Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  \n\nThe atmosphere was really cool.  You feel like you're in a greenhouse and I'm a plant person so I love the huge trees inside.  \n\nI will definitely be back.",

        "text": "I was really excited to go here, unfortunately I was very underwhelmed. The service was not up to par. I felt uncomfortable asking for anything. When I saw miso cod on the menu I was so excited. The cod was undercooked and looked completely different than another person at my tables cod. The cod was also very fishy compared to other cods I have had. I give it 2 stars for the sushi rolls they were great, but it took about 20 minutes longer to get the sushi than the entrees. The Brussels sprouts were the star of the night. The oysters were disappointing as well. The sauce with the oysters did not compliment the oysters. Drinks were very unimpressive, ordered a lychee martini tasted like elderflower. I added pictures to compare the cods.",

At nighttime it has a romantic dim light setting. Perfect for pictures. Also worth noting that there is a lot of greenery/plants. Again, perfect for pictures! \n\nWe tried the Braised beef, oysters, Miso Black Cod, Godzilla Roll, and a delicious dessert. \n\nThe oysters came out within 10 minutes. I can't remember the names, but we got both types on the menu and they were good. \n\nThe braised beef was delicious. The meat was succulent- tender. The cod was so soft, loved the flavors of the veggies. \n\nI didn't try the sushi but my data said he loved it.",

Shout out to our server Beau (or Bo lol) as he was truly the best server! He was very attentive and was super friendly and made us feel welcome since this was our first time dining here. \n\nI guess when my husband made reservations, he notated that we're here celebrating my birthday and our server brought us 2 glasses of champagne, YAY! Our server also explained that everything on their menu is meant to be shared. We got 5 dishes - crispy Brussels, grilled mitake, spirited away roll, rainbow roll and miso cod. Everything was so good and on point. The crispy Brussels were fried to perfection and had a crispy exterior, plus loved the addition of green onions for an extra depth of flavor. The grilled mitake could be grilled more but loved the grana padana. The spirited away roll was divine - I loved the topped seared tuna (and it's a pretty hefty serving of seared tuna too). The rainbow roll was also pretty good with different fish toppings. Lastly, the miso cod was fork tender and tasty but best eaten with the side of pickled veggies it's served with. \n\nHonestly, I was super impressed with everything about this place. We hope to dine here again soon!",

        "text": "FOOD ORDERED: \nDuck Spring Rolls \nHalf order of Blue Point Oysters \nBraised Beef \nTiger Roll \nSpider Roll \nKing Kong Roll \nMochi Ice Cream \nDRINKS ORDERED: \nOrion \nTequila \n\nWe started off with the duck spring rolls and oysters as appetizers. The spring rolls were packed with tons of flavor and the Thai chili sauce only added to it! The spring rolls were crispy and beautifully assembled. \nMy boyfriend devoured the oysters pretty quickly as they were wonderfully prepared and came with a tasty cranberry sauce to add onto them. \nNext up we ordered the braised beef. The smoked paprika mashed potatoes and glaze were wonderful. The meat was tender and cooked exactly the way we had hoped it would be. \nWe ordered three different rolls. The Spider, the Tiger, and the King Kong. They were beautifully plated, fresh tasting, and larger than we had anticipated. \nFor dessert we ordered the mocha ice cream in three flavors. We got chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Mochi has been one of my favorites since I was a child, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Our favorite of the three was the strawberry!\nOur drinks were great. I loved the passion fruit in the tequila. It was sweet and refreshing. \n\nThe vibe inside was perfect for date night. Definitely a place for friends to get together and enjoy some really great food. It reminded us of a restaurant in Japan and one in Tulum. Kind of a mixture of the two with the woody feel and decor inside. Our waitress was phenomenal and and we can't wait to come back for round two!",

I would recommend the sushi is rolled tighter or spray the plate so the roll doesn't stick. Half of the rolls fell apart due to extreme stickiness with the plate and rice. The mimosas were a half glass full for $10. This is overpriced even for the area. Overall, we will be back.",

        "text": "Bully Boy reopened in the Fall of 2021, with a new chef and a new, smaller menu. Gone are the crab rolls, duck bao, oyster sliders, blue crab fried rice, and lobster frites that we loved, but elements of Old Bully Boy are still there -- Oysters, Bibb lettuce, crispy Brussels, and overall still a seafood heavy menu, with Japanese and other Asian cuisine influences.\n\nI went on a Saturday night, an hour after opening, and much to my surprise I had the place to myself -- I'm guessing people don't know they're back open. Also, It's Kaiseki style which is good for groups and sharing. \n\nI tried the following:\nDuck spring rolls - A must order!!\nSmoked Hamachi - The smoked flavor, whipped feta and gooseberry confit make this unlike any hamachi you've had!\nWagyu Tobanyaki - Great choice with seasonal mushrooms, and Summer Squash. \nYuzu Brûlée with wasabi whipped cream- (Sounds insane but 10/10)\nRum #1 - Delicious (Dragon Fruit Infused Rum, Umeshu Plum Wine, Lime, Maraschino, Palm simple)\nSoju #2 - Not my favorite, but is a nice hint of fall! I'd pair it with dessert  (Apple Soju, Baked Apple, Cardamaro & Dram Rinse)\n\nI really enjoyed the food, signature cocktails, and overall my dining experience. Eventually other patrons entered, but still a very quiet crowd! By the looks of things, chef Colby switches out elements of the menu regularly including the drink and dessert menu so look before you go.",

The lemon sushi roll had shrimp tempura that added texture, it was really a journey of flavors that felt like a scene in Ratatouille. The service was good.

Grilled Octopus and Grilled Mitake were absolutely delish.  This is our second time. We came in January 2020 a month before Covid shut down everything.  I remember before the duck bao, crab rolls, blue crab fried rice, lobster fries.  Those were stunning and absolutely memorable dishes and we were expecting to see those. We specifically came here to celebrate a bday like the first time we came and was blown away by that menu. What a shame they pared down the menu now.  Would love to see those items back on the menu. \n \n\n\n***COST (OUT OF 4$) $$$ Tapas portion plates so little plates add up. \n\n\n\n***DÉCOR: limited amount of tables, dark moody wood, hipster vibe\n\n\n\n***SERVICE: Good service, attentive, not intrusive, food came quick \n\n\n\n***RECOMMEND: HIGHLY RECOMMEND and would definitely go again.\n\n\n\n***MEAL: oysters - fresh West Coast & East Coast, Crispy Brussel Sprouts - good, Yakitori- good, Duck Spring Roll - good, Grilled Octopus- very good, Miso Cod-MUST HAVE so delicate, so smooth like butter, Grill Mitake- Very very good, Ma Po Tofu - delish, Coffee Brulee- yummy, Mochi-Double yummy dessert",

Chicken yakitori was very tender but fried snapper thai style was little overcooked but liked the crispy skin and a lot of vegetables, the sauce could have been more spicy.. the bottle of the sake was too sweet for my taste, we finished off with coffee brulee.

        "text": "Let me start by saying, my husband and I were celebrating our one month wedding anniversary and we narrowed our choices of place to celebrate to Bully Boy or 2 Urban Licks and since we already ate at 2 urban licks, we decided to try Bully Boy. \nThe food which is an asian/sushi cuisine was very tasty and the waitress Rieleigh was nice enough. Our issue came in when it was time to  pay. Our bill came to $220.98 and my husband provided his Amex card to pay. The waitress came back and told us that our card was declined. We looked at each other and said no way. Try again. She did once more with the same result. We gave her 3 more cards to try all with the same results. We of course called our financial institutions and requested info and was told no transactions have come through. The waitress went to find her manager. The manager went across to 2 urban licks (they are owned by the same company) and he found out that they were also having a problem with the computer payment system. My husband asked him what can they do to rectify and solve this issue. This manager,  B. Abdullah proceeded to say that he did not like his tone and demanded that we pay cash. He wanted to hold us hostage until we gave him cash for the bill or he would call the police. We stated that that was crazy. If your computer system is down, how are we to blame for that? So we called the police. \nThe off duty officer from 2 urban licks came over to help sort the situation out, to No avail because what are you going to do if the system is down. \nInstead of this manager being humble and apologetic, we got an arrogant attitude from a man who didn't listen to reason. Why risk the reputation of your restaurant on trying to prove a faulty point. YOU ARE WRONG ! Instead of you trying to work out an amicable solution for your inadequate technology, you will fight and argue with a customer? \nThis man had absolutely no common sense or customer service skills at all. We will never return to either one of these restaurants for the unreasonableness of this one person and I will always steer anyone else I know away from this place. \nThe night came to an end with my husband making the suggestion to write down the card info and run it in the morning when your computer system comes back up, which would have been a reasonable thing for a person in management to suggest from the start, along with a discount for the inconvenience. All ill feelings could have been avoided. \nBut he ruined our 1 month anniversary dinner with his arrogance and inability to be flexible. \nSome things do come down to principal..... \n\nSide note, while talking with the waitress she shared the fact that there was another customer whose card did not go through as well and when she walked away to get help, they walked out and ditched the bill. We could have done the same, but we tried to work out a solution to there problem. Since this issue had nothing to do with her abilities as a waitress we paid her tip in cash. This was not her fault, she was pleasant and did her job. \n\nThis manager guy also told us they were losing money every month, so maybe thats why he was upset.... But taking your frustrations out on customers is never acceptable! \n\nI added a picture of the manager for all to see. This guy has absolutely no customer service skills. Buyer beware!",

It looked a bit like the restaurant in The Menu so I wasn't sure if that was good or bad but it was amusing so that's a plus. Menu looked interesting, if a bit pricey but whatever. We're out! It's a Saturday night! Yay!\n\nSo we ordered our food. \n\nAnd we waited. \n\nAnd waited. \n\nThe food did come out but soooo slooooow. We ordered 8 dishes (2 appetizers and 6 sushi rolls) and after two hours, only 6 total things had come. We were there late so the restaurant was getting less and less crowded but the food took longer and longer. \n\nAnd the food itself was... mediocre. The sushi rice had no flavor but somehow the taste of the primary ingredient was still lost. And one of our appetizers would have been far superior as a side.  I had a cocktail that was good but beyond that? Everything was ok at best. \n\nAnyway, it was clear that the wait was an anomaly because they tried to make it up to us by offering a glass of champagne but... yeah, no. Very disappointing.",

        "text": "TREE NUT & GLUTEN ALLERGIES - BEWARE \n\nWent to this restaurant for the first time a few weeks ago, our group warned them before hand of several severe allergies, and they were super careless about them. After one of our friends disclosed she was deathly allergic to tree nuts, our oysters had pink peppercorns (cashew family) everywhere; when we followed up with the waitress, she was curt and rude when we called her out and asked her why our food still had the specified allergen on it. I don't think they would have given a shit if any one of us ended up in the hospital because of a lack of effort on their part. It was like we were out of line for acknowledging that they had basically ignored us telling them about the allergies we had at the table. \n\nOur other friend at the table had celiac, and they had no clue what was or wasn't gluten free. They told her she couldn't have the rice and that they couldn't do the rolls gluten free, but then brought her out said normal rolls (which she refused), then brought her out a randomly gluten free (?) roll... then tried to charge her for a bunch of food she never got. There was also super delayed/forgotten orders, and we sat down while the restaurant was pretty dead. People who sat down after us were getting their food quicker. \n\nOverall, a careless establishment with bad service. We thought they were a new restaurant so we tried giving them the benefit of the doubt, but after finding out the place had opened in 2018 and was associated with TWO urban licks, we were appalled. On top of all of this, the server went ahead and tacked an automatic gratuity on the bill... almost as if they knew they'd be missing tips for terrible service (and almost annihilating one of our friends - she would have ended up in the ER with severe symptoms). \n\nThe food was fine but not worth the god awful experience. Save your time and money and dine at MF Sushi or Tomo for the same price, or choose an establishment that takes food allergies and its customers seriously and provides better service.",

        "text": "THEEEEEE best restaurant that I've dined at in Atlanta in a loooooooong time!!! \nIt's got every element one could hope for when venturing out for a fun dinning experience! \nFirst of all the food was artistically well rounded. It was creative, delicious, and full of color! \nSecondly the service was outstanding! \nAnd thirdly, the ambience was aesthetically pleasing. I felt like I was back in Miami at one of their posh restaurants. The decor is simple and earthy. Tons of green plants throughout the room, complemented with black, brown and gold colors. \nDishes you must try: \nsmoked hamachi\nBrussels sprouts \nOysters(great whites, Massachusetts)\nFlounder crude \nCocktails: \nSpicy tequila- ( don't remember the name)\n\n\nThe only thing I was disappointed by was the wagyu dish. The mushrooms and vegetables were delicious however the meat really didn't taste like much of anything. \n\nOverall it was a fantastic dining experience and I so so so recommend it to anyone looking for a new great place to dine in at the Atlanta area!!!",

Thai style fish had strange vegetable salad side - felt like there were three separate items, the fish, the sauce and the salad. Each was good but didn't relate. Oysters were oddly not good. They 'lost' a couple of our orders and we had to ask about them. Brussels sprouts were similar to other trendy restaurants. Maitaki (mushroom) was a cool idea but over-charred. Chinese broccoli was uninspired. Our server was nice but the price tag didn't make sense.",

It was the perfect amount for two people and so tasty. There were only two types of oysters, neither really did it for me. Crispy brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had! Sooo delicious. Miso cod was pretty good as well.  I'm not really into sushi, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it the spicy yellowtail roll.",

We ordered the wings which were good--nothing memorable. And we had the lobster frites which was our goals after seeing some other yelp photos. It was amazing --- barere der recommend we dip the truffle fries into the lobster sauce they use and that was a solid deal!! \n\nYou wanna choose your drink by deciding what  alcohol base you are feeling --I was doing an easy vodka selection but the bartender said that drink was super safe and I'd prob like the tequila one better --and I did. So good!! \n\nWill be back to try again. This time will make a ressie so we don't have to sit at the bar. It looked empty at 730 on a Friday but they said the reservations are all full \n\n\nUpdate visit 2. Made rsvp Sat in back area. Started with oysters....all a bit small and I special but perhaps we are too used to the Optimist and Beetlecat selections. Had pretty attentive service and quickly ordered a squid ink dish and a small beef dish. Both were delightful and full of flavor as paired with some champagne were a good start to the evening.
