Their cocktails are really good. \n\nThe service overall is fine, sometimes it's hard to find the waiter but they make their way around. The ambiance is very nice but the music can be a little loud.\n\nI'll return and stick to my favorite meats.",

There was plenty of seating available including long tables and big booths, ideal for large parties. \n\nThe initial spread is a bowl of salad with a spicy dressing, two types of pickled daikon, four types of dipping sauces and bowls of rice. Dipping options were sesame oil with salt and pepper, \"yum yum,\" soy/teriyaki, and spicy garlic sauce. For meats we tried their pork belly, Hawaiian bulgogi, brisket, and lemon chicken. My favorite type of meat was the bulgogi but I think we did over cook the pork belly. Chicken didn't have a strong lemon taste but was tender. Sides included japchae, spice rice cakes, kimchi, steamed eggs, and vegetables. Japchae was served cold but tasted okay. Rice cakes had a slight crispy layer with good taste but were not authentic, too sweet. Kimchi wasn't bad but the steamed eggs were hard to gage when it was done.\n\nOverall, we had a good experience given the meat selection and price. Staff were spread thin resulting in delays before they returned. Grills are changed in between depending on what was being prepared. Although not authentic Korean BBQ, it was still tasty enough for me to come again!",

The service was excellent, and the food is delivered to your table for you to cook the way you like it. \n\nWe had the spicy bulgogi which was very tasty (not really spicy) and we had the regular bulgogi which was packed full of flavor, and then we had the lemon chicken (couldn't really taste the lemon), but all of the proteins were tender and great tasting.

We went on a Saturday night with 6 people (they don't take reservations btw) and waited an hour for a table.  We got there at 7:30 and my advice is if you don't want to wait too long go at about 8:00.  By that time the smaller tables were beginning to turn, probably for the second time - it is AYCE with a two hour time limit.  The soy marinated steak, spicy pork and beef bulgogi were our favorites.  The salad on the table is great, japchae (seasoned glass noodles), seasoned rice cakes and kimchi are all DELICIOUS but the noise was WAY WAY too much for me.  Along with those other meats we had squid, shrimp, chicken, seasoned steak and an unseasoned steak as well.  I really liked the squid a lot and it cooks super quickly if you're in need of food NOW.  The shrimp is served head and shell on so remember that if you order it.  You can either peel it before you grill it or deal with that when it is hot.  Optionally you can choose what I did and eat the shell (it's pretty thin).  On our way out we saw some guys who had a garlic/oil/ butter sauce boiling away on their grill and next time I'm going to ask for that, but I'll go back when it isn't so loud and crowded. $30/each with AYCE meats and banchan.  I can't tell you about their drinks (aside from the fact that their martinis are very small) because I was the designated driver and just had water.  The water was great tho, no musty smell or aftertaste.  All in all a great value, tasty and a lot of fun if you can get past the din.  Oh, and btw, they have GREAT ventilation for the grills so you do not end up smelling like KBBQ!",

When ordering our first set of meat, I also requested some rice and a plate of the japchae (Korean glass noodles). When the noodles came out, they looked different from before but I still gave them a try. I found they were very bland and not nearly as good as they were before. When I asked our server, she let me know the recipe had been changed recently. I really hope they change the recipe back. \nBut anyways - the ambiance is always lively and fun. \nPricing has been consistent - AYCE is $28 for the basic menu. I do wish they would include soft drinks in the price but that's just me. \nI'm really glad that locations closer than Duluth have opened in Toco Hills.",

Given all the heat from the stoves they keep the air turned up. They also project k-pop videos on the walls. I was never really a fan until I came here.

Since the line and wait is usually long, especially on the weekend. \n\nMy family came in on a Friday night around 9PM. We were told the wait was 30 mins but ended up waiting about 5 mins. \n\nThey were very generous with their sides! Our server was very attentive. The japchae was sooo good! We had 3 rounds of it. It's the best I've had, who ever made it Friday night needs a raise. All the meats were fresh, we had 2 rounds of brisket, soy pork and pork belly.",

The waiter is as involved as you want them to be, we told them we could handle it and the grill caught on fire shortly after. It seems if you want them to cook then they stay at your table for most of the experience. Thankfully he was attentive and replaced it quickly and lowered the heat so we could continue our dining experience. The chicken wasn't my favorite but I don't usually order that at KBBQ. The bulgogi beef and the Hawaiian one was very good, the grilled pineapples were a perfect contrast to the richness of the meat. The banchan was varied and very fresh, I will definitely return if in the area.",

You can only order two meats at a time, but this worked out for us because we definitely underestimated how filling it would be. The staff was also very helpful and would come check on us every few minutes to ensure the meat was cooking properly. The music was a bit too loud to the point where we couldn't hear each other at the same table but the vibe was nice. Definitely come on an empty stomach.",

We had a party of 3 so we sat within 5 minutes of getting there. They have a set AYCE ( all you can eat ) menu . The drink menu like most restaurants now are located on the QR code. The menu they provide is disposable. \n\nYou essentially pick your own meats and at that point they bring them to the table 2 at a time. They'll come by and turn your meats for you. If you let them know they'll leave you alone lol. Our server turned our pork two quickly for our liking so i just flipped it back and let her know our preferred cooking methods. ***culture thing ( turning the food too much will spoil the meat)\n\nI had a Mai Tai -- drink was 6 for bottom shelf its an additional 3 for top shelf. \nThe drink was very sweet -- you couldn't taste the alcohol -- which for some is fine. I  personally don't like my drinks to taste like more syrup, id atleast like to taste the twang behind it . It wasn't a sneak up kind of drink either.\n\nThis isn't my first Korean bbq so I can't go too much into detail about the experience. If you've never been i think its something different to try as a date night \n\nThe 4 sauces they provide are really good. they have small side dishes if you will that you can request ore of and it also comes with white rice. The small side dishes do have a chili sauce on it so it has a  bite to it. \n\nI've been here multiple times before -- never thought to review it.",

                "text": "I came here for ayce kbbq with my friends. We didn't want to drive to Deluth since it's a bit too far from their house.\n\nThere weren't many side dishes and they were all kind of blah in my opinion. Their japchae was sad....super broken glass noodles that were very cold (like it came straight from the fridge) and barely any veggies and didn't have much flavor. The kimchi was pretty good though.\n\nThey have 2 types of grill plates for certain meats. The waiter stated that we could order all of the meats together except the bulgogi. So we ordered brisket, pork belly, shrimp, veggies, steamed egg for the first round. The steamed egg was super watery to me. When we were ready to order bulgogi, he switched the grill plate out. The meats were pretty good. I thought it was kind of weird that our waiter threw the whole plate of brisket on the grill instead of just letting us do it ourselves. I prefer to cook as I eat so it's hot. But we had to cook all of the meat and once it was cooked, we had to move it onto a plate so it wouldn't burn since we couldn't eat it that fast between 3 people. The spicy squid was good but not spicy at all. The veggies that came out were onions, bell peppers, butternut squash and cut into large pieces. I wish they had mushrooms on the menu.\n\nI'm not sure if this is the type of place where they're supposed to cook for you or not. Our server did offer to cut the meat for us, but he seemed busy so I said he didn't have to. Plus, I've been to several kbbq places before so I didn't really need any help. Our server was a bit slow with coming to check on our table for us to order more food or refill out waters.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a cute little shopping center so there is plenty of parking.",

The pickled fruit and veggies are my fav. The dressing is nice \nThey also have a full bar. \nNo super cheap about $30 a person for adults and $14 for children under 7 I believe so budget accordingly.",

This was my first time trying Korean BBQ and definitely enjoyed myself. \n\nThere was a bit of a wait, about and hour to get a table, and they only take reservations for large groups. But we went to another restaurant not too far and grabbed drinks at the bar while waiting. \n\nOnce we were seated, my date recommended the Hawaii Bulgogi and I think Lemon Chicken both which were very good. I ordered the Beef Brisket which was just ok. The sides were good of course we had rice, I ordered the Japchae and Kimchi and was full by the second meat lol. \n\nThe food was good, the restaurant itself was cool, they played K-pop videos all night. It's a little loud, dimly lit and definitely a causal vibe. \n\nI would definitely go back again.",

I've never found any other place that makes rice cakes like they do, and I'm obsessed. The servers are very nice and helpful if you've never done Korean bbq before, but I'd recommend going with someone who do knows what they're doing because it is cool it yourself. It gets pretty loud inside so if you want to be able to hear who you're with really well, either sit on the same side or go during lunch when it's less busy. They don't take reservations though so if you're going on a weekend good luck.",

The beef brisket and pork belly had A LOT of fat. \n- Japchae was disappointing. The noodles were hard like it was just taken out of the refrigerator and/or not fully cooked. \n- The steamed egg (which is one of my favorite items to order) were served raw in aluminum bowls that you have to cook on the grill. Not only does the cooking process take long, it takes up grill space for meat. \n- Service could be better. DJ, our server, at one point reached over me while I was mid-conversation to refill my sauces. His phone also went off very loudly when he was at our table, which he tried to answer until we looked over and he apologized and walked away. \n\nI wasn't expecting a 5-star experience. We knew better. But we came thinking it was only $18pp...only to find out the prices went up and the diminishing quality. The experience was very disappointing. \n\nTDLR; Drive a bit further north to Duluth for a number of KBBQ options far better than this.",

There is a 2 hour dining limit and you cannot take leftovers home. \nThis was our first Korean steak house experience & it did not disappoint. We surpassed our money's worth with the all you can eat menu. Come hungry!\nTogether we tried 6 proteins: seasoned steak, soy steak, another plain steak, pork belly, lemon chicken, and pork bulgogi. \nMy least favorite was the lemon chicken. The meat was sweet versus the citrusy accents I was expecting... it was also pretty fatty, but that tracks for thigh meat. My fianc\u00e9's least favorite was the pork belly, which he shared was bland. \nNo one comes to a steakhouse for the rice, BUT it was the best I ever had. \nNote: wear layers.

As well as what was good for the baby. \n\nWe made it 2 rounds and we were all so full. $29 for dinner and we ordered margaritas that were FIRE and so yummy. I'd definitely come back again.

It is all you can eat with meat, seafood and sides for $29 a person for dinner, lunch is a different price but I forgot what it was. \n\nYou are able to choose what kind of meat you would like, they bring it to the table and it is cooked right in front of you are able to cook it and they have 4 delicious sauces you can dip the meat in if you so choose. It is a fun experience, the meat & seafood was delicious, I wouldn't get the shrimp again because you have to peel the shell off after it is finished cooking and that was too much work for me personally. \n\nOverall it was very clean, parking is free and it was a great experience.",

At first I thought I would be confused on how to eat all this right but our waiter explained us the way things work and got us very excited for a good time we were about to have. The food was so delicious, I don't know what kinda magic they put in their meat but it was so good, filling, flavourful. We had so much fun playing \"grill masters\" . They give you a variety of sides, those were amazing too, especially the salad omg that dressing they had in it was divine. The sauces for your meat are grrreat too. Overall I had a great time and can't wait to go again and bring everybody I know lol please welcome a new Korean bbq addict",

                "text": "4 stars for a fun new Korean steakhouse spot.\n\nAs an Emory alum, it was a little strange seeing a Korean steakhouse in the former space where Famous bar was located. However, as I was looking around the Toco Hills plaza for food a few weeks after getting my second COVID vaccine, I thought it would check the place out and see if the venue could create some new fun memories.\n\nI went inside and saw quite the spectacle. The venue is somewhat dimly lit (kind of like Famous was) with music videos being projected up on the walls and fairly loud music. The host took me over to one of the tables and told me that the setup is pretty simple: for $27, I could eat as much meat as I could handle. It kind of reminded me of a Fogo de Chao mixed with a Korean BBQ spot, so I said ok and started chowing on the moderately spicy salad waiting for me at the table.\n\nMy waitress came over soon after to take my first meat order. She was extremely friendly and, although she was pretty busy with lots of tables, she did a pretty good job coming back to help cook the various meats I ordered. I asked for her recommendations and the 2 she gave (bulgogi and iron age steak) were the best meats I had the entire night. \n\nThose 2 meats were actually the first 2 that she brought out and started cooking. I'll admit that waiting for the first meat to get cooked does take a little while and creates a bit of a lull (might make sense to have the waitress bring out salads with the meats rather than have them already at the table for timing purposes), but my Hawaiian bulgogi was done soon enough and tasted quite good. My Iron Age steak was also solid and went really well with one of the little purple wraps on the table (can't quite remember what they were called). \n\nI then moved on to some shrimp and pork belly. The shrimp looks pretty odd when it is first brought out and put on the grill and is a little difficult to deshell and eat, so I wouldn't recommend that option unless you really want shrimp. The pork belly was alright (I was pretty full at that point), but I think that meat benefits more from a chef's care and might work better as a starter drenched with the dipping sauces if you are gonna go that route.\n\nOverall, Iron Age in Toco Hill's provided me with a pretty funky Korean steak experience. The scene isn't for everyone (does that make me sound old?), but the great service and food makes this place worth checking out if you are looking to try something different.",

Please also know they tell you the shrimp is whole and that includes the head is still on it. If having the head on your shrimp is a concern, don't get it.",

                "text": "We came here at 5 pm on a Friday in late October for dinner and had an overall good experience.  We've been to Iron Age in Sandy Springs many times, so we knew what to expect food wise.\n\nThis Iron Age is in Toco Hills, a sprawling outdoor shopping area with a huge free parking lot in the middle.  Finding parking should not be an issue here.\n\nWe walked in and were immediately welcomed.  However, we had to wait about 25 minutes before we were seated.  The reason for our delay was not explained, and I was confused why anyone had to wait since there was a whole section of empty booths (probably about 9 booths).\n\nAfter being seated in a comfy booth by the hostess, our server came by and asked us if this was our first time.  We told her that we've eaten at Iron Age before, just not this location.  She fired up the grill in the middle of the table and asked if we needed menus.  We told her menus weren't necessary and then started ordering:  Rice cakes, kimchi, japchae, radishes, green salad, white steamed rice, Iron Age steak, Seasoned steak and regular bulgogi.  Glasses of water was brought to us first.  We got our sides about 2 minutes later, followed by the raw meats about 5 minutes after the sides.  Our server put the meats on the grill for us.  I took over the cooking duties for the rest of the meal, cooking the beef to a medium rare doneness.  The three meats were perfectly seasoned/marinated.  My all time favorite meat at Iron Age is the Iron Age Steak, with the seasoned steak a close second.  The sides were good.  R cooked the rice cakes, and that added a grilled flavor to them.\n\nWe decided to try the pork belly.  I was expecting the pork belly to taste like bacon.  Nope!  It was bland because it wasn't seasoned or marinated.  We won't get that again.  We also got some brisket with veggies.  The brisket was also bland because of no seasoning.  We were ready for more meats, but it was around this time during our meal that our server kept disappearing from the dining area.  We had to flag down another employee to get our server.  When she showed up again, we requested the meats that we enjoy, so we got another round of Iron Age steak and seasoned steak, and got a refill of all the sides except for the salad, which was brought to us in a big bowl at the beginning of our meal.  Because we're big carnivores, the price of the AYCE is worth it to us.  The quality of the meats were pretty consistent tonight, and they were all good quality.\n\nI think it's great that we walk out of Iron Age and not smell excessively like we just walked through a smokehouse.  The only smoke I saw from any of the tables was when a customer at a nearby table got their napkin too close to the grill and the paper just went up in flames and smoke.  8-| \n\nI like that this location has a lot of roomy booths.  They also have a bar that was unused while we were there.\n\nOverall a good experience.",

When we arrived at the table there were already water and place settings. The dinner price is 27 pp and very worth it. \n\nPros: the food was AMAZING. I loved everything I ate. Because we had such a big party, I didn't get a chance to choose what meats I was actually eating; I left that to the birthday girl and her family, but everything was great. Nice environment. The bathrooms were clean. And it was an overall great experience. I also didn't feel like I was being robbed of my 20% tip because our server was ON IT #Chef26 \n\nCons: my drinks were very watered down Hennessy margaritax2. They were $10each and they are the main reason for the 4stars. I also felt like we could've had more room at the table. We were cramped imo. They did try to accommodate the spacing issue closer to the end but everyone was done eating by that time.",

For our sides, we had the fried rice pieces and the rice (I add the Mayo sauce). You can get whatever sides you want, but you have to ask for it. I love this spot so much!

From the popularity, I thought that there was going to be a long line but ended up only spending a couple of minutes till had out seats.\n\nThe service was good, I live that it's AYCE. The price wasn't bad. It was $25 dollars each with no time limit. Compared to another restaurant that we had in Midtown the experience here was much better. This restaurant also has a cheaper price during lunchtime for only $18.\n\nWe ordered beef soup and rice cakes for our appetizers. I have to say that the steamed egg was really good especially when you put some white rice in soup.  As for the rice cake I think it's too hard and cold to eat, not the right way to be served. Just make sure don't eat too much of the appetizers since they can make you feel full too quickly.\n\nFor our meal, we ordered four items. Mainly just beef and pork. Their classic steak, pork belly, beef bulgogi and beef brisket. The portions that they gave us was very large and the quality wasn't bad. The taste was authentically South Korean. It was sweet and tender. To go along with our meats, they provided us four difference sauces to dip them in. For me, the yellow sauce was the best.\n\nFor the price, the quality and quantity were very good. As for the environment, I can't say that it was peaceful. The music was very loud. But it would be a great place to have a party. The restaurant had a lot of space for people to talk and eat together. Best of you come in a group. Makes the experience better!",
