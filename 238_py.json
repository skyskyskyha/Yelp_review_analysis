                "text": "I came here between 7:30-8:00pm with 3 friends after a long volleyball tournament day. There was no indoor seating available since they were accommodating a wedding party, but they were able to seat us outside within 15 minutes. \n\nAlthough we got seated quickly, it took ages to receive our food. We believe this might be to recovering from the wedding party as they left shortly after we were seated. One of my friends that has frequented this restaurant also stated that this was not the norm.\n\nNow here is what I ordered:\n\nRed wine Sangria: This had a nice balance so it was not overly sweet. I do wish that the pulp was strained as I'm not the biggest fan of it, and there was a lot.\n\nSmoked brisket egg rolls: These are a must-get!! The flavors from the smoked brisket was amazing and paired well with the sweet and sour dipping sauce. It also came with some pickled red onions!\n\nBBQ plate of smoked brisket with a side of Mac & cheese and Thai chili brussel sprouts: The smoked brisket comes either lean, fatty, or mixed. I ended up choosing the mixed, which was great! The downside was that it was cold, but the flavors still powered through. The BBQ sauce they brought out to the table enhanced it even more. The Mac & cheese was deliciously creamy and had a nice crust at the top. The Thai brussel sprouts was definitely my favorite out of the two sides. They were slightly crispy and that sauce sealed it!\n\nI recommend trying out this place if you enjoy some good ole BBQ/comfort food!",

For our main course we had the classic bbq plates. Choose 2 meats and 2 sides. Everything tasted so good and unique! We were told they have 2 smokers in the back and the owners come in and help in the kitchen several times a week! They have a couple tvs for your entertainment but plenty of seating for different sized groups. Street parking is available across the street! Thank you thank you sweet auburn bbq!",

Everything was quick and everyone was super nice! The table shared cornbread while I had the brisket platter as my entree with Mac n cheese and slaw. The brisket itself was just ok, but the Mac n cheese was the star of the show so I'd definitely come back just to get that!\n\nOverall, sweet auburn is fine if you're looking for a bbq spot in the city, but I do think fox bros down the road is a lot better!",

For appetizers we ordered CONFIT SWEET POTATOES 14\ncoconut lemongrass broth, sriracha honey, thai basil, chili crisp, smoked peanuts, cilantro ( personal fav) \nNAM JIM JAEW BRISKET TOSTADAS 15\nhouse smoked brisket, nam jim jaew, napa cabbage, pickled onion, thai basil, fried wonton shells. Also incredible! We especially loved the sweet potato confit with some coconut base( still dreaming of it) as well as the brussel sprouts but also my pulled pork bowl (Logan Turnpike stone-ground cheddar grits, house made pickles & pickled onions, scallions, & BBQ sauce bowl) was so insanely good! the grits were so creamy and the pork melted in my mouth! My mom got the sweet auburn taco plate and if was devoured too. I brought my uncle here whos from LA and is a foodie and he loved it and the prices are so great for such amazing quality food! \n\nThe server was also the sweetest and so knowledgeable about everything! Per usual had the best time and cant wait to come back!",

While they don't have much parking, you can park at the garage across the street and they will validate up to 2 hrs. Once you step inside you can smell how good the bbq taste. I didn't make a reservation (highly suggested), but we were able to sit at the bar. Had we not, the wait was about an hr. I ordered the cornbread as a shareable, and half a slab of ribs with fries as my entree. My son ordered their waygu burger and he said it was really good. The ribs were nice and tender and I'd defiantly recommend the jalape\u00f1o cornbread. This day I didn't order any ducks but I did see quite a few ppl with some nice looking ones. I plan to go back to try other options as well.",

There is limited parking around the building, but they do offer 2-hour parking at the parking deck across the street. \n\nWe were apart of a larger party of 7 with children, and they were kind enough to accommodate us. This was somewhat of a challenge as the space is not large.  Our server gave some suggestions on appetizers and entrees, so we gave our whole order up front to help keep things moving smooth. We started with the smoked wings which we delicious. We had a dozen, half the Wu Tang flavor and half spicy BBQ. The Wu Tang was my fave by far.  We also shared the brisket egg rolls which pretty good when you add the pickled onions and Thai chilli sauce to each bite.\n\nThe entrees then came out but our side were mixed up. It wasn't a big deal for me, but being that we had a table with kids and adults it made things a bit confusing once plates came to the table. I got the BBQ brisket which you can get chopped, lean, or Fatty. It had great smoke flavor, and seasoned well. I got the Mac and cheese which had a funky cheesy smell, but it was soooo good. I also got the thai chilli brussel sprouts which was amazing, and the fries.\n\nMy wife got the BBQ pork, which was pretty good and for sides she got the green beans which were ok, and the baked beans that were not good at all.\n\nOur server did a good job with making sure to keep up with our water service and was even kind enough to separate our bill. Large parties have gratuity added of course.  Definitely a place I would come back to.",

The mistake occurred because now I might possibly have found my true love and it's this food!  \n\nTrying to show off a bit of southern charm with a level of sophisticated class for folks from Canadian, California and New Jersey  was a tall order from the beginning!   Sweet Auburn did not disappoint!  \n\nThe atmosphere was just right!  The place was definitely hopping!  Love the decor right in the heart of a bustling neighborhood.  The service was fantastic.  Our server was not only helping us out at the table, but was also lending a hand behind the bar.  She and everyone at Sweet Auburn was upbeat, knowledgeable, and passionate!  It was obvious the workers we were able to interact with loved what they were doing and they were engaged with their customers.  They most definitely knew their food!  \n\nAnd the food, well,  of course the food was absolutely epic!  We told them a little about ourselves and said surprise us!  And did they ever!  Everything seemed to balance the traditional southern barbecue with a surprising kick of Asian flair!  Every bite was layered with flavors and spices, not just heat!  \n\nWe started with cornbread and something they called Hog Toast!  If I heard them correctly, apparently Sweet auburn raises their own hogs for this restaurant! Think of a huge chunk of bread with fantastically seasoned pork that melts in your mouth, surrounded by an assortment of flavorful greens and juicy tomatoes.  The meat was so tender, I could have had this alone for my meal.  Of course, the cornbread bucket was great...think southern sweet with a kick of heat!  It was the true epitome of what it means to be southern! \n\nFor my main entr\u00e9e I had the brisket plate and it was awesome.  The meat fell apart as I tore into it, and it paired very well with the steak frites someone at my table was foolish enough to order and sit right next me. Obviously I had to take some for myself!  Someone else got the pulled pork bowl, and it was phenomenal.  Anyone can do cheese grits, but these cheese grits were so rich and creamy,  the should count as my dessert, they were that good!  \n\nI also don't know how to brag on the food without mentioning the coffee flavored barbecue sauce they offered with a few other sauces I had no need to taste..because what I called the coffee sauce left me needing nothing else but to die happy.  I hope they do NOT bottle this barbecue sauce, or I'm going to be in trouble!  The side of green beans as well as the Brussel sprouts truly rounded out a great dinner!  \n\nFinally, everyone else in my group went with the Sangria, which they said was excel.  Sadly, I do not even remember what my drink was, but it was too good I now only have the picture to taunt me until I get back for another shot at it.  I also have to add we truly enjoyed asking the servers about the various food prep methods and the local farm to table ingredients and how they wrap this into good wholesome and delicious food!  Again, they knew their stuff and they are definitely not your run of the mill restaurant team.  \n\nEveryone In our group had a fantastic time and Sweet Auburn Barbecue left quite an impression on my picky friends.  I have to confess, I am now totally enraptured by Sweet Auburn that not only did I get back around to writing a review, I'm also already thinking about how soon I can get back there!  \n\nThe food was spot one, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was perfect for an indulgent and unique take on southern barbecue! \n\nAnd I'm truly in love with this restaurant.  I hope we are soon going steady!   Sweet Auburn, you rocked!",

However, my server was pretty helpful with helping me select items. \n\nI was super excited to try this place, but we got the wings which tasted totally plain. The ramen was alright, I'd say the best items was the fries and chopped brisket. However, the food was extremely greasy so that was a big bummer for us!",

It's diagonally across the street so if you're standing towards the four way with sweet auburn on your right behind you, go straight and the deck is on your left \n\nBut! This place is worth figuring it out bc it's delicious! \n\nThe brisket/pulled pork were a little saltier than I'd like but so tender & tasty. The short ribs were lit. So good. Would order again but it was a special so limited time only I think. \n\nThe shishito peppers were SO GOOD. A must try. Not an app id normally get but glad we did! \n\nThe drinks are strong & delicious. I had the daiquiri which isn't frozen and felt like a martini but refreshing & very nice. \n\nThey were super busy so there might be some waiting between sitting/ordering/food but worth it. Everyone was really nice though! \n\nWould go again when we're out that way",

They were perfectly creamy and everything.\nMac and cheese - the pictures from a few years ago looked amazing, the current recipe wasn't giving what it should have. It was also creamy, but had no flavor! \nJerk collards - great flavor, but undercooked IMO.\nBread pudding - comes with ice cream that tastes homemade, definitely the best part of the meal!

What I can tell you is that Sweet Auburn executes an asian flair to its menu. The sides include a great kimchi and the bar is stocked with many Japanese whiskeys.\n\nFrom an interior Sweet Auburn opts for the cool rustic cabin look. There are no decorations of concerningly nostalgic southern americana or recycled 6 pack containers as sauce holders. I think I remember seeing a taxidermied animal. There is plaid.\n\nThe brisket is unbelievably tender and it makes me wonder what secret Sweet Auburn knows. The menu changes often. We're lucky to have them in the neighborhood.",

                "text": "Sweet Auburn has a deck located close by for 2 hours free with validated parking or if you're lucky you can find street parking which is also free but not as plentiful.\n\nComing in on a rainy Saturday night there wasn't a wait! My partner has raved about this place being his favorite bbq place and spoiler alert: it left a lot to be desired for me at least due to the service. \n\nWe ordered the bucket of cornbread for the table for our starter as my partner talks about it all the time. This definitely was sooo good. Nice buttery, cornbread that's not dry and well seasoned. There's a touch of heat that's enjoyable and it's a really well done cornbread. \n\nI ordered the Two Meat Combo Plate with sliced lean brisket and pulled pork with mac and cheese & baked beans. My partner ordered the BBQ Sandwich with pulled pork and chili cheese fries.\n\nI rather liked my meats on my plate. Meat portions are small compared to the equivalent plate at Fox Bros tbh. Still good though! The Mac and Cheese was plated so cute on the tray being served in a small cast iron. The texture, consistency, and \"cheesy-ness\" of the mac and cheese was literally spot on, but with this being an Asian fusion bbq joint there was some spice in the mac and cheese that I personally didn't care for. Another in our party agreed while two others loved it, so 50/50. I wouldn't get it again, but it is my partner's go-to side. The bourbon baked beans do have meat in them and I liked them alright. They were extremely thick and when it was placed in front of me it was barely above room temp. The bread is fantastic and I loved the pickles and red onions. \n\nMy partner only had good things to say about his bbq sandwich which he devoured. The chili cheese fries were meh. The chili on them I didn't personally care for either with the spices they used.\n\nFood overall I would give a 3.5/5 because it was all well done besides their temp on my beans, but their choice in spices don't really hit the spot for me. \n\nService however was just not it. Our table were given these rather small glasses for our waters that fit maybe 1 cup of water if that? Small glasses are not an issue at all, but at other establishments there's usually a pitcher left at the table or the waiters come by rather frequently. Our table had our small glasses filled up only twice during our 1+ hour dinner? What's worse is looking at all the other tables that were seated that were given a pitcher or normal sized glasses of water for a restaurant?? I made eye contact with our waitress several times and she didn't come by plus she was standing most of time by the point of sale that had all the pitchers of water! Just doesn't make sense as she could have left a pitcher of water with our table rather than have \"good\" poor service. The other waiters that were working that night came to the tables they had way more frequently than our waitress came to ours. Just a disappointing experience as water is the bare minimum and leaving a pitcher out would have rectified the issue or just larger initial water glasses, but all other patrons were treated differently than our table. All 6 of our glasses on our table were empty when she came to ask if we wanted checks and didn't even ask to see if we wanted more water. \n\nPersonally, there are better bbq places in Atlanta with better service that I would much rather go to.",

But the second time I ordered the Crying Tiger Brisket which was pretty good. A nice variation form traditional bbq. I ordered my 5 year old the Mac and cheese and Brussel sprouts which were both decent. \n\nThe reason I give it 3 stars was because of the service. Now just to be clear our server was great he was as attentive and patient as he could be. It seemed like he was the only server on the floor at the time, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.\n\nThere were definitely a few other front of house staff hanging around including what seemed like at least a manager and a lead. When we came in it took forever for someone to greet us when what looked to be the manager and another lead having a meeting, we're facing the door. They didn't even stop to acknowledge any of us waiting. There were other staff walking around but again no one but our server acknowledged us. \n\nAs someone who has worked in the restaurant industry that's unacceptable. I don't care what a manager is doing if they are in eyesight of guests and your one server is busy, it's the managers responsibility to fill in. \n\nAnd I feel like it was a similar situation my first visit. It wasn't extremely busy but there was a lack in attentiveness and urgency. \n\nSo that's my rant. The food is ok not in a rush to go back.",

Seating closer to the bar had more of a sports vibe. Food was good, but surprisingly there wasn't much bbq on the menu. Parking was a challenge. Would recommend.",

I parked across the street in the public parking under the apartment building and they validated. Inside I was greeted and sat quickly. I ordered the wings as my entree and a side of wok fried green beans. I almost inhaled it when it arrived. I loved the smoked wings they're so flavorful and a good size. I could've eaten my weight in the green beans. They still have a nice crunch but they're cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. I've had sweet auburn many times and will continue to go back.

                "text": "I ordered takeout from here after looking on Yelp for some bbq spots near by. After seeing \"wu-tang wings\" on the menu I was very curious. Could these wu-tang wings be nothing to f**k with? \n\nSo I proceeded to order the overpriced 12-smoked wings for $25.50 and split the flavors with 6-bbq and 6-wu-tang to cure my curiously and my craving for bbq tonight. The wings were over cooked and very dry. The bbq flavor was extremely mild and underwhelming. The wu-tang wings were a tad better but honestly I believe that the wu-tang clan would feel sorely disappointed and disrespected with these wings baring their name. \n\nSorry Sweet Auburn but these wings are not worth the price. \n\nI also ordered 2 tini-tiny over priced sides. The small Mac-n-cheese for $5 was just okay and the small thai-chili brussels sprouts for $6.50 was the best thing I had here, actually those sprouts were pretty damn good. \n\nI also ordered the 5-layer chocolate cake and that wasn't great either. I'm all about my chocolate cake and this did not hit the spot. The texture wasn't appetizing, nor was the taste. \n\nOverall, not worth a second visit.",

It was a little busy on a Friday night and I ended up sitting at the bar. Bartender was very nice and helpful when I had questions about my options. I decided to go with the waggle brisket burger. And I didn't want just fries for the option so I decided to get the mac & cheese. The burger is probably one of the best burgers I've had.  The burger was cooked perfectly at medium and the brisket on top was so flavorful. It also comes with a dill and caper a\u00efoli and pickled red onions, bacon and Tillamook cheese. It sounds like a lot of things mixed together but it's perfectly balanced in goals so well. The burger was very filling I only ate half of it at the restaurant and took the rest with me. The mac & cheese is also pretty good. I'm definitely gonna go back to this restaurant and try out some more other items. It seems to be sort of a barbecue Asian fusion mix and I'm very intrigued about some of the other options on the menu.",

I ordered the brisket plate with 2 sides, and the $20 menu item came with perhaps 4oz of brisket presented as 4 pitifully small slices on a giant tray. Once I cut off the fat from my \"lean\" meat, I had a few bites to enjoy. There are several other excellent BBQ joints in Atlanta with more reasonable portions for the price, and I will definitely be going elsewhere in the future. Very sad as this used to be a favorite place.",

I ordered the 2 meat plate with chicken and brisket (brisket is extra) and it didn't disappoint. I gave it 4 stars because both meats weren't as tender as most bbq places I've been to. But they were still really good. Also the bbq for me didn't do it. I wish they had amazing bbq sauce because that would have been a game changer. Sides of Mac and cheese, baked beans and potato salad were all really good as well. I would definitely come back if I'm craving some bbq. \n\nAppetizer- the brisket chili with cornbread was amazing!!! The cornbread itself was so moist and delicious. Make sure you order that! \n\nDessert- skip the banana pudding. Way too sweet in my opinion. \n\nParking was street parking.",

Fusion lives up to this ideal, the rich history of the sweet auburn area coalesces with the new yuppy crowd, and we all enjoy the same food. I strolled in on a weekday afternoon and enjoyed the attentive service, curated menu, and overall experience of seeing the spin that they have on the classics. I got the wu tang wings and bbq plate. Tbh I came here just for the wings, but could not do this place justice without sampling the other offerings. The wings were on the pricey side, and are not your local wing kinda place, though they were definitely an experience to try and arguably the highest quality wings I've had. The bbq itself was solid though I will say it wasn't quite rock solid. What really popped were the sides. The mac and cheese was creamy, crunchy, and cheesy; textbook perfection. Then the carrots, who would've known that this was my biggest craving after leaving. It's Asian fusion flavors were poppin and the crunch was perfect. 10/10 best carrots I've had in my life. I will probably come back just for this. \n\nI can wax and wane about beauty, fusion, and how this place is striving to integrate all of the flavors and culture into one roof. Though my professor isn't there to read this anymore and bump my philosophy of the arts class grade :(. I would love to explore this menu further, surprisingly it wasn't the bbq that took the cake, though will definitely be back.",

They even have good vegetarian options! \nWill be back soon to try more.",
