From the pictures, it looked really nice, and it looks exactly like that in person, very beautiful decor and paintings and was spacious as well.\n\nUpon entering, it was dead (in their defense, it was rainy outside), but we were greeted with the smile sat at a beautiful table of our choosing. Shortly after we were then greeted by our waiter, who was great with us even spoke a little Spanish so that was a plus. \n\nTo start, I ordered the bottomless, passionfruit mimosas. One of the things that made me choose. This restaurant was the fact they used a Mexican sparkling brut. It was delicious!\n\nMy dining companion did not want an appetizer, so since I was starving I just got the sopa de ma\u00edz. It had the consistency of a chowder it was sweet but still good, I think it would've been better with another ingredient, perhaps chicken or something.\n\nFor our main brunch meals, I got the pescado sarandeado. Hey, seared salmon on the bed of poblano grits, with creamy tomato sauce, and Mexican chimichurri. I don't care for grits, but my meal was absolutely delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the flavor was impeccable! The person I was dining with got the mole de ajo negro- braised short rib on top of a corn mash. I thought the taste was okay but then again, I'm not a huge fan of mole. My dining companion liked it but, said there was too much fat and was still hungry when we left lol. This is a more upscale restaurant so the portions are palm sized she probably should've got an appetizer after all.",

Some traditional Latin flavors with a twist but nothing that takes away from the traditions of the culture. The octopus was cooked to perfection, the sopes were good but the meat needed to be either shredded or cut into smaller chucks to eat, and the sopes themselves needed to be a bit firmer. But still very flavorful. The ceviche was fresh and delicious. The scallops were huge and cooked just right. I would definitely recommend this place. We walked past after our showing at the Fox and I believe they have Spanish music to dance as it gets late.",

Now a bit more upscale, the atmosphere upon entering is so sleek and sexy, definitely a good \"date night spot\". They offer a different variety of things but I would highly recommend the carne asada paired with the brussels sprouts, you WONT be disappointed. I would also recommend a drink from their scratch bar from no one other than bartender \"Cocktail Papi\" don't get me wrong the other bartenders are great, but Papi is an experience. This place exceeded my expectations so much. Since going I find myself here at least twice a week. Service is great, host are friendly, no long waits. Overall I would definitely recommend giving this place a try, trust me you won't be disappointed.",

This is easy for a mexican restaurant to get right.  But they make it again and it was better.\n\nNow the food - \nhalibut with pasta - the dish sounded better than it tasted.

El Valle serves crafted cocktails with an Electric vibe. El Valle, classy Ambiance has a modern feel by welcoming a diverse crowd. El Valle has a small patio outside. Inside a beautiful living room space with a beautiful crowd of people. The bar area is nice and clean with comfortable bar chairs. I've been going to El Valle for over 12 months & the consistency with food, cocktails & service always fantastic. This stylish Mexican restaurant can be your one stop shop for a night out on the town. They have a DJ on weekends & regular live music throughout the week. El Valle is a good place for mingling, friend's meetup, birthday celebrations & brunch.  Their food is delicious! My favorite go-to dish is the Herb Guacamole, Tostada De Pulpo (octopus) & Tacos de Pescado flavored with spices complimenting your palate. I've gone on Friday nights with friends & Saturday's for Brunch. El Valle, parking is located in the back. This place gets really busy, get there early and Thank me later.",

                "text": "*FOOD*  I ordered the Tacos De Pollo (Chicken Tacos) and Elote-Style Corn Pudding to eat. The chicken tacos were moist, and they had a great classic flavor. The table wasn't a big fan of the Corn Pudding, though - we were expecting something closer to street corn. The pudding is more of a corn bread with corn in it topped with mayo and Tajin. \n\n*DRINKS* I ordered a Spicy Margarita and an Espresso Martini. The margarita was different than the classic style I was craving, but was still good. The martini was coffee-forward, which is my preference over a cream base. Some friends at my table got their staple Suave cocktail, and it was great. I'm not a huge fan of mezcal, but I was wishing I ordered it after trying it. \n\n*SERVICE*  Our server knew the menu like the back of his hand. Definitely felt like service at a more upscale spot without the white tablecloth price tag. \n\n*AMBIANCE*  I like the vibes of this spot for dinner or cocktails. They have some smaller cocktail tables in the bar area, which is really nice if you just want to pop in for drinks and not have to get a table for dinner. This spot turns into a club vibe at a certain time, so we came back later in the night to see what it was about. They had a DJ and were open until 3 am on the Saturday we went. Will definitely be returning on a classy night out.",

I'd definitely try it again but I'm not jumping to go back.\n\nI was able to get a same-day reservation on a Friday night, so that was nice, but the restaurant felt crowded when we arrived -- likely due to a show at The Fox. Service was pretty slow with it taking at least 5min before our server stopped by and then lots of time between other check-ins. We weren't in a rush so we didn't mind, and she did warn us that we wouldn't make it to the show in time if we were trying to get to that. The restaurant was pretty loud, so it was hard to hold a conversation at times, and the outdoor space seems nice and quieter but it's right along the sidewalk. I noticed diners getting interrupted by folks walking by and the street noise can sometimes be loud.\n\nTo eat, I had the soft shell crab appetizer and Brussels sprouts. The softshell crab was a bit small, but it was crispy and tasted good -- it could have had a bit more seasoning especially given the blandness of polenta, but it wasn't bad. The Brussels sprouts were very good -- crispy and nicely seasoned. I'd definitely get the Brussels sprouts again if I were to return. The cocktails were tasty and had some unique flavors, but they were overpriced.",

I was in town for a conference and found this place on Yelp, up the street from our hotel. \n\nCarlos was our server this past Sat (8/27/23) evening, and he didn't even try to accommodate the simple request. I wanted to try the tacos. I was willing to pay for the 3 chicken tacos and substitute one for cauliflower. You get 3 tacos. Two of the options were either chicken or cauliflower. I wanted 2 chicken and 1 cauliflower. I asked to substitute and stated I would pay the higher price, which is chicken, and without him even inquiring, he quickly said no. I even stated again you could charge me for the chicken substitute one of the cauliflower. Again, he just said no. Isn't that unbelievable?!!! And just simply ridiculous!  \n\nSuch a cute spot. However, when I return to ATL again, I will not be returning. I'm not sure how that score is so high. The food was bland, too. Please see below. \n\n\nFOOD **/.75\nCallo de Acha con risotto de chorizo (seared scallops and risotto). What I ended up ordering since I couldn't get the tacos as requested above. I had to add the green sauce to enjoy the meal. No flavor. Extremely bland on both scallops and risotto. \n\nTacos de pollo (chicken tacos) ***/.5\nWithout the sauce, 3 stars, and with the sauce 4 stars, so 3.5\nChicken isn't seasoned or barely where it tasted bland as well. What my dad ordered. He said the green sauce made it more enjoyable. \n\nStars 1 + 2.5 + 3.5 = Average of 2.42",

The food and cocktails were TOP NOTCH and the vibe and ambience set the stage for an awesome dinner. We tried several of the happy hour small plates (guacamole, Mac n cheese, shrimp taco, beef brisket taco) and the scallops with risotto! 10 out of 10! Camilo was an excellent bartender and we enjoyed the energy of the bar and watching as he made each outgoing drink (I had the sangria) with care and pizazz! We will definitely be returning when we are in Atlanta!!",

It was a nice twist on Mexican food with plenty of yummy options. \n\nI got the chicken stuffed with mushrooms..this was my favorite dish that I have had in a while! It looked like bread when it first came out lol, but I ate every last bite. The sauce with it was the perfect pairing. \n\nI got a beautiful drink that was strong!! The bartender was amazing, never let me go a second without another round. \n\nThe atmosphere was on point! We sat at the bar, but there were tables and a lounge space where you could sit and eat. There is parking in the back and you don't have to pay, you just have to tell the hostess your license plate number and you are good there until they give you a time.",

                "text": "If you are looking for superb service, exquisite food, reasonable prices and excellent drinks, this is the place for you!  This is my favorite eatery in Atlanta. Formerly EL Scorpion, this newly reimagined space is perfect for brunch AND dinner. I've been here three times since they have opened and each experience gets better than the last.  \n\nI always opt to be seated on the front patio so I can people watch which is always entertaining lol. The patios are covered and temperature controlled. now parking (literally the determining factor for dining downtown): they have a lot directly behind the building which if free for three hours if you dine at the restaurant.  You don't need a ticket; just give the hostess your license plate and they will take care of the rest. There is also street parking parallel to the building.\n\nI've been here for brunch, dinner and one occasion both lol. I could literally spend all day here just trying everything off the menu. But I will give you my top eats.\n\nBrunch:\nCARNITAS HASH - flavor town!! cooked to perfection and just absolutely one of the best breakfast hash I've ever had!\n\nTRES LECHE FRENCH TOAST - The toppings tend to change due to the season but I had the tropical one and the French toast was two pieces of buttery goodness with a thinly sliced camrelized banana in the middle topped with chantilly cream! If you prefer sweet meals for brunch, this is it.\n\nSMOKED SALMON TOSTADA - think the best smoked salmon bagel but make it Mexican lol truly delicious! I wish this was on their dinner menu as an appetizer. \n\nDinner:\nHALIBUT CEVICHE- I've never had ceviche with Halibut, so I was pleasantly surprised and instantly addicted lol I order that every time I go here now as my app.\n\nBRANZINO - This was my first time having branzino and I can say this is the true star of the dinner menu. It's wrapped in a Hoja Santa Leaf and definitely sets the bar first with presentation but completely follows through with flavor. This is my favorite thing on the menu! The serving is definitely on the smaller size but I still fully enjoy it!\n\nDESSERT\nHORCHATA PANNA COTTA - If you have room left, I HIGHLY recommend the panda cotta. I've had panda cottas before, and in my opinion are very hard to perfect with flavor. I never had a horchata so I was intrigued and it paid off lol. This is my favorite dessert item. I love it!!\n\nHonorable mention goes to deconstructed s'mores. Nothing super special about it besides the presentation is nice and its a perfect share item for the table.\n\nThey also have an amazing wine list especially the roses! They also have mimosa carafes starting at $45 during brunch on Sundays.",

Perfect for a first date, date night, or just catching up with the girls. They are open late which is nice, and if you're lucky...there is a parking lot right behind the building in which they validate! The parking lot might be a little tricky to find if you don't know what you're looking for. If you're coming down Peachtree and the restaurant is on your right, there will be a little opening right before you get to the corner with the red light.\n\nEveryone was so accommodating, so helpful, and so nice. there is a little outside seating, there is a dining room area, a bar, and even a lounge. The lounge area is filled with couches and low tables, so it might be hard to eat a meal there, but nevertheless, super cute and perfect for a date situation.\n\nI ordered the chips and guacamole and the chicken tacos. I can tell that everything was made with high-quality items, and nothing lacked flavor. Our waitress was so helpful in providing recommendations, especially for the drinks. I ended up ordering the Labios Rotos and I was kinda nervous about it because I've had similar drinks at different places that weren't that tasty. However, I trusted the waitress and went with it. Great choice if you enjoy a strong, but tasty drink!\n\nI'm going to check out some of their events during the week. I'll definitely be back.",

My husband even tried it and he likes spicy food and said it was really spicy so just be careful if spice is not your life lol I would say the service was just average. We waited quite a while for the bill and it wasn't even busy so that was slightly annoying. Probably won't be back but it was worth trying once.",

We ordered the halibut ceviche which was beautifully plated, the sopa de maiz, the tacos de pescado and the sopes de carnitas. The corn soup was creamy with a slight heat from the poblano peppers and you could taste really pieces of corn.  The sopes had great flavor and the pork belly was perfectly cooked.  The sopes themselves were tough to cut through and made it difficult to eat without lots of effort.  \n\nOverall we enjoyed the experience and would return again in the future.",

He picked us up from the airport and took us here. This is a great place. We sat at the bar and enjoyed cocktails and munched on the ceviche and delicious skirt steak. The vibe here is wonderful. Mellow but vibrant. If you find yourself in Atlanta from Philly trying to get to Dallas, I highly recommend. But truly, I recommend it regardless.",

I think I had the Mariposa Traicionera and another one with a beautiful flower inside. Both were refreshing. \n\nAppetizers: Corn soup is smooth and flavorful. \n\nFood: \nSope de camar\u00f3n are Exquisite. \n Huevos Rancheros were everything you'd hope they would be and more. \nFrench Toast (not pictured because I devoured it) A MUST HAVE IF YOU EAT HERE. We had it as a dessert and even though I was full I couldn't stop eating this amazing dish. \n\nService: 10/5 stars because there was never a moment that we felt we weren't being given attention. The servers are kind, knowledgeable of the menu and friendly. \n\nParking: suggest you validate with the host when you come in. Give them the tag # of your car. \n\nOverall PLEASE visit this location if you're in town.",

I always go for the Piel Canela, which consists of Saint Theresa Rum, Cacao Liquor, Gifford Banana, and Scrappy's Chocolate Bitters. It's creamy and tastes like an ice cream sundae if you're into that kind of drinking experience. For spice lovers, they have the Suave: Banhe Mezcal, Agave, Poblano Pepper, and Lime. I have to take a moment to brag on the presentation too - some of their cocktails also come with edible flowers. And the drinks are strong too, so I'd suggest taking an Uber or Lyft. \n\nAs for the menu options, I can't get enough of the Halibut Ceviche and the Tostada de Pulpo.  Their food is fresh and light, and you won't walk away feeling uncomfortably full. The staff is also extremely personable and courteous, it's some of the best services I've had in Atlanta! El Valle is innovative, it's upscale without being pretentious, and I'm probably going there this weekend ;)",

So glad a restaurant nearby closed early due to \"understaffing\" (that just means they don't pay enough to keep employees) and recommended this place. \n\nPerfect fish tacos, a great portion and delicious flavors. Really great cheesy sweet potatoes. And a ridiculously delightful cocktail, the Bonita y Mentirosa. \n\nVery attentive and friendly staff. Definitely will be back next time I'm in town. \n\nNOTE: the kitchen closes earlier than the bar does, so double check if you're coming late for food.",

Service was fantastic; we were given the happy hour menu. We ordered: guac, mussels (I don't like mussels so didn't try these), the burger, crispy taquitos, and mac & cheese. I've had better mac & cheese-- it was a little cold and the taste was okay. But gotta say, the taquitos from the happy hour menu we're fantastic. Really liked them. Cocktails were also fun and the furniture set-up is neat, too. Very modern-looking. I want to come back and try other items from the menu next time.\n\n**Also: if you stress out about parking, like I do, know you can validate parking to have it be free for three hours. We stayed over three hours because it was such a cool vibe.",

They offer contemporary Mexican food that does not disappoint. \nAll of the food & cocktails were amazing and it was seriously the best location! We ate here for dinner and walked to a show at The Fox; it was literally a 3 minute walk to the theatre AND they validate parking for 2 hours.\nWe got the Ceviche, guac, cauliflower tacos, chicken tacos, and the Brussels sprouts- it was all delicious. I am obsessed with the ceviche- literally the best ceviche I've ever had! And the guac was amazing too. I want to come back and try everything else including their Mexican wines!",

The food is everything and great portions. Tacos de pescado, herb guacamole with the best chips, and the Brussels are also a must order. Sparkling water or just water and the server was very attentive to our large party. I went back the next day for dinner, dinner post up next.\nDinner the next day was served by MJ. She was very attentive and noticed the table was a little rocky and got down on her knees to adjust the legs to resolve the issue without hesitation. I opted for the chicken tacos and herb guacamole and we shared the ceviche. We opted to dine outside on the patio which was great weather but was disturbed by our city's urban camper who wanted money. The cocktail presentation cute and taste was on point. All my guest that ask for restaurant finds in the area will be guided to MJ and ElValle every time I'm asked hands down. Birthday dinner party will be booked here",

Oh and did I mention the daily weekday happy hour. \n\nWhether you're out for drinks with friends, a romantic date, or just want to sit at the bar for a bite, this place can accommodate.",
