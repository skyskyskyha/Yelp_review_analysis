We enjoyed the Mediterranean style salads, and savored every bite of our meals.  Turkish Mousaka does not use potatoes so it had a lighter body and texture.  It was delicious.  \nwe enjoyed the decor as well.  the walls have murals of windows looking into Turkish landscapes.\nWe will return soon.",

The mood and the lighting was just right and just. And of course free parking is what I'm all about.\nThe service was great. Friendly, not bothersome and attentive.\nFinally the food. The food was delicious. Both my date and I ordered the Adana kebab. She also had a glass of pinot and I had a beer.

                "text": "Whenever I am near Buckhead, there's only one restaurant I think about going: Cafe Agora. I trust the authenticity of the food from here. And always looking forward to the rice puddling they give at the end. I post a lot of Asian food and rarely Mediterranean, so I look forward to learn & share more in the future. \n\nDolma has a pleasant fresh tarte taste, it's soft and filling (since it's stuffed with rice). First time having grape leaves and everything works together very well. I recommend at least trying this at least once. \n\nHummus ain't strong in flavor like the ones you get at the store (which can be overly salted). The flavor hits in the after taste. Light in color so you know it's fresh.\n\nSigara Boregi Beef - imagine crispy spring rolls that's savory and packed with beef whenever you take a bite, then you will like this. Wish this came in fours so we don't have to split the last one.\n\nChicken Shish Kebab is a classic dish. I'm a lamb lover but chicken was tasty too. I always enjoy the fresh greens they serve with it.\n\nLamb Shank (dinner menu) - I crave this dish but I can't get it alone. The lamb is soft & perfectly cooked off the bone. The tomato sauce is delicious but the tartness can be overwhelming. The only veggies are roasted tomato and green bell pepper. This is why I need the salad from my partner's plate. It makes the dish balanced.\n\nDoner Kebab Plate - not my dish but the fries were fantastic. \n\nPistachio Baklava - The first time I was served Baklava, it was the size of a brick. When I saw their portion, I was disappointed by the contrast. But learning how sweet this dessert was, it's meant to be a one-biter. This pastry is very sweet & sticky but I enjoy the crispiness on the top.\n\nSutlac (Turkish Rice Pudding) - They serve a small cup of this when you checkout which is the perfect ending to any meal. I always debate if I should get one togo. \n\nFollow me on socials for more foodie finds @yvon_ow",

It's in downtown buckhead, but it's away from the busy streets, so it was nice and quiet. First we got the sigara rolls. They remind you of a taqueria but light and airy. We got ground beef inside and it was flavored really well with parsley, dill and herbs. Paired great with the homemade titzki. Overall those were 10/10. Actually, they were so good, we got a second order. They come with 3 per order. \n\nVinny was our waiter and he was so nice and patient. One of us got lamb chops, and it came with 4 handsome pieces. They weren't too gamy and they were cooked perfectly. A perfect medium! Came with a salad and a bed of rice that was moist and beautifully flavored. \n\nThen we got a platter of falafel. It came with 4 big falafels, 4 pieces of pita, Greek salad with balsamic dressing, and hummus. It was all great! \n\nThen they gave us both little cups of rice pudding. It was a sweet little complimentary dessert, a pleasant surprise! \n\nCan't wait to go back!",

                "text": "Decent Turkish cuisine.  But, nothing really outstanding.  In other words, it was just average. The best item was their mezze appetizer featuring various dips and spreads.  I think most people would like that one (see picture).  \n\nThe entree options were kind of limited.  Mostly gyros or skewers.  Other than that, there's 2 fish entrees and mousaka.  I had the chicken and the flavor was fine.  But, I've had similar at the ubiquitous Greek quick service places.  \n\nOther than the food being average, I was also annoyed by how they dealt with my kids orders.  My daughter ordered off the kids menu.  My son (11 years old) asked for the salmon.  I interrupted him while ordering and said that he needed to select the kids meal options (which didn't include salmon -- which was a $23 item).  He ordered the same thing as my daughter.  So, when the food came out, the waiter brought a kids size for my daughter and an adult entree for my son!  This was done despite him hearing me correct him and order the kids entree!  \n\nOverall:  A pass.  Not really worth it.  It's average.",

                "text": "We went here for my Friend's birthday two days ago around 1pm. My friend reserved a table for 14 people inside and was hoping to have a great time overall. However, a few unfortunate incidents took place that I thought of sharing. \n\nThe very First thing that went Wrong: \nThe host was walking towards the door of the restaurant from the patio and we were right behind him. He clearly saw us so I thought he would hold the door but it slammed right on our faces which shows he did not bother. \n\nSecond incident: \nNo greetings at all or asking how we are. He just asked if we had a reservation and I said yes, the rest of the party is already seated so should I just go look for them or do you know where they are seated? His response: There are too many people in there but go ahead see if you can find your friends. I did not like his tone at all.\n\nThird incident: \nWe are sitting for almost 30 mins, no one showed up and asked if we wanted anything to drink or wanted any appetizers. Finally, he came and with an attitude took everyone's orders- wasn't interested in explaining the menu or anything.\n\nFourth incident: \nTwo of our friends needed to leave early so they asked if they could get their check, our server says: No there is only one check so I cannot separate it now. My friend said, well but we were all gonna pay separately, is there any way you could try that? The server said: No it is not possible for me to make separate checks since you didnt tell me during ordering. So don't you think he should have asked us if it will be one check or separate? Because all the restaurants ask about it before they bring you the check. How are we supposed to know to let him know before we ordered the food? So I requested and said: I am sorry we cannot pay all together, we would have told you if you asked but we would really appreciate if you try to separate it. His response: OH MY GOD! and he leaves. \n\nFifth incident: \nWhen we were done eating, we wanted to cut the cake so we asked if they could clear the table a bit but no one bothered to do that, instead he asked us to walk up to the register and pay before leaving. \n\nHow is this professional at all in a restaurant like Cafe Agora? It is a nice elegant restaurant so we expect to receive the check and not walk up and pay like we do in fast foods because I am paying extra money for the service too. \n\nWell, the food was great and I would love to go just for the Adana Kabob or even the mixed grill platter, however, the service is really poor and that makes me not want to go ever again. Our server was Daniel, I hope he understands that these kinds of behavior can really ruin someone's birthday lunch and it is not professional at all.",

                "text": "Cafe Agora in Midtown Atlanta has been our go-to place for a quick and excellent Greek meal. \n\nMy favorite item on the menu is the Lamb Gyro. The juicy lamb is well-seasoned and served with a zesty tzatziki sauce over warm fluffy pita bread. The portion size is considerable, making it a filling alternative for anyone with a ravenous appetite.\n\nMy wife usually orders the Lamb Gyro Platter, which she adores. It features all of the famous Lamb Gyro flavor as well as a side of fluffy rice, a Greek salad, and warm pita bread. The plate provides a well-balanced dinner.\n\nWe usually always order Fried Eggplant to go with our gyros. It's a delicious appetizer that's difficult to pass up.\n\nWhile we prefer to order our food to go, we've had the opportunity to dine in on a few occasions, and the environment at Cafe Agora is welcoming. The staff is polite and helpful, making every visit enjoyable.\n\nCafe Agora is a definite must-visit if you're in the Midtown Atlanta neighborhood and seeking great Mediterranean cuisine. Whether you like their Lamb Gyro or their Lamb Gyro Platter. Cafe Agora is one of our favorite restaurants to visit because of its pleasant service and consistently wonderful food.",

I was a little hesitant when I pulled in to park because the place looked empty. I chose to sit outside and there was one other family outside dining. However, after sitting for about five minutes, I quickly realized that Cafe Agora stays busy with takeout orders. I kid you not, during the 40 minutes or so I was there, I counted at least 30 people come in to pick up their takeout orders. Now for the food, I ordered:\n\n1. Turkish Potatoes ($8) - Quite tasty! I'd order these again.\n\n2. Mix Gyro Plate ($15) - Chicken & Lamb. Also served with rice, salad, pita bread and tsazitki  sauce. The lamb was amazing! The chicken was flavorful as well, but the lamb stole the show here.\n\n3. Chicken Shish Kebab ($17) - Also very tasty and served with rice, salad, pita bread and tsaziki sauce. \n\nThe serving portions are huge! Was definitely too full to order dessert. However, the owner brought out samples of their rice pudding with a little cinnamon sprinkled on top. It was good! Overall, I had an enjoyable time at Cafe Agora!",

Flaky dough wrapping nicely seasoned beef, a must try. Speaking of must tries -- the agora mixed platter. This place seasons their meats extremely well, something that honestly isn't as common as you'd hope. \n\nI could harp on & on about how happy we were to run into Cafe Agora when we did, but I'll save it for next time. \nI'll be back",

                "text": "We were in this area a bit before noon on a Sunday, primarily to visit the Christkindl holiday market thing in Buckhead Village. After an initial stroll through there, nothing really drew me in food-wise. We had walked by Caf\u00e9 Agora on the way there; it was only 2 doors (or empty lots) down the street, so we opted to have lunch there. \n\nI've seen this place for a while. I have not visited Buckhead with anything approaching frequency for a long time, so I'm not sure exactly how long this place has been here; their website didn't say. It feels like it has been there for a while, though. They appeared to have their own (small) parking lot. There is parking available nearby in decks and on-street (both for a fee).\n\nThey appeared to have limited patio seating, but the weather was cold with some light drizzle, so no one was going for that. They have a large interior dining room and appeared to have some bar seating as well (though it was closed off at the time). \n\nThe menu had a surprising array of choices given that it was basically just one page. In addition to a few sorts of gyros, they also had fish, at least a couple of types of kabobs, a decent selection of appetizers, etc. We both went for the gyro, which also included a small salad. \n\nThe portion size wasn't overwhelming, but neither was it skimpy.  I didn't particularly want leftovers but I was able to finish my plate without feeling overly full. The gyro itself was very flavorful.  Both of us enjoyed our salads; they were small, but with a large variety of vegetables. \n\nPrices were not outrageous despite their location in Buckhead.\n\nI was expecting a rather average dining experience here, but was quite pleasantly surprised. I will definitely keep this place in mind should I be in Buckhead again at meal-time.",

We took our time ordering & did ask for recommendations or specials, but the Waiter didn't have any to give. Food came out pretty quickly from the time we ordered. Everything was tasty & portions were a nice size. We asked for lemon for our water, but it never came. We didn't get checked on or have our water refilled. It was as if they forgot about us. Overall the food is good but three stars for the lack of attentiveness, especially when it wasn't busy. I'd come again in case this was a one-off. Also a Waiter should be able to recommend dishes, even if it's to mention their favorite.",
