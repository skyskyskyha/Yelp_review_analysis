                "text": "I loved roasters.  The food they have is solid comfort food that may put you to sleep lol.  I had the white chicken chili (super filling), ribs, chicken tenders, loaded potato, and bread.  Now it may sound odd to say bread...but they have these muffins without panties (that paper that muffins come in usually) and biscuits that are damn everything!\n\nThe service was good.  The last time that I went, we sat outside and they had a leak that was leaking on our table.  Trying to convey what was happening to the manager was a little bit pointless because he kept looking at the pipe instead of moving our table, so we moved ourselves.  But the waitstaff was super friendly and understanding, even when we had to shift seats all together.   I wont take off for the whole pipe thing though, it can happen to anyone.\n\nThe muffins and biscuits, they are not free like other restaurants, but they are so worth it.  They come out warm and the butter spreads so easily, we ordered a few baskets of those (which probably led to us getting full lol).  The chili I ordered I thought was going to be a small bowl, nope!  It was huge and was probably the reason that I didnt finish my food!  But thats okay.  The Ribs were pretty flavorful and the chicken tenders were really good with that honey mustard.   The potato needed extra sour cream but once I got that, it got devoured too.  I want to try something else but I would have no issue getting what I got last time all over again. \n\nThis spot is not the best food in the world but if you want good and solid comfort food, this one hits for me every time.  Depending on what time of day you go, you will have to fight for parking though so just be aware of that (the brunch spot across the parking lot has a lot of traffic).  This is a winner to me.",

                "text": "I've been going to different locations of this restaurant for probably 25 years. Roasters is consistently good - that's an impressively long time to be consistent. The ingredients are great and I physically feel like I've had home cooking after a meal here. I don't feel heavy or like I've had too much salt like some places. \nI've never ordered anything I didn't like but some of my favorites are their yeast rolls, corn bread, Mac and cheese, broccoli cauliflower casserole, cinnamon apples, cucumber salad, and chicken fingers. \nTheir queso appetizer, though delicious, does unfortunately get thick and then pretty much solid weirdly fast - and the leftovers don't heat up well - it stays really thick. \nObviously their roasted chicken is great. \nThe ambiance is homey, not fancy, but always feels clean and maintained. \nI do wish they'd carry blue moon again.\nIt's a nice experience to eat in the restaurant and also to get to go.\nParking was much more plentiful before Toast opened in the same center. So if you are going during peak brunch hours (Toast has has a brunchy vibe), know that parking will take some time and I've noticed some drivers can be quite aggressive in the lot during these times as well. So be careful and patient during these times. \nIf you haven't tried Roasters, I recommend you do!",

My granddaughter ordered the cheese dip, a cheeseburger and, for dessert, vanilla ice cream. She didn't complain, but I could see that she finished off only the ice cream. I ordered the grilled chicken breast, the cauliflower/broccoli casserole, mac-n-cheese, and fried okra. The chicken had the weirdest sauce ever - I can't even describe it - but it was not edible. The casserole was a lumpy mess, covered with way too much cheese. The fried okra was greasy - they really need to change the oil more often in their deep fryers. The mac-n-cheese was just alright. This place is not recommended.",

                "text": "So I finally tried Roasters and have to say it's pretty damn good home cooked meals. When I have my lazy days but want something good I usually lean towards Boston Market style food.\n\nNot sure what Boston Market is doing but they have butchered their menu even more regarding sides and now I've discovered Roasters because of it.  For about 20-$30 you can get a menu of appetizers to choose from, 2 entrees and 2 sides with a soup. The day I ordered I opted for a spinach dip, chicken and rice soup, an order of tenders and a qtr chicken with mashed potatoes and spinach. The food was healthy, filling and delicious! This is my new spot for quick wholesome meals.  The tenders are probably some of the best I've had and aren't covered in a thick crunchy batter. They have a batter but offer more chicken and not overly salted. The dipping sauces that come with them are delicious as well.",

I thought the pork might overpower the rest of the soup or make it heavy so I was pleasantly surprised when it seemed to take a back seat to the black beans. The homemade cobbler was extremely hot, in fact too hot so I had to let it sit for several minutes even though there was ice cream on top. There was a nice blend of cinnamon to the sugar on top, the way a peach cobbler should be. Overall a nice spot to stop and try.",

I don't remember coming before but he assures me I did. When we pulled into the plaza I was concerned when I saw how crowded it was.  Then I realized it was located across the parking lot from Toast on Lenox and it was still brunch time so not great timing on our part. Luckily for us our choice was not so crowded.  They offered dining inside or outside and I chose outside since the weather was unseasonably warm.  Also the inside looked as if it's seen better days.  The outside was actually enclosed and they didn't have the vinyl panels open so no fresh air.  But we were the only ones on the patio so still not bad. \nOur waiter was on point from start to finish, bringing things before we could even ask like a to-go container and bag. \nMy husband knew what he wanted right away, rotisserie chicken ($13/half chicken comes with 2 sides).  But before that he insisted that we order bread, rolls and cornbread.  Once it arrived I could see why. They were served warm with butter and were very good.  Apparently they used to be complimentary but are now .50\u00a2 each.  Worth it. I went with the fried chicken lunch special ($17/four pieces {leg, wing, breast, thigh} and two sides).  The order came out quick almost like fast food speed. \nThe chicken was hot temperature wise and had good flavor.  The sides were pretty good but not as hot.  We finished with peach cobbler ala mode and it did not disappoint.  \nGood food, great service and we were in and out in no time.",

Close the nice German at the front  went to the back to see if they could sever us everyone said yes. Man, that was very awesome of them.\nThe food was Prepared excellent and you could tell it was not rushed and the presentation was awesome. Even our waiter was very tentative and did not rush us at all.\nThank you guys for the experience I had at your restaurant and trust and believe that every time I come back in town to visit family and friends, I will always. Make sure I'll stop by and patronize your restauright. The ambience is actually made for a couple or a family which which makes it very nice.\nHave a great rest of 2023.",

                "text": "Really heartbreaking to say this, but this restaurant has chosen to squeeze their patrons for every penny to the point that it is insulting. They raised all prices on the menu by $1-2 which is completely understandable. But immediately after enacting the new prices, they have begun other practices as well. Free complimentary cornbreads and rolls? Nope - now 65\u00a2 each. Want two dipping sauces for your chicken tenders? You'll pay 50\u00a2 for that second sauce. Are you walking in the heat and wanna pop in for a glass of water? That'll be $1 at the bar. The food is tasty and the servers are kind and courteous (shout out to Bree and Brendan and Isaac), but when your bill is suddenly $8 more just because you ordered bread for the table of 6 and a couple of sauces for your chicken is really steep and leaves a bad impression on patrons. To be noted, though the bread charge is on a note on the tables, none of the other surcharges are notated anywhere on the menu. So it truly is a surprise at checkout and it's noticeable in the lack of clientele. I'm currently writing this on their empty patio on a lovely Friday evening at 6:20pm (dinner rush) and the only tables here are my party of 3 and a party of 5. Inside, there are 4 tables. And barely any takeout orders going out either. Really sad to see this establishment drowning.",

They have a great patio they use even during the winter with overhead heating.  I will say when it's extremely cold the patio is not comfortable as they have some gaps in their plastic surround.  \nOne thing has changed, their rolls are just not the same but that's ok I think their corn muffins got better!\nYou can always trust on getting a fresh salad at Roasters too.  \nLenox Road can be a pain but there's a light to get into and out of this parking lot.",

Ive even had my co workers hooked on the place.  Sunday, my wife went to order a whole chicken with 2 sides and mexican chicken with 3 sides. Sunday, i ate the mexican chicken with 2 sides no problems. Today i opened the container with chicken and there were no legs included. My wife called the place just to tell them that there were no legs. She was not looking for a refund just calling to let them know for training purposes but they were treating her like she was trying to get over. All we were looking for was accountability and acknolegement that they made a mistake. Nothing. Oh well, i wont be going back.",

My dad and I both got the special, which was basically a bacon burger on sourdough bread. Nothing special, but it popped once we added tobacco sauce on it. I got broccoli cauliflower casserole on the side and he opted for fried okra. \n\nAlso, our server was soooo sweet. She really made the experience better.

In 60 years of traveling the globe I never recall having a lobby closed down to guests unless their were repairs.

It was not. \n\nWe got:\nThe chicken tenders with black eyed peas and broccoli/cauliflower casserole. The chicken fingers are like fish and chip type of fried chicken tenders. They are beer battered which I was pleasantly surprised by! The portions were a little small though. The fingers were a little bigger than nuggets but definitely not your typical tender sized. Casserole was cheesy and delicious. Black eyed peas were tasty as well! The salt and seasoning they used helped. \n\nRotisserie chicken fingers with Mac and cheese, and spinach. This was okay. Again, portions were a little smaller than I thought they would be. Mac and cheese was good. Tasted similar to the broccoli/cauliflower casserole except without carbs :). Spinach was, well spinach. \n\nOverall, good food with a little smaller sized portion. The staff was very friendly during my interaction which is definitely a big plus in my book. I'd say 8 Gryffindor points out of 10.",

Like, if I had to make a last meal request for some odd reason, it would most certainly be Country Fried Steak, fried okra, mac-n-cheese, a corn muffin and sweet tea. So, with that being said...this is exactly what I get when I come to Roasters, without fail, every time. And it is so dang good every single time! \n\nTo start, Roasters is located in a small shopping center on Lenox Road that features a sushi place, taco place and a few other random businesses. Roasters sits on the end and directly on Lenox Road and features a decent size indoor seating dining room and a decent size covered patio. I have had the pleasure of dining on both and they are equally suitable to devour a plate of southern food on. \n\nI will say that I was consistently looking for a solid, well priced, casual southern food joint and I have definitely found it in Roasters. As previously mentioned, my go-to is the Country Fried Steak. Here it is priced at $11.99 and comes with 2 sides...but really it comes with 3 bc it is served on a bed of mashed potatoes! I always go with the staples for me of friend okra and mac-n-cheese. Neither of which ever disappoint. Prior to your meal being delivered, they provide the table biscuits and/or corn muffins with butter. Just get them both and enjoy, as they are delivered hot and fresh each time! Additionally, be prepared to take a to-go box home with you, as the servings are quite large for the price! \n\nOverall, Roasters is a solid choice for southern food in Buckhead and shoot, all of Atlanta. Don't fret if you aren't a big southern cuisine aficionado, they have a massive menu with everything from hot dogs to quesadillas. Simply put, you will find something you like! \n\nGo. Just do it. I promise you will enjoy it!",

Take out is what most people get, and its great, but the sit down service is very attentive.\n\nThe corn bread is top notch, sweat, crusty, and buttery. The rolls are better than average. The large variety of classic southern sides is incredible. Some stand outs for me are the pan fried apples and the sweet potato casserole. (They call them slightly different names tho)\n\nThe tenders were probably my least favorite thing here. They use the same breading as they do on their country fried chicken, and it works gloriously on that, but is a bit too thick on the tenders. Still good tho. The rotisserie chicken is the main star. Its roasted to perfection, and their house bbq sauce is perfectly crafted for it.\n\nGreat value and great food.",

I got the veggie plate with Lima beans, dressing, green beans, and broccoli/cauliflower casserole. I added the sweet potato souffl\u00e9. The Lima beans tasted weird; I can't explain it. The dressing was entirely too sweet. The green beans tasted like they were straight from a can. The casserole was fine. The souffl\u00e9 left much to be desired. The best thing was the cornbread and roll, which is what bumped it up from one star. I won't be coming back.",

From the spinach dip to the barbecue ribs, we loved it all! We both had Sangrias in these huge gobblers (Red & Peach), I couldn't even finish mine....I swear everytime I took a sip, someone was adding to it. Lol.... the tortilla chips for our dip were baked fresh. The cornbread is absolutely amazing. It was a lot of food, so much that I have enough for lunch tomorrow. This location is in a strip mall on Lenox Rd, about a mile south of Lenox Mall. It's a real low-key place, so wear anything. Very diverse crowd.... great staff. Our server Lamar was fantastic--- he only works on Sundays. They have indoor and outdoor seating, so weather permitting.... enjoy! You will not be disappointed!",
