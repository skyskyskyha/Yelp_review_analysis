It was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a while. \n\nFirstly, it took our server close to 15 minutes to come take our order, despite it not being super busy. He wasn't very friendly, and he took a long time to even bring us water. Our glasses were empty for a while, and then we had to flag someone else down to get us more to drink. \n\nThe food came out eventually, and it was ok tasting but there were so many errors that it was frustrating. I don't think I would return here because the prices don't reflect the service or food.",

                "text": "We came here on Saturday to catch a vibe and some good drinks and food. Had high hopes for TDH but left feeling unsatisfied. \n\nFirst the customer service is lacking here is lacking. It took some time before anyone came to our table and then even more time before we were offered drinks. It took about an hour for the food to come out and we were told twice that they did not have the items that we ordered, basic items such as Mac and cheese. \n\nThat was disappointing of course but we made substitutions and still eagerly awaited our food.  We heard our waitress making fun of one of the people in our party and that was disappointing as well she was laughing about the fact that they did not have an item we ordered and how they were just going to put something else on the plate.  At that point we were less than excited about our food. \n\nThe food finally came and the turkey legs I ordered were dry and hard to chew. The skin was very tough. They came with baked beans instead of the macaroni that I wanted so that wasn't as good as it could've been. \n\nAlso the drinks were weak and did not really get us tipsy at all. I noticed that gratuity is included so I believe that's why we didn't get the best customer service. I do not believe I will go back to TDH at all. Hopefully others have a better experience there.",

The bartender was our server for the entire restaurant. She was fast, but the restaurant was pretty fill by the time we left. \n\nOrdered the beef brisket planter with greens (but they brought out Mac and cheese so I kept it) and a side house salad. The salad was good, nothing spectacular. Lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, onions and cheese. Dressing is important and the ranch was super thick and creamy. The brisket was AMAZINGLY tender, juicy and well seasoned! One of the best that I've had. Just a tad fatty, but the meat was great!! The Mac and cheese is very creamy!! Not seasoned much, but it hit the spot. The cornbread muffin was light, fluffy, moist and sweet. Enjoyed it at the end as it reminded me of dessert.\n\nDefinitely coming back to try to happy hour specials!",

But if you want something quieter, I'll advise to dine downstairs or order to go. \n\nMenu items didn't disappoint. I ordered a Smoked Plate with wings (half dozen) and my 2 sides were collard greens and Mac & cheese.  My cocktail of choice was the Hennessy Peach Tea. I enjoyed everything. I was too stuffed from my meal to try a dessert. I'd definitely visit again when in the city.",

                "text": "The website promised great BBQ, but they didn't exactly deliver. \n\nLocation and Parking \nTDH is located on Pryor Rd, near 656 Bar and Grill. Parking is only on the street but it's usually free unless there's an event in town. \n\nVenue and Atmosphere \nThe restaurant is clean with simple but sleek decor, and the upstairs patio is nice. They have the obligatory grass wall, but what else is new.  \n\nService \nOur waitress was nice but she was a bit overwhelmed and rightfully so: she was the only server upstairs with 2 large tables plus our group of 5. Staffing seems to be an issue, but I understand why post COVID. Gratuity is included, of which I'm not a fan. \n\nFood and Beverages \nThe food could've been better. A LOT better. I had the brisket and my partner had pulled pork. Both were served lukewarm and flavor was severely lacking. The sauce did not help much. The collards were a bit too sweet. The mac and cheese was good, but overall they lost major stars with the food. The beverages were flavorful and strong, so that's a plus. \n\nVerdict \nWith all the great BBQ in Atlanta, the Mac and cheese isn't going to save this place.",

My party of 2 managed to get seated quickly. \n\nWe ordered short ribs and Caesar salad to start that was delicious. Food came out quickly. Monday - Friday there's happy hour until 8pm so the apps were only $5 each. \n\nFor our entrees we got the chose 2 platter and I got the brisket and pulled pork. Sides of mac and cheese and collard greens. My only gripe was you were only provided with forks which made it hard to tear the brisket apart. \n\nSuper delicious and a lot of food - we couldn't finish it all! Would come back.",

It was cold in Atlanta that day but it was warm up there.\n\nI'm happy they had a veggie combo because I was gonna just finesse something on the menu so I could eat it. \n\nMy food was good. I was surprised the vegetable medley wasn't like frozen California blend. The zucchini was grilled great and tasted good. The Mac and cheese was good as well. Also, I'm happy they made their greens without meat. The cornbread was dry. \n\nTwo negative things, well maybe 2.5 negative things.\n1) why is your employee smoking hookah while working? I know nobody was really up there but still it's unprofessional.\n\n2) I got charged wrong for a drink. All the specialty cocktails on the menu aren't the same price . The waitress did they were but I was too tired to argue with her . If the price is incorrect you need to update your site or tell the patrons after they scan the QR Code. (Nothing wrong with her service at all, she was great). \n\n3) 20% gratuity and they have to split it with everyone? I'm glad they listed it in the menu but people don't want to tip after that. \n\nOverall, may visit when I'm in town. Just depends.",

The first time I dined downstairs this time we went upstairs. Downstairs has club booth type seating with brighter lights while the upstairs patio has a wrap around bar, tables,booths and hookah. Yes bbq and hookah. \n\nThe fried shrimp is SOOOOO good and the only reason I want to go back the portions are getting smaller yet the food is getting pricier ($5 bottled water Im looking at you). When I came in May the drinks were served in normal cups, I dont mind paying extra for flavored lemonade but $5 (plus $2 refills) in a cocktail cup is type crazy. The food walks a fine line between being well seasoned and too salty. Service leaves a bit to be desired & gratuity is automatically included.  \n\nI say 3 stars my boyfriend says 2.5",

The greens were also very tasty. My daughter ordered the 4-bone pork ribs, and let me tell you the meat fell RIGHT off the bone. Perfect flavoring, I'd say they didn't even need bbq sauce.

                "text": "Well Tom, Dick & Hank was quite the disappoint. \n\nAfter I finished my work this morning near Downtown Atlanta, I decided to place a to go order at Tom, Dick & Hank. I was excited as this would be first time trying their BBQ and since I was nearby it would be a good lunch to take home. \n\nAt 11:45am, I went to place an order and found out I could only place it online. I went online to place an order and I could only place one at the College Park location. Disappointing as that was out of my way but I said oh well. Let me order. So I placed an order at 11:53am (yes at College Park, see attached photo) and drove 17 minutes there. \n\nI get there. Parked at a lot down the street. Walk over only to see a sign on the door that says we don't open until 1:00PM. \n\nI walk back to the car and call. But the number provided on the receipt didn't work. I called Toast Tab (the platform that they use for online orders), they couldn't help as they don't help customers. I called another number, no one answered. So I called the downtown location.  \n\nA man answers and he says they are open. I tell them they are not. So he calls and they say they don't have an order. And I'm like well I ordered. (At this point I really just wanted a refund which is what I said when he answered). Eventually he asks what I ordered, repeated it and said you can go get it. \n\nSo I walked back to the restaurant. And the girl says you placed it at downtown (wrong) and they are fixing it. \n\nSo now I DRIVE BACK the way I came wasting gas to get my meal. I get there and the man working there says they don't have my order. You sure you placed it at the right place. \n\nI tell him what happened. So he goes to back to ask for a rushed order. I truly appreciate the man at the bar who worked to make it right. He was the only helpful person. \n\nWhen I finally got home, it was 2:00PM. Almost 2 hours wasted. \n\nAnd the food was just ok. \n\nI will not return. Maybe the inside service is better. But ordering to go was a COMPLETE DISASTER.",

                "text": "TL;DR: Small spot with good BBQ and a casual vibe but super smokey inside. Great HH times and food/drink options.\n\nARRIVAL: I came here for lunch around 3 on a Friday. I live nearby so I walked here but there's a small parking lot that fits about 10 cars.\n\nAMBIANCE: I walked in and immediately saw and smelled the smoke in the place from the meat smoker (I assume). It's a very small restaurant downstairs where you enter with about 9 comfy half-booths and a bar with seating that was pretty full. I heard another guest mention 'upstairs' and they were told it was closed.\n\nMENU: The menu has the standard BBQ items and HH menu contains a variety of food that anyone would be able to enjoy.\n\nFOOD: We got the brisket plate with collard greens and mac and cheese, half dozen smoked wings, HH chicken tenders (last minutes switch because they were out of the rib tips). The brisket was about 5-6 slices and the fatty ones were SUPER tender and flavorful, but not too salty, a couple pieces were a little drier, but I wouldn't qualify them as inherently DRY. The collard greens do not have ham hocks (which is a plus for me) but were a tad on the salty side. The mac and cheese was good but i've had better from other places. The smoked wings had amazing flavor but were a bit on the dry side. This was my first time having smoked wings, so I'm not sure if that's normal and to be expected, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. They came with 3 flats and 3 drums which might have been an accident, but I was pleased by this as I'm a flat fanatic, so it was nice to see a balance at the least. The chicken tenders were definitely a smaller portion, but for $5 a great deal; think kids meal with 2 tenders and crinkle fries in a basket. They were crispy and lightly breaded, but the grease got them a bit soggy and they lost their crispiness. They could use a bit more seasoning.\n\nSERVICE: Service was attentive and casual = comfortable. Food didn't take long to come out. Keep in mind, they do add a service charge here on every bill!\n\nEXPERIENCE: Due to the area this place sits in and the fact that it's just about the only restaurant in the immediate vicinity, sometimes there are characters that walk in or are banging on the windows from outside. The staff seems to handle it well though.\n\nPRICE: Amazing for HH. The price for the regular plates are pretty standard, but I'd like to see the amount of meat match those in other bbq places with the same prices.\n\nOVERALL: I'll definitely try to make plans to return and try the turkey leg (which I came here for but forgot to order... womp womp). It's an easy decision based on the fact that you can fill up on HH plates alone if you wanted, but i'll have to warn friends of the smoke. Note: my hair, clothes, and even purse smelled like smoke for the rest of the day and even others could smell it on me unprompted!",

And I was pleasantly surprised! I really enjoyed the grilled catfish with collard greens and Mac and cheese. At first I wasn't sure the portions would be filling but they were and also tasty! The catfish had a nice char as well as a nice Smokey taste to it. While I waited at the bar to pick up my food, I saw some very tasty looking nachos and ribs pass by me en route to tables, so I am definitely interested in returning to dine in and check out more dishes! \n\nThe restaurant is a small intimate space that has some bar seating, banquet, and table seating. It has a laid back atmosphere; there are tv screens present for watching the next big game as well. \n\nMy order:  Fried (Grilled) Fish, Collard Greens, Mac and Cheese. About $14 + w/ tax; came to $16 and change with a tip.",

So we decided to just settle up on this restaurant after finding a parking. After we were seated upstairs I realized that there was a sign that stated that they automatically put 20% gratuity on the bill which I didn't think was too fair Along with the fact that this is the second restaurant in the city of Atlanta that did things this way. Either way we decided to order the food and our drinks.\n\nThey both came in a timely manner And was absolutely delicious. After finishing we just relax for a while because the music that they play it was great, it set the vibe beautifully and only continued from there. The waiter that we had was extremely respectful and gave us everything we requested. I would come back again, but it's 20% gratuity stuff Has to stop.",

She seemed as if she didn't want to be there from the time we walked in.... Meanwhile, I could count 2 hands on how many people that was there.\n\nThe hookah girl sat on her phone the entire time with her face balled up while letting her tables go under. We simply asked for more coal (in which it shouldn't be a request, it should simply be changed or asked if we need anything). She lack communication skills, and have a  low understanding of service.... yet, expect a 20% gratuity.  When I addressed my concerns, SHE LITERALLY WALKED AWAY. I've never seen anyone act this way in service. It's the rudest interaction I've ever had at a restaurant\n\nOnce I asked for a manager,  I realized he was the man sitting across the bar the entire time. His presence as a manager was not known nor did he step in to make sure the quality control of the restaurant was at its best. We stepped to the side to discuss the issue. While I expressed my concerns he LITERALLY called me aggressive for being direct about my service and the hookah girl. At one point he proceeded to walk away mid conversation. Clearly, he's in no position to be a manager. He's conflict resolution and communication is extremely LOW.\n\nMy group of people are /were paying customers that ordered and drank without an issue. We are not peons from the street and shouldn't have been treated as such.\n\nThe food was great, the view from the rooftop is amazing, I'll give credit where it's due. However, this experience completely ruin my night and my experience at TDH. It will be hard to ever patronize this business again. I've always thought and said nice things of this place but this was a disgusting interaction.\n\nReaders: please be aware of your choice to visit this place.\n\nHookah Girl: lace front with braces and a headband\n\nManager: Gentleman with locs\n\nThanks James, the bartender for making the best of the situation\n\nC.

                "text": "Have you ever heard of an 8 hour HAPPY HOUR??? \n\nWell if you haven't and need some libations to ease your frustrations, then swing by Tom, Dick & Hanks between noon & 8pm! They were another great find during my tour of Atlanta black-owned restaurants in honor of Black History Month. \n\nThe food here is legitimately good with a straightforward approach to all the meats and sides. They don't try to reinvent the wheel. Instead they stick to the staples with impressive quality as well as add a few items you might not expect. They also have a Hookah menu.\n\nDuring my visit I met councilman Antonio Lewis and his wife Ashley, who not only is a lawyer, but a foodie! She gave 6 additional restaurant recommendations I can't wait to try. Antonio loves Tom, Dick & Hanks so much that he says if you want to meet with him, it's most likely going to be here! \n\nHank was also featured on Atlanta Eats: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwN7T0Xc1mk&t=89s\n\n    [THE DETAILS ]\n\nDate & time: Thursday, January 13th, 2021 @ 2:15pm\nTime it took to receive order : 18 minutes\nBusiness level : low\nWhat to expect : Wood interior with booth & table seating + large bar\nParking: SMALL - tight fit for about 8 cars\n\nServer: Ksauna\nService: efficient & friendly\nOutdoor patio : rooftop\nAtmosphere : lively\nDress : casual\nHealth Score : 96 (A)\n\n    [ ENTRE\u00c9S ]\n\n4-Bone Rib Platter (5 stars) | $18\nEXCELLENT FLAVOR!!! These are the type of ribs that don't need sauce. As a matter of fact, they are so good sauce might actually be an insult. I ordered the mac n' cheese and collard greens as sides. The mac n' cheese is some of the best restaurant mac n' cheese I've ever tasted. The collard greens were also very good. \n\nSIDE NOTE: Originally ordered the combo plate, but I didn't care for the beef brisket (tough and dry). So they replace it with ribs to make it a rib plate instead. \n\n    [ FINAL THOUGHTS ]\n\nNow THIS is a place where I want to explore the ENTIRE menu. So many things I want to try like the smoked wings, turkey, seafood, turkey burger and those signature cocktails! I also love that they have a veggie plate, salads and sweets for my wife.\n\nI really enjoyed my meal! The pork ribs are flavorful, tender, smoky and delicious. Truly some of the best ribs I've had and that mac n' cheese is incredible!!! I was so impressed I came back a week later for seconds. The only complaint would be concerning the extremely limited parking situation, which I would forget all about after a few drinks during their extended happy hour! LOL\n\nTIP: A 20% service charge is added to all checks.\n\n2022 / 38\n\n#BlackOwnedBusinessSeries",

                "text": "I could give this place 0 Stars. I surely WOULD! This place food service was terrible, very horrible. I brought a family member there who just flew in and it was my birthday! The waitress was very rude, it took at least 30 minutes or more for her to bring us a cup of WATER over and on top of that she had a nasty attitude while doing so. Instead she attempted to attend to the other larger group table that already had a waitress who was actually better than ours with customer service. Our food was uncooked. Like we had fried fish and it was pretty dim lights on the rooftop so didn't really notice an issue with the food until we started eating and I grabbed my flashlight to put on the food. The fish was pink!! Like bloody. OMG and we had already eaten some of it.\n\n The waitress did not visit our table instead she continued to walk past us. We addressed the bartender to ask for the manager. The bartender was understanding and disappointed in the service experience. Instead of the manager coming, they sent their relative. He told us it was a family business and it wasn't much they could do. Then the hostile waitress comes over and tries to gaslight us as if we were the ones who pissed in her cereal. The bartender and other waitress stated we were not the hostile ones. But the hostile waitress started moving her hands in my guest and I face as we were SITTING and she was standing. We felt threatened and got up and she was addressed because that was a total boundary violation. The bouncer just laughed as the other concerned workers attempted to tell him it wasn't our faults. He told me and my guest we had to leave immediately. \n\nThe manager who never came out said they were too busy and wanted us out. The other tables agreed that the food service was horrible as well. And these were GROUPS of people. After the incident many decided to leave and complain about the service as well. We will never come back here!!!! Very rude, classless, poor food safety, and safety hazard",

Now, they'll be a lounge that doesn't allow substitutions, only serves $4 water, and no BBQ/Smoked food. WHY... So I guess it means bon voyage to a popular spot for us and we wish them well on their new venture.",

Pork ribs, smoked wings, Mac & cheese, beans, greens and corn bread phenomenal. Do not get the brisket, it's not good, I would recommend they save money on a brisket and don't make it anymore. If someone got just that, they would have left unhappy. The rest of the food, fantastic. \n\nDefinitely would recommend this place.",

But the collards and cornbread were top notch.\n\nAll of our food was hot and came out within 15 minutes of ordering.  Our server was attentive and available.\n\nOur food came out of plates, but the utensils were plastic.  Considering we are still in the midst of a pandemic and there are labor shortages, plastic silverware cuts back on dishwashing...so I get it...\n\nFinally, Main Street has a decent amount of free public street parking.  Since I dined mid-week as the weather was getting cold there was plenty of parking.  But on weekends and busier nights you may have to circle a few times to get a spot.",

When we went in you had to go upstairs for the balcony, it was OK they accommodate groups but it will be a wait if you want to sit with your group because it is small on the roof. The music was good they had a DJ there as well. I ordered a quarter leg chicken platter with mac & cheese collard greens and cornbread. The cornbread was very cold but it did have a good flavor to it. The collard greens were OK tasted like it was out of a can. The mac & cheese was a little salty but the chicken was delicious. I have been trying to find good sweet tea in Georgia while I was there visiting and this place has the best sweet tea I taste it going to a restaurant. Our waiter he was OK but I wish he was more attentive to the table because we had to ask other people for things. To be honest I probably would go back to this place for the chicken and sweet tea",
