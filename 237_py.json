But it's been so long I wouldn't do this review justice trying to recall. What I will say is that I gave it 4/5 which means I enjoyed the food and drinks it and I'll probs go back one day (though it's already been 3.5 years lol).",

Most places you can't get a Cuban, but this was beyond unlike anything I've ever tried before. The chicken was grilled to perfection. Rice was perfect as well as the beans. We also started with the salsa and queso. Salsa was really good and freshly made but the starve the appetizers was the queso. Top three queso I've ever had maybe the best. I am literally salivating writing this review. This place is darn near worth a flight.",

The restaurant is very clean. \n\nService \nThe employees are kind and efficient, and took our orders promptly. \n\nFood and Beverages \nI always order the Cuban sandwich, and it never disappoints. I tried their tortilla soup this time; it was flavorful and topped with cheese which was a nice touch. Their chips and salsa are house made and some of the best in ATL. \n\nVerdict \nIf I'm craving a Cuban sandwich I'll be back!",

Needless to say, it did not disappoint. While some bad weather made it so we couldn't sit on the rooftop patio, everything about the indoor experience was spectacular.\n\nThe service was prompt and friendly, and the food was delicious. I got the enchiladas while the boyfriend got the burrito, and both were great. While the food prices aren't super cheap, they make up for it with the drinks. We got the specialty frozen marg half pitcher for only $15, and it was 1) great tasting and 2) strong. A perfect combo, really.\n\nThe chips and salsa were also to die for. I think it might be the first time I've eaten at a Latin place where the chips and salsa genuinely felt high quality. All in all, I really enjoyed La Fonda and I'm excited to come back!",

Not sure what I've done in life to deserve this luxury, but the server kept refilling our table with bowl after bowl of hot chips directly from the oven, which came with free salsa.

                "text": "Good food served at a breakneck speed. \n\nLa Fonda enjoys a nice two story space and they utilize the space well enough. The outdoor seating on the main level is plenty. There is an expansive indoor ground level. The upstairs outdoor seating is both covered, coveted, and small. I felt that I was lucky to grab a table for two outside on a warm spring night (5/26/23). \n\nI did literally have to grab the table. La Fonda is a first come first serve restaurant and La Fonda does not (or at least did not) employ the use of a host. Despite the lack of a host, I did certainly feel seen. Before I could even sit down my table was greeted with chips and salsa. The stealth from La Fonda's staff was my hint that I wasn't so lucky after all to find the table outside. La Fonda wants to get the diner in and out as quickly as possible. This speedy business model became most apparent when my table received our drinks and food at the exact same time (about 7 minutes after ordering). I really do not like receiving my cocktail and meal together. I want to slow down and enjoy myself and my company. I have nowhere else I want to be. \n\nThe food at La Fonda proves their crowd. I appreciate that La Fonda has various paella dishes on their menu. For me, ordering paella perfectly sums up the whole concept of \"going out to eat so that you can try food you wouldn't normally cook at home\" spiel. I ordered the \"paella for one\" and the meal was precise to the description. The rice was lip smacking and every bite had great flavor that popped. The fish tacos were also good and spicy. \n\nThe drink menu distracted me throughout my meal. The front cover of the drink menu features a print warning: \"Special Orders and Drinks Made Correctly Are Non-Refundable.\" I understand that customers can be annoying and needy; but customer needs are part of the territory. No matter how wrong the customer may be they do still have agency and they are probably good people. Customers dine out so that they can eat something that they would not normally cook at home and so that they can be waited on. Customers want to be cared for. \n\nRestaurants have an ability to become part of the community and to offer a dining experience. Restaurants can love their community just as much as their community loves them. La Fonda's drink menu warning suggests that La Fonda is not interested in their customers' desire for a dining experience. The rushed pace at La Fonda combined with the Drink Menu Warning made me feel un-welcomed and uncared for; as if I'm just someone in La Fonda's way. I cannot change my opinion. After all, all of my correct opinions cannot be unchanged.",

We ordered the sangrita for a drink, which was a mix of frozen margarita and red sangria; SO good. So good, they could be dangerous.\n\nFor food we ordered the paella which was hot, fresh, and tested amazing. There was a very generous portion for two and a reasonable price. We also ordered the churros which were yummy but could've had a better ratio of cinnamon in their cinnamon sugar. \n\ndespite the great food and view, my silverware had dried beans on them, so I needed to wait for replacements, and the server brought our bill without asking if we wanted dessert, which made me feel a little rushed when I asked if we could in fact get the churros.\n\nDespite this, we had a nice experience and I'll come back for the sangrita and paella",

I got the paella and my friend got the chorizo cubano and both my friend's dish and mine were extremely salty. I really wanted to like the paella but it simply was not good and despite all the salt and meat, tasted almost bland. \n\nI think they had a good drink selection for cheap prices which is something I would come back here for, but if you're really hungry, maybe not the place to go for good food. \n\nThe service was also just not the best. It was mediocre at best as well.\n\nThe good side to this place is that there is not hassle with parking, but other than that not a big fan to be honest. \n\nWhile I may not have enjoyed this place, you never know if you'll like it unless you try!",

The salmon burrito is also a favorite. \nA while back, I ordered the seafood paella and there was a scarce amount of seafood. I do not recommend that dish, especially considering the price.\nThey make good horchata. It's a little on the sweet side but that is typically the case.\n\nService-\nNot once have we had an experience here where our server was not attentive or the food did not come out fast. We have never had a wait at this location, either. It is good to know that they do not accept reservations here. It is a first come first serve basis. \n\nAmbiance- \nI always sit on the rooftop when I can. There are plenty of fans and heaters for all sorts of weather. Downstairs are wooden booths and tables.\nWe always feel welcomed when we dine here. A great choice for authentic Cuban food!",

Meal starts off with complimentary chips and salsa with an assortment of different sauces to add on. The menu is pretty large, so definitely worth coming back to try different items. I tried the steak torta which I thought was fantastic. It had some sort of aioli within it that really brought together the dish. Tried some of my friends paella and thought this was another very well made dish.",

The music is still a bit too loud but does drown out the obnoxious people, who always want you to every word of their conversations. Not the restaurant's fault at all. I ordered the same pressed ham and pork sandwich I had so long ago and couldn't even finish it, perfect leftover meal for later. I look forward to my next visit.",

The yellow rice with black beans were a lot better than last time (they used to much cumin) my wife's food was more presentation than flavor yet safe to say it's edible. The service was satisfactory at best and the place was a bit noisy mixed with the loud music it makes it hard to have a conversation. I guess you can say, it's one of those spots you have to try for yourself!",

Paella - without shrimp \nI loved the flavors of this Spanish dish! I never heard this before and now I want to have it all the time. It was very delicious \n2. Tostones \nI wasn't a fan of their tostones. The inside was very soft and felt uncooked. Wouldn't recommend \n3. Beef Enchiladas \nThis was also very delicious and filling. The tortilla is made from corn ( yum yum ). \n\nEnjoy ;)",

                "text": "The food at La Fonda is just another representation of pretty much all the food in and around downtown Atlanta- touristy, popular, but average quality in terms of the taste. First, the inside need central AC. It is definitely not comfortable dining during the heat of the summer. I do appreciate the fact that they have rooftop seating, but it did not help with the heat either. Tried to cool down with some coke only to realize they serve cans as opposed to fountain. I savored my single can of coke strategically, balancing it out between cooling myself down and pairing with the food later. \n\nNow onto the food. We ordered chips and guacamole. Solid guac, I have nothing to say about it. The guac tasted fresh, but it would be nice to have a taste of lime since the acidity usually goes really well with the savory of the guac. That being said, the absence of lime was not a deal breaker for me. I ordered the shrimp taco, which came with rice and beans. I have to say, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. The price was about $11 for the dish, which was very reasonable. The shrimp taco tasted very bland and the smokiness of the shrimp was very weak. The rice and beans... well, it's just rice and beans. I can probably make that using the ingredients from Publix and still have it taste the same. \n\nParking can be difficult to find. Street parking is your best bet. \n\nOverall, food wasn't bad, but there were no \"wow\" factors either. Would definitely recommend driving out for more authentic Mexican food.",

So I went with the cheese enchiladas and I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all. It tasted amazing. The food came out quickly. I ordered a prickly pear margarita. It had great flavor but wasn't enough alcohol as I didn't feel anything and I'm a light weight. The bathroom smelled nice and it was Farley clean but usable. I would definitely come back for a visit. Just wish I had the option not to have mushroom in the vegetarian options.",

Like the prices are fine for the amount of food you get. They could've done so much better with the Cuban-Mexican fusion, like having white rice for cuban dishes and the yellow rice for mexican ones, but its only yellow rice. The rice is good, but it takes away from the beans and the ropa vieja when you eat them together. The tostones are overpriced, specially since they taste like the frozen ones. Overall nice, fast, and really good service, plus location is pretty and has a nice view.",

It was very fresh and had a great kick to it. I appreciated that it was complimentary and refilled as needed. The service was prompt and the staff was friendly.

For this to be \"Latin\" food, they fail to give authenticity to any of the dishes lol. \n\nThere's a tall guy that works here and he is rude and unhelpful. I'd hate to throw out the racist card, but he's friendly to lighter folks and unresponsive if you're his color or darker. To the point where he doesn't speak when he first comes to the table, just asks what you want. no greeting. We speak to him and he ignores it. If you say thank you to him, he doesn't reply. No joke. I've experienced multiple times. \n\nThe saddest part, one time a homeless, drunk man was bothering people on the patio and the racist employee came outside to ask the man to leave. The drunk man then cussed the employee out and started harassing the guests. My husband gets up and makes the guy leave. Do you think that was acknowledged? No! My husband stopped the paying guests from being harassed and stops the employee from being cussed out. No thank you, no discount, nothing! Came back a few nights later, guy was still ignoring us. We should have minded our own business and let him continue to be humiliated in front of the guests. \n\nMaybe it's this location, but the staff is consistently ruins the experience.",

You also get chips and salsa at the table (chips can get refilled) so it was a great time overall. \n\nService was friendly and pretty quick.

I could never understand how they sit people - it's first come first serve but people can jump in line if there's an empty table for 2 and there are 2 people waiting to be seated. Once you get seated though, everything goes pretty smoothly. Service is a hit or miss but I think food is good for the price. I usually get paella when I'm here but this time I got the grilled salmons plate with rice and beans. Fish was grilled to perfection and not dry.",
