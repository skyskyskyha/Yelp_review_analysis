It had such great flavor with a hint of heat! It was very fulfilling.\n\nCant lie, inside is small and the lines are long! But since driving 45mins I had to stay and see whats up. But i didn't wait long, i think i got through pretty quickly and i did get a juice from there not pictured but it was handmade and was really good.\n\nIm not vegan but i love a good taste and new healthy options here and there. The parking is a bit tight, you can either park on the side of the building or across the street in the little parking lot. Definitely worth a try",

I arrived to the place 5 minutes after my pick up time and I'm still waiting for a wrap that has 4 ingredients for 30 more minutes. \nIt's ridiculous.  \nThere is no reason it should take 90 minutes to fix a wrap. \nIf you have 90 minutes to 2 hours to wait I recommend it but if you don't have patience just go somewhere else.",

He's been bragging about how good their wraps are on his instagram so I was like if I ever go to Atlanta I want to try it and I did. I'm glad I did. The food creations there are so healthy, flavorful and creative. I loved my wrap. I got the punany with spicy kale. I accidentally got a full and when they say a full, it's a full! Like it will feed you for 2 days type of full. I kinda thought $20 was expensive but it's not. It's going to take me 2 days to finish the wrap and I'm typically greedy. Lol. I felt energized after eating the wrap. It was healing. Wish I had a place like this in Miami. The staff are so sweet and friendly. I also like how the restaurant is set up in what seems like a old home. The parking is also convenient. Luckily for me the line wasn't long. It's just all around creative and I enjoyed my meal.

I usually get the full size wrap and have half for lunch and the other half for dinner. \n\nThe customer service here is solid in my experience, but I highly recommend ordering in advance to avoid a long wait (due to the high volume of customers and advance orders they get at the restaurant). They also have limited space since it's mostly grab and go. So, it could get a little uncomfortable (and awkward) if you end up having to wait for your order on their front porch in one of Atlanta's less than ideal weather conditions: humidity, rain, thunderstorms, etc. That's at least what I heard from a friend because I definitely didn't get caught in the rain after being dropped off by a Lyft driver in full on business attire.

The kale was a bit bulky, could probably do without the stems. The brownie was a nice way to bring this meal together. 4 stars because It was a little too spicy for me, but if you like spice, I can see this being 5 stars. Service was great.

Be mindful that because this is a raw foods restaurant the stew is served cold. Both the wrap and stew were seasoned well and were delicious. I opted for the gluten free option for the wrap which just means it's wrapped in seaweed... be prepared to get messy. There is limited street parking and a few tables outside. Friendly and made to order service.",

The owner came out and said maybe you could pick something from the refrigerator. I said we are from New York and would love to try out the wraps. She said let me check and agreed to make it for us. We ordered 4 south of the border wrap half each though it was a big portion size. We asked them for extra corn and they forgot to add it. But while we were eating our dinner outside they came out and gave it to us after almost an hour which was very sweet. The wrap and the corn everything tasted so good. We could only eat half of the half size and we were full. I ate the remaining portion for the next day's breakfast. \n\nThe space outside we were eating our dinner was pretty relaxing with a beautiful garden.",

I've heard nothing but amazing things about this restaurant and had to finally check it out myself. Being an Atlanta native, I didn't get to indulge in the vegan scene until recent because I live elsewhere but this place did NOT miss!!!! Staff is lovely, quick on the go meals. Their raw food does leave out any flavor! So fresh & well seasoned. I got the full size wrap to save for later and the Punany tasted sooooooo yummy. I was jumping for joy inside & had to have major self control to not eat the whole thing! Even tried out some of their fresh juices (tamarind & berry lemonade) & they were very refreshing. I honestly wish there were more Tassili's in every single state because everyone deserves to experience this cuisine! Hands down best vegan spot in Atlanta.",

The taste is delicious and highly nutritious. They use fresh quality ingredients and they put a lot of quality and care into the preparation of their food. Their portions are also very large. \n\nI enjoy their Mandingo wrap. It is massive! Their South of the Border wrap is delicious also and if you are fan of mushrooms then you must give the Dat ISH wrap a try. \n\nI know many complain about the wait times however when I visited during the week in the afternoon. There was no wait and I was able to quickly place my order. Employees were very friendly and it was nice to be back here and support this place. Will definitely return again soon!",

There will be a line when you go just make sure to have patience because the food is well worth it! I had the punany which came with kale I got it mixed with mild and spicy, coconut corn tomatoes couscous and some other things. It was delicious!\n\nThe meal is similar to when you go to a Subway or Jersey Mike's for instance they  fixed your food right in front of you so you get to pick all the topics you want. They also let you taste whatever you want to see if you want it on your wrap. I also saw that they sell soups as well and I really wanted to try some so I will be going back to try that as well.\n\nThe reason for the four stars instead of five is because there is no place to sit but that's not a deal breaker for me I don't mind getting my food and going back home. Other than that great service and friendly employees. I highly recommend it!",

This restaurant specializes in vegan wraps that are succulently delicious. The wraps are healthy, with such fookale , cauliflower, okra, corn, and much more. One can get mild or spicy sauce, depending on their taste buds. The ambiance is great and welcoming. The staff is friendly and the wait is not long. If you are in Atlanta and seeking a healthy, tasty meal, I recommend this restaurant.",

Today I placed my order at 9:30am in hopes that it would be ready when it opened. I didn't get my food until 12:40pm. I can't sit by and continue to be upset every time I come pay my money to a business that can't seem to get it together. \nAnd you forgot my Raw Bq sauce...",

You were here way before me!\". And she was 100% right. If you have 2 hours to kill, sure check this place out. Otherwise, don't expect a single staff member to make sure you're taken care of. We were checking in on our order every 15 minutes and it still took an hour. I understand if you're short staffed- but maybe don't take online orders if you simply can't make it happen.",

                "text": "I write this post with love. I love supporting black owned businesses--especially when they provide a great service. I drive about 20+ minutes from my house to Tassili's, and it's always a toss up whether I'll end up leaving with food or not. Sometimes I show up and it's complete chaos. Sometimes they're so busy they they don't accept walk in orders, so you have to place your order online, which yields about a TWO HOUR wait!!  Even then, there's still no guarantee that your raw food will be ready! \n\nI'm currently in the restaurant as I write this review. I've been standing in line for OVER an hour at this point. Don't get me wrong--the food is delicious, but this is ridiculous!! \n\nThe building is super old and in need of a complete renovation! There is a hole in the bathroom floor and the floor in the ordering area looks like it can implode any day now! The window unit needs to be replaced. The business is bursting at its seams--literally. I'm also concerned about the overuse of plastic wrap. When you cut into the wrap, what happens to the plastic you're cutting into? Does it go into the food we're consuming? As a health conscious restaurant, it seems like they would steer away from using plastic so much. Paper products are biodegradable and healthier to use versus flooding our bodies with micro plastics. \n\nWhen will Ms. Tassili expand the business? Why does it take so long to make raw wraps?! How about investing in your business, expanding the business, opening a second line or a second location?? Don't just bank on customers coming back because the food IS good. What about the customer's time? It shouldn't take 3 hours of my time (be it ordering ahead or walking in to order) for me to get some food! This isn't a rant. It's a recommendation. Please invest in your business with all the sales from dedicated customers and expand. It's time. \n\nBtw--I ended up getting my food two hours later. As I left, the line was out to the road. Smh",

Honestly though, the wait time wasn't as much of an issue as the fact that the service was actually garbage. Everyone working there had this disposition like they hated being there and also hated you for being there. Also, not to mention, the inside of the store in and of itself left me wondering where the health score was. Definitely not very well kept or clean. All that for a.... Kale wrap? Lmao. I could have went to Kroger, bought all the ingredients, and made one just as good in that amount of time. The ONLY reason this is getting a second star is because the food was ~okay~ but not worth it at all.",

I have tried to save the money and recreate it at home but it never comes out the same. There are dupe recipes that are good but none compare to the original. Go. Try. It. Now. There is no seating and you can save yourself time by ordering ahead on Uber eats. Kind of pricey but very worth it. If they had a meal prep plan I would purchase it and let them prepare my meals for the week (manifesting here).",

                "text": "This morning (May 17, 2023) I came to Tassili's with my mother on the way to the airport. She is from Hawaii and wanted to grab a wrap before she got on her flight. We got there early (about 10:40) and were the 5th customers in line. \n\nTassili's is supposed to open at 11 every morning however, this morning they opened late (11:10). While I was in line waiting on them to open, I called the store to literally ask them \"WHY AREN'T YOU OPEN YET? AND WHY HAVEN'T YOU ADDRESSED THIS LINE OF CUSTOMERS WAITING OUTSIDE?!\"...but no answer smh... When they finally open, they did not engage with any of the customers to apologize for our time wasted and their lack of professionalism.\n\nMy mother and I decided to go ahead and stay to order our food (because the 2 gentlemen in front of us left) even though at this point we are now 10 minutes behind for the airport. We end up getting to the counter to order our food only to find out (now being the 3rd customers in line) that they are already on a 30 to 35 minute wait!!!?\n\nNow let me get this straight...this is a raw food establishment and y'all are on a 30 to 35 minute wait after we've already waited 10 minutes to get in here? How?? It do not take 30 to 35 minutes to put RAW FOOD in a spinach wrap and roll it up. Y'all fronting for reall! The food here is good but nah....ain't no way yall out here playing with people's time to create some fa\u00e7ade of demand. Ain't no way it takes LONGER to get RAW FOOD than it does going to a restaurant that actually cooks food! Straight cap. Y'all know this stuff is already prepped from that morning or the day before. And if it's not...there's your problem right there...\n\nI'll never spend my money at this establishment again. We ended up leaving because we didn't have the time to sit there and wait 30 to 35 minutes. This business does not have any customer service training at all. The people that spend money here deserve better.\n\nDid I mention that I live in Buford, GA so I'm a whole hour away from this place!? My family does not live in Georgia and every time they visit they request food from Tassili's. Today, y'all lost 8 customers. We ain't coming back...\n\nLiterally this is the worst experience I've ever had with a restaurant. I've never left a review in my life but I called to get some customer service and the voicemail is full. Smh...",

We showed up not long after Tassili's opened, only to be told that they were not taking walk-in orders ~ we needed to order online. We saw all sorts of people standing around waiting, so we asked how long it would take to get our order. The person told us, \"I don't know, just order your food and it will tell you how long.\" Then the owner came out and told us it would be at least 45 minutes. So, stand around in the noon-day heat for 45 minutes to get RAW food? And why couldn't we place an order in person? Forget it. The owner didn't care that we, along with the other half-dozen people who found out they couldn't order in person, decided to go elsewhere.

Its just tiring.\n\n\nThe wait is long enough in addition to fight traffic (I mean it's Atlanta) and for it to be wrong the wait for correction is astronomical (you've already waited an hour or more) and there's no other real options of real resolution as emails go unanswered.\n\nThis is the third incident and again nothing on this menu is \"fast food\" priced, there should be a level of service that accompanies the quality of food being served. \n\nThe customer support and care is lacking. \n\nWhen it's right it's good but when it's wrong it's literally nasty as it's not what you ordered or eat.",

The Big Yoshi - Chili Wrap was stuffed with a lot of pad thai, some spicy kale, and creamy avocado. This definitely had heat! It was good, but I liked the Punany Spinach Wrap more- it was packed full of that amazing spicy kale salad, couscous, sweet corn, tomatoes, and avocado. This was amazing! Would definitely order again- maybe try it with the seaweed wrap? The tortilla style wrap was fine in the fridge overnight and still fresh for lunch the next day. IDK if seaweed would survive that. It looked like they had desserts on their website but when I ordered via Uber eats it wasn't an option... bummer, they looked good.",
