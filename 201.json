        "text": "I had gotten a giftcard for my birthday to spend at a Fifth Group restaurant, so we decided to check out Ecco! We made a reservation for a Friday evening and were seated pretty much immediately. There's parking along Cypress that's pretty easy through ParkMobile. \n\nThe restaurant has such a cool vibe inside and is super intimate and cozy. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and decided to order everything family-style. Our waiter was super helpful with recommendations. We got the charcuterie board, fried goat cheese balls, the speck flatbread, agnolotti, patatas bravas, and spaghetti al Nero. The fried goat cheese balls lived up to the hype and were absolutely the highlight of the meal!! The rest of the food was absolutely delicious and the perfect portions for 4 people to share. \n\nOverall, really cool dinner spot and really great food! Would definitely recommend for a special occasion.",

        "text": "Ate here with a large party, so please consider my review in that context.\n\nApps - charcuterie board (very good!), chicory (I think?) salad (delicious), speck flatbread (great but difficult to eat, not for dates or a business dinner. It was very crisp, not well cut, making it hard to get the pieces apart and the speck was in big slices that fell off to the side or were hard to bite through gracefully).\n\nCocktails and wine were all delicious and with creative ingredients and names. Even the mocktails had rave reviews from our party.\n\nI had the agnolotti as a main, which was vegetarian and really flavorful. the only issue was it arrived cold and with very different amounts of sauce for each person who ordered it. Our server was apologetic and took several plates away to get rewarmed. Service overall was stellar.\n\nWould definitely give this place another go with a smaller group.",

The serving was generous and the food was very fresh. \nOur server was knowledgeable and kind, however, I am knocking off 1 star because we tried to pay with a giftcard but it somehow didn't work? Our server then kept the card and we had to ask for it back.. We initially thought it was then a faulty card due to this, but after looking up the details, realized that the card was perfectly fine. It was just sort of an odd experience in that sense, but the dining was good.",

        "text": "Came to eat dinner with the family on a random Thursday night for the first time and we were so pleased from start to finish! Called in to find out about the dress code and the hostess answered all my questions. Was able to make a reservation over the phone. Very pleasant staff. Our waiter  , michael McGill was so knowledgeable about everything on the menu! We LOVE when a waiter can guide us through a new restaurant experience! We ordered a great bottle of white wine - Picpoul de Pinet, which he recommended and we loved it! \n\nFor our appetizer we ordered the lamb meatballs - OMG. So full of flavor and the garnishes gave a lot of great texture as well. We received bread service with oil on the side. The bread was warm and great but I wish the oil had some herbs or spices in it for dipping. For our entrees we ordered the duck and the sea bass. The duck was ordered medium well because we don't like any redness in our meat. It was so delicious, tender and just amazing! The cauliflower was also great in that dish. The sea bass was seasoned very well and was served with fingerling potatoes - very delicious. For dessert we ordered the baklava that was served over a cheesecake sauce with lemon sorbet on top and pistachios. Literally life changing! You have to try it! \n\nMy 5 year old daughter was with us and we were able to order a flatbread cheese pizza. She is extremely picky and didn't eat much of it because it doesn't look like the typical pizza slices that she's accustomed to. She did enjoy pulling the mozzarella off the top and eating it. We ordered a side of fries and we all loved them. They came out hot!\n\nMike explained that the buckhead location has a similar vibe but an entirely different menu. We are excited to try that one! We signed up for the rewards system also.",

        "text": "This was probably the best dinner we had on our business trip to Atlanta.   One of the reasons it was so good was because so done else was paying.  But don't worry, it is worth the trip.\n\nParking, we Ubered, so I don't really know.  Sorry.\n\nService, it is loud and we had a large group so hearing us might have been a problem, but it wasn't.  Service was exceptional.\n\nThe food:\nFried Goat Cheese - AMAZING dish, get it even if you don't like goat cheese.  The honey sauce pairs so well.\nGrilled Octopus - this was also amazing, but we shared it. I could eat one by myself.\nHeirloom Tomato Salad - fresh, refreshing.\nBroccolini - chard, we'll prepared but not my favorite (side to Swordfish)\nPappardelle - wonderful pasta choice, good size dish.\nSwordfish - buttery texture and cut like bread.  This was so moist and flavorful.\nMussels - solid choice but a lot of work to get to the good stuff.\nCrispy Duck - Phenomenal, period.  Best dish of the night.\nCheesecake - decadent, good not great.\nWine list - phenomenal.\n\nPortions are light, so you do t have to save room for dessert.\n\nTips:\n- Maker sure you go on their website and make reservations.\n- Order the fried goat cheese, there are five pieces to share.\n- Try the grilled squid, if you like it, because they do it right.\n- Dessert was not a strong suit, choose an after dinner drink.\n- Want to SPLURGE, go for the wine list and ask for suggestions.  They will help you pair the perfect wine with your food choices.",

        "text": "Placed a pickup order at 7:18 pm on Friday. I ordered the pommes frites and the dinner for two braised pork pappardelle. The order was set to be ready at 8 pm. I get there at 8 pm to pickup my order and the hostess asks for my name and I give it to her. She comes back and says nothing to me and cleans menus. She cleans menus for several minutes without even talking to me again or communicating about the status of my order. I ask her when she thinks my order will be ready and she says \"no idea. I would cook it if I could.\" Finally a man, whom I can only assume to be the manager, inquired and helped me. I got the order at 8:15 pm and I got back home at 8:17 pm since it's a quick walk away. \n\nThe dinner for two was missing the salad it was supposed to come with and the fries were missing the aioli. The pasta was fresh and hot and quite delicious. The noodles had a great bite to them. The braised meat was succulent and tender. The sauce was balanced and well flavored. The fries were a bit mushy so I assume they'd been sitting a bit longer waiting for the pasta. The bread was nice. It was crusty but had a soft interior. \n\nOverall, the level of service was mediocre especially with the prices they were charging. It's also a bit disheartening when they don't pack the items they advertise in their menus. I wouldn't recommend this place despite the tasty pasta I ate.",

The \"nice\" hostess said the bar is first come first serve... but what about a table for two...\nWe ordered grilled octopus and wood roasted mussels with frites. The octopus which was much smaller than expected came out about 5 minutes later followed by the mussels. The salsa verde was aight with the octopus, maybe something spicer would've made it better. The nduja \"spicy sausage\" gave the mussels a great taste! And the frites were not bad. \nI had the seared swordfish which was not bad but was terrible with the very bitter rapini. \nThe black pepper rigatoni was a very healthy pasta choice and it was much better than the swordfish. \nService at the bar was good, but there were several loud tables with squeaky laughs here and there.",

        "text": "Food was good, but I am not as enamored with this restaurant as other reviewers. Piquillo pepper appetizer was good, but it's basically four bites of smoked beef stuffed into a very small pepper - but it was tasty. Mixed lettuce salad  was good, but very small portion of just lettuce and radishes for the $13 price tag. Flatbread was okay, but in my opinion, nothing special. Friend loves the pappardelle, and I had the duck, 2 small strips for $40, which is overpriced. The duck was initially served undercooked, raw, and when it was re-cooked and returned to me, for some unknown reason, it was placed on an appetizer size plate Instead of the original serving dish. I thought that was kind of strange. Wines are pricey for the quality, and desserts were only ok in my opinion, not very appealing. At 7 pm on a Friday, they were out of 3 items..... Service was excellent, including hostess - our server was very knowledgeable, pleasant, and attentive.",

Fantastic appetizer! \n\nWe had a reservation for five, which we called and switched to four, then called again and switched it back to five and they were SO accommodating. Their cocktail menu is also fun... my two friends got the Long Live the Queen, to honor Queen Elizabeth II after her passing this week. I got the Georgia Caipirinha, which tasted good. Not exactly like the Brazilian Caipirinha's I've had but it IS the Georgia Caipirinha, after all.\n\nOur server asked if we'd like bread and we said yes (always say yes to bread). He didn't let us know that we'd have to pay for it and brought us two bread baskets. I wish he had told us, but the two baskets split five ways wasn't expensive. He was a great server, though. \n\nMy friend liked her sword fish and I enjoyed the pappardelle. It was pretty tasty. Lots of vegetarian and pescatarian options if you have dietary restrictions.",

        "text": "We had a lovely experience sitting on the patio with friends on a Saturday night. The service was wonderful - our waiter was great, and we got to chat with the GM for a bit, too. I understand the hype for the goat cheese balls - they were unlike any I've tasted before with a thin, crispy shell - very delicate! We also split a mushroom flatbread, the chickpea starter, and the octopus, which were tasty as well. I'd say the flatbread was my favorite. We all had pasta for our entree, and I loved the rigatoni that came with a smoky red sauce - the noodles were the perfect al dente... chewy and irresistible. We had a streudel with gelato for dessert, and I would probably pass on that, but that's more of a me problem. I'm more of a cake/chocolate dessert girl. Would definitely come back here for a nice evening out.",

        "text": "What a great date night spot near the heart of Midtown!  We've been here a handful of times and plan to keep coming back. The restaurant has beautiful decor and provides a kind of dark and moody setting for dinner, it feels very upscale and intimate. \n\nParking: they have valet available, but there is a lot right across the street that you can park at as well (I believe you pay at the meter). There's also limited street parking available. \n\nI'd recommend making a reservation before coming, they do allow walk-in service but it can get very busy on nights/weekends. \n\nThe service was A+ perfect, our waitress was so friendly and took the time to explain the different menu options and help us narrow down our final selections. \n\nFor an appetizer, if you come here and don't get the Fried Goat Cheese then you 10000% messed up. You HAVE to order this!! I'll be honest, I'm very hit or miss with goat cheese because I don't like overly pungent cheeses....they use a very mild goat cheese for this appetizer and it has just enough bite, paired perfectly with a drizzle of sweet honey. I could eat bowls full of this stuff! \n\nBased on our servers recommendations, we went with the Black Truffle Risotto and the special Crab Spaghetti. Per her recommendation, she said the risotto was delicious flavor wise but a slightly smaller dish, so she mentioned that \"if we were hungry to get the spaghetti\" - maybe I overthought it but I was expecting a bowl of spaghetti, but what came out was a very reasonable sized dish. I was hoping for $40 you'd get a little more, but it was still a decent portion. The Crab Spaghetti had delicious flavors, my only complaint was that the pasta was cooked Al dente to a fault....I felt like the pasta \"bit back\" a little too much and needed to be cooked maybe a minute longer. The crab was so delicate and not at all fishy. I do agree that the risotto was a delicious and flavorful dish - I felt like the dish could have done without the citrus, the flavors didn't necessarily pair so well together where I felt like it brought the dish together....again, this is coming from an untrained foodie so take that with a grain of salt. \n\nMy big hang up is they took pinot noir off the menu by the glass!!  they have a burgundy on the menu that has a similar profile, but I was so bummed to see that it wasn't available by the glass anymore. I also think the dishes are a tad pricey for what you get. \n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend Ecco for a nice date night experience!",

I watched the slow morning lunch end and roll into dinner and they attended all customers very well given a natural instinct when coming in is to sit over at their large bar while waiting on remaining parties or if you're a single seater. I also while I sat here awhile on my own watched a few customers walk in having no knowledge of the place be a bit disrespectful with the tenders. I personally decided to leave this review purely based off the grace of Sara respectfully communicating with the customer and that's why I'm here. Go Sara and I'm sure on weekends in this busy downtown area she's a favorite even though this is my first time at Ecco.",

I had not been for several years, so I was hoping the food and service was just as good during the pandemic.\n\nI love the ambiance. The restaurant has a sexy vibe and an open kitchen layout, perfect for a date night. \n\nThe draw here is the fried goat cheese appetizer. Drizzled with honey and topped with fresh cracked pepper, it was even better than I remembered. I could easily eat a dozen of those things. \n\nI was sad to see their scallops weren't on the menu. I settled for the pork blade steak. Topped with whole wheat focaccia, that served as croutons, it was also topped with roasted tomatoes, arugula, frisée and a smoked tomato vinaigrette which was delicious! The pork blade steak was grilled a little too hard for my liking, where I could taste the char. The portion size was good however.\n\nI had a side of pommes frites (French fries) which were seasoned and cooked well. They pair it with a sherry garlic aioli sauce that is divine.\n\nFor the drink I had the Bring Me The Shrubbery cocktail which consisted of Finlandia vodka, strawberry-basil shrub, soda and basil. It was a refreshing mix of flavors so good, I ordered two. \n\nThe service is always excellent. The manager always comes over to check on each patron and all the servers always greet you and smile (they are all masked so the smile is assumed).\n\nDefinitely stays on my favorite list. Just bring back the scallops!",

        "text": "I wasn't expecting much given that it was nearing 10pm on a Friday night and we were just coming for dessert/drinks/light bites, but we left impressed!\n\n++ Mussels appetizer. We got this as a light bite, but the portion is actually pretty hefty, and with additional carbs ended up acting more like a main. The sauce was so delicious and well-balanced that we asked for additional bread to shlop it all up. \n+ Speaking of which, our waiter said that the bread was short in the kitchen and had to be toasted, etc. but it had a great custardy crumb and crispy crust and overall great structure, so I didn't notice any shortcomings at all!\n+ Peach goat cheesecake presentation wasn't anything special, but was it YUM! The peach compote wasn't too sweet, very fruit-forward, and the goat cheese wasn't too strong. The crust was delicious and the texture of the goat cream cheese was light, creamy, and not too dense. Every bite was on point!\n+ Got the Titanic cocktail and was a fan! The texture of the ice was subtle and the flavors were nicely balanced. Not a terribly alcoholic drink, but a well-composed and balanced one nonetheless!\n+~ 3 people at the front of the house--the person at the host stand was super energetic and kept us updated on the table availability. And the other 2 at our table were attentive and kind, albeit a bit unenthusiastic.\n- It took a bit to get us seated and started, but we did come in at a late hour, and had booked our reservation last-minute, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nAll in all I'd come here again and recommend it to others in the downtown/midtown area!",

        "text": "We came to celebrate our anniversary and unfortunately our waiter commandeered our celebration. Our waiter must be trying to become an actor because he was putting on quite an act. He spent 10 minutes explaining how he can accommodate us if we are in a rush after we told him we had to be out of there at a specific time. He spent so much time talking about bubbles, romanesco and filet madame that we were stressed and rushing to get out. His voice frequently changed and he bowed and smiled awkwardly repeatedly. He was so phony and kept telling us how delightful everything is (not asking, telling). He was a bit much to say the least. \n\nAs far as the food goes, the fried goat cheese balls were delicious. The duck breast was fatty though tasty. The gnocchi with lamb shoulder was tasty but small portion size. The waiter pushed the charred romanesco which was very disappointing. It was nearly raw and when we mentioned it being undercooked, the waiter said it is meant to be crunchy. He offered to have the chef cook it more but we didn't want to waste more time.  We didn't have time to taste dessert.\n\nDon't be fooled like us into paying for bottled water at $7/bottle. Our waiter didn't tell us that tap was an option. We only realized our mistake after seeing other tables with short glasses of water. We had a $12 glass of Syrah which was smooth.\n\nOverall this was a disappointing meal, though likely we would have had a more enjoyable experience had we had another waiter.",

        "text": "I wish I could write a more positive review as I enjoyed the crispy duck breast very much. Unfortunately, the service in this restaurant is extremely slow! We got our appetizer about 40 minutes after ordering it. The appetizer was fairly simple and tasted decent as we got their cured meats and cheese plate. However, the Agnolotti (English pea and ricotta purée, carrot butter, pea tendrils, carrot top oil) was a disaster. The peas were very hard and tasted raw but we didn't make a big deal out of it because we were tired of waiting. \nI initially wanted to give this restaurant 2 stars but it wouldn't do justice to the deliciously gooey Olive oil Gelato Sorbet and the Paris- Brest. If I go back there, I'll just go for their dessert.",
