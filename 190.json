We got a reservation for a New Year's Eve and had to wait a couple minutes for our table to be ready. Upon being seated, we got a basket of bread from our waiter (every additional basket is $2.50 but you don't need it!! The apps and portions are worth it)\n\nTo drink we got a bottle of red wine which was great and our waiter poured for us. To start we got the calamari which deliciously and not overly breaded or fried which made it great. For the main, I got the fettuccine allá Michaela and split a Caesar salad. Next time, I would do a half portion of pasta with a a full salad bc the salad was great and the pasta is great but it's nice to get the best of both worlds for the same price!! We all enjoyed our dishes and loved mine. The seafood was great and the portions were generous. Wait staff was awesome and the vibes are great. Would go again!",

        "text": "Great place for a date night! Got seated in the covered patio, which ended up being a lot better than indoors. The sun going down and the hanging lights set the mood and I preferred it over the dark setting indoors.\n\nYou start out with a piece of bruschetta (1 per person) and a basket of bread ($2.50 extra per basket if you want more bread). My favorite part is always the bread haha.\n\nHaven't had lasagna in forever and it did not disappoint. The waiter said he liked the homemade bolognese sauce, and I'm glad I listened to him. It was delicious! My husband ordered the fettuccine alla michela and he really enjoyed it (he can be very picky about pasta). I wasn't a fan of the sauce but the shrimp and scallops were perfectly cooked. There were a lot more shrimp and scallops than the pasta itself, which is pretty unusual, so it could be a smaller portion for some. My husband and I don't have that big of a stomach so it was a perfect amount (but we also did fill our stomachs with the bread).",

The parking lot is small and therefore they have Valet parking only. As we entered a lot of the serving staff were standing near the door in the bar area and everyone was smiling. Good sign in our opinion - staff are happy. Our server, Aniya, was very friendly and attentive. We ordered mussels as our appetizer and they were wonderful. Our meals, Peperoncini Eva and Lasagna, were very tasty. The shrimp in hubby's dish were well sauteed and took on the garlic wine sauce very well but were a little over cooked which surprised us. The marinara sauce used with the lasagna was bright and fresh and quite yummy - wish there was just a little more of it. For dessert we had the Italian cheesecake. We enjoyed our impromptu date night.",

Aliya was very informative and friendly and the rest of the staff was great as well. Cute decor and very cozy. All of our food was delicious. The calamari was amazing and I loved my fettuccine. Perfect portion and the seafood was delicious. My parents shared the almond tort with ice cream and I got a complimentary tiramisu that was outstanding. We will definitely be back!",

        "text": "First and foremost, the food was fantastic. I want to put that up front. Calamari Fritti, Insalata della Casa, Fettucine Allá Michela, and the special pasta of the day, which was described as a rotini and shrimp in a lemon garlic oil sauce. \n\nYes, it's Valet parking, which is $5.  We had a birthday dinner reservation. We were a little early and waited at the bar for our table. Lovely glass of montepulciano and an old fashioned, reasonably priced. The decor is traditional Italian rustic, dimly lit, nicely decorated. All tables were full. \n\n2 couples were seated before us after our reservation time, both in corner booths. We were seated at the table by the wait station so had a steady flow of waitstaff by the table the whole night. Okay, fine, it happens. We'll live. Waiter comes to the table with water, very pleasant. \n\nThe calamari was really good, and the fra diávolo sauce was excellent. Then we split a house salad, a Gorgonzola and walnut, which had very delicious greens. Then we ordered the Fettucine Allá Michela and the pasta special. \n\nThe scallops in the Fettucine dish were excellent. Tender, flavorful, and very tasty. The special of the day, which we asked twice for a description, was rotini with shrimp and a garlic sauce. I got a plate of shrimp served on...capellini. Told the food runner we ordered the special, and he assured us it was the special. We called the waiter over and he was not concerned in the least - he just kind of blinked at me for a minute. WTF. He then said he never said rotini, he said rigatoni. I said this is not rigatoni either. I had tasted it and it was delicious, so I just said I would eat it so my date's food didn't get cold. We did inform the maitre d that it happened. Fortunate accident because that was some of the best shrimp and lemon capellini I've had in my life. For dessert the waiter recommended the chocolate mousse cake and it was also very delicious. The food was top notch start to finish.  \n\nIf you made it this far, now comes the surreal part: I pulled my phone out and got a picture of rigatoni and when the waiter came by, I showed him the picture, said this is rigatoni, and my dish is capellini. He just blinked, gestured at my plate, and said yes, it's rigatoni. At that point I was speechless. I have no idea what that was.",

Sasha was our waiter and he was very kind. \n\nMy girlfriend and I visited Nino's for a date night on a Saturday. Although the parking lot was packed, we did not have to wait to be seated. We both ordered the Fettuccine Alla Michela. I had it regularly and my girlfriend ordered hers without scallops and extra shrimp. It was fantastic. The saffron cream sauce placed a twist on the traditional fettuccine experience. It was a little sweet and blended with the seared scallops and shrimp perfectly. The fresh made pasta was absolutely delicious. \n\nWe also enjoyed a bottle of wine and some calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was very fresh but it was lightly battered and not as crispy as we would have liked. It was almost too chewy. \n\nOther than that, we'd certainly visit again and explore other things on the menu.",

I have never eaten a full plate at an Italian restaurant until Ninos. \n\nNinos is a 2nd generation family owned Italian restaurant. If you want a local wonderful family owned place, go here.

Glad I brought my pashmina! I'm server was kind into the point. Hopeful and deciding between two pasta dishes. I think he made a great suggestion. Knowing that I only have about 70% of my taste buds I have to say that my supper was delicious, my Malbac was tasty it complemented it well, and the company was lovely!

Order that and you will be happy.\n\n3 of us went on a Friday night around 7:30 and were seated right away...because we had reservations. I definitely encourage everyone to make reservations because this place gets packed for the dinner rush.\n\nOne of my friends ordered the fettuccine alfredo and the other ordered Torchietti Vodka. Let me just tell you...unless you're a basic bish...do NOT order the alfredo at a fancy restaurant. It's like the annoying kid that your mom told you to be nice to and play with but no one wants around. It definitely tasted that way here. I mean, they have their Fettucine Alla Michela which probably tasted 100 times better, but noooo she ordered that nonsense. She tried it, I tried it, my other friend tried it and we all hated it and they were gracious enough to swap it out for the Eva AND comped it on top of that.\n\nThe Torchietti Vodka was really really good and so was my Eva. \nI think I'm going to name my future daughter that. Yes...after this pasta dish hahaha!\n\nFriendly and attentive staff and great ambience...not too brightly lit. Perfect for slurping up pasta without feeling watched.\n\nI will definitely be back the next time I'm in ATL!",

        "text": "Meh. Was craving some authentic italian pasta, something saucy and rich so I decided to try Nino's. The atmosphere was nice. Dark lighting, candles, etc. Our waiter was an elderly Italian guy that gave the bare minimum service-wise. I ordered a calamari and before I could even ask for a glass of Pinot Grigio he had already left the table without saying a word. Weird.\n\nAnyway, the calamari was unseasoned. It had a nice breading but lacked flavor overall. I NEVER add salt to my food, and the fact that I had to add salt and pepper to this calamari was telling. The Caesar salads were pretty tasty. It was actually my favorite part of the meal.\n\nI played it safe by trying the chicken parmigiana for my entree. This was also...unseasoned. Also it tasted as if my cutlet had been fried in old grease. So in addition to an overall lack of flavor, it had this dirty greasy aftertaste that was just unappetizing. I ate maybe two or three bites and didn't want anymore. I heard that Italians are known for under seasoning food, relying on garlic, herbs, and fresh vegetables to give food flavor. I'd be ok with this if my dish incorporated all those elements, but it really just fell flat.\n\nBetween the mediocre food and crappy service, I'm in no rush to return anytime soon. Thanks but no thanks, Nino's.",

I had the Chicken Parmesean which was ok, but not the greatest. It had too much sauce which took away from the entree. My boyfriend had the Torchietti Gabriela and it was delicious, the mozzarella was extremely fresh! The atmosphere was pleasant and service was great. Would highly recommend!",

        "text": "I visited Nino's on a Tuesday Night at around 9:30PM. Nino's at this time is a quiet, calm, and quaint Italian restaurant with a beautiful 7 to\n8 seat bar. The restaurant also has a cute small eating section, a real Italian feel. The lighting is very romantic and PERFECT for dates. Ladies, if you have small mistakes in your makeup, this place will make you feel comfortable, because the lights are dim enough. It's has a sexy feel. You can also bring your own bottles of wine for an up charge of $25 per bottle. This restaurant is slightly on the upscale side, so expect for plates to range  from 18 to 30ish dollars. Everything is worth it at this time and location. I'm not sure how the place is on the weekends. Reservations can be made which is awesome. The staff was also friendly, inviting, and knowledgeable.",
